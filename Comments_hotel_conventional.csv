0,The Chesterfield Mayfair,Fantastic hotel and staff who were extremely friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect and I would recommended this hotel to anyone. We have stayed at numerous top London hotels but the service and the quality at the Mayfair matched these.
1,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"My Girlfriend and I went to The Chesterfield Mayfair in May 2023 to have the Gin tasting experience. It was presented by two lovely members of the team Alexandro and Viviana. I learned so much about the origin of Gin and how different types are made, what spices are used, also learned about the best tonic match to certain type of gins. They made it so interesting and engaging, furthermore any questions were asked by us they responded in a really friendly way with excitement to pass on the knowledge they had. If anyone is interested in learning about from the process of gin making to tasting it I highly recommend doing this experience! Big thank you to the guys! Gabor Koncz"
2,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield has an excellent location, close to many attractions. Food and service were excellent, In particular we want to mention concierge Jake who was proactively helpful on several occasions. Overall, this place is a gem. Andy M"
3,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Viviane is AMAZING! She is so kind and welcoming. You can tell she truly loves her job. We are so glad that she was able to serve us. Viviane is very kind and friendly, the perfect person to serve you! We can’t wait to come back!"
4,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"This hotel is just the best! Everyone is very nice and helpful. From a bottle of water to a ride to the Beyoncé concert, we felt taken care of. We were so impressed with the kindness, helpfulness, comforts, and safety that we felt at The Chesterfield Mayfair. I wish that I could call out individuals who helped us, but truly everyone was wonderful!❤️"
5,The Chesterfield Mayfair,The Chesterfield is a classic and cosy hotel in an excellent quiet location. We love the bar. We got back from a concert at the O2 after 11pm and the bar welcomed us and offered food. Staff are welcoming and friendly. This is regular hotel for nights out in London.
6,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"My husband and I stayed at the Chesterfield for our 2 year anniversary in May 2023. We have been to the Chesterfield a few times before, and have always been delighted by the service we've experienced. It therefore made sense to go and stay again for a special occasion. Where better that a hotel that actively describes itself as ""Your House?"" A perfect home away from home in the heart of London. I'll be candid, we've been visiting the Chesterfield for the last two years on and off, whether to stay for the odd special occasion, or to go for drinks on a Saturday when we used to live a little closer, and we are familiar with the smiling faces of the team who work there. There have been a few changes recently, some which a lot of establishments would struggle with: the Bar Manager…"
7,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"This about the 7th time I have stayed at the Chesterfield, in Mayfair. . Not only in a great location (Green Park tu be stop) but the best staff ever! Particularly Darren, one of the concierges. He got the cars arranged for the theaters we went to, etc. They have really old school service-when it goes wrong, they fix it. I had a massive nose bleed and all they cared about was that I got a new pillow when I was worried about the linens! They wanted to send a doc to me, but I knew I'd be fine, so declined. There are many eating options near by. All the meals in the hotel are good, but pricey. Room service is sky high! There is an M &S simply food at the tube stop. Good selection! This is NOT an inexpensive hotel! You need to work the 4 for 3 deal, 4 nights for the price…"
8,The Chesterfield Mayfair,Super hotel - great staff. Came to experience high quality luxury hotel service -- The Chesterfield really delivered. all the staff were super with that fabulous blend of both high professionalism and personal friendly touch. Reception and front desk reception team - great. Restaurant and bar staff -- excellent too. (food absolutely perfect at every meal) F & B team very attentive and first class
9,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"There are a ton of hotels in London but the Chesterfield is a nice small and quaint hotel that provides the British field and is close to the tube, park, and Buckingham Palace. My adult daughter and I just stayed and enjoyed the entire staff, did the afternoon tea, and dinner. Ate late night in the bar as well. Everything was spot on and we could not have asked for better."
10,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"With so many choices in London this turned out to be great choice. Has charm of an English hotel and smaller than top chains in same area. Was excellent central location, clean rooms, great ambience, friendly and helpful staff. Enjoy the tea room or live music in lounge in the evening. Plenty of different plug types in room which is convenient. Made us feel very special for our 35 year anniversary. Wow, nice touch, thanks. Only small ask is to make it easier to plug phone in to charge at night next to bed. But could get to behind nightstand so really an issue. Thanks!"
11,The Chesterfield Mayfair,The Gin & Tonic experience that we have done at the Chesterfield Mayfair Bar was incredible! Viviana explained everything super clean and we learnt so much from her. Alexandro and Marilene have been super nice as well. Such a memorable moment there! Many thanks for your professional customer service.
12,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"I’ve stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair 6 or 7 times now and I keep returning because of the location, great atmosphere and decor, friendly service, and excellent breakfast. I was there for one week, checking out just a couple days before the coronation. Thought most room types were sold out, the lobby and other areas of the hotel were never crowded (besides breakfast, where there was sometimes a 15-20 minute wait). I normally stay in a Classic Double, but reserved a Classic Single (Room 714) because other rooms options were unavailable at the time of booking. Though well designed and with a nice view facing the front of the hotel, there was very little space. I was unable to store my suitcases away, and there were no drawers or any space for storage besides a tiny closet. The…"
13,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a beautiful older hotel. Our room was on the second floor. During our stay the hotel’s hairdryer would trip a breaker rendering the hairdryer useless. The front desk swapped out our hairdryer for another. It worked for a few minutes and then out it went. Unfortunately it happened 30 minutes before we were to attend our niece’s wedding. My wife worked on her hair whilst it air dried. The front desk person said they’d bring another hairdryer. It never arrived. The next day I told them we still had the problem and gave me a third hairdryer. And, they said a maintenance person would come to discuss the situation. Our discussion revealed that the second floor of the hotel had very old electrical and that was the root of the problem. Other international…"
14,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"We went to the hotel for the Gin&tonic experience. It was really amazing, we know now how was the process in the past and how many types of gin we can have around the world, Alejandro prepared for us amazing drinks, and explain us everything for more than 1hour and half, the hotel, installation and the workers was really awesome, very nice and British vibe. We want to back again next month for another one experience. Thanks Namrata and Glenda too for your attention. good bless"
15,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"We were instant family when we stepped into the foyer of the Chesterfield. However, it was Mustafa with his friendly welcome and care that brightened our day as we stepped from our taxi. Into the reception we sailed where Ellen and Heather were wonderfully efficient and affable. Giorgi kindly whisked our luggage to our room — we were delighted with the ambience and the comely decor. Every little item of comfort was enjoyed from our extensive tea/coffee service to our bathroom robes and nightly turn down with chocolates. The Chesterfield ensured our comfort and made our stay in London effortless. A delightful experience! An excellent culture!"
16,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Chesterfield Mayfair was terrific! 1st class hospitality. All staff were very friendly and helpful. It’s hard to single any one staff member out- check in counter and concierge were particularly helpful. The location was great as well. Very close to pubs and restaurants. Within walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Churchill War Museum, Westminster Abbey, etc."
17,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Absolutely amazing stay. The service was impeccable and I plan to be back. Jozef in the lobby is so friendly and helpful. Rafal (and another lady I forget her name) in the Butler Restaurant treated us like royalty for dinner (dinner was also delicious!) The housekeepers were also very helpful and kind, eagerly asking us if we needed anything. One of the days we had to leave early for a day long tour. Since we needed to leave before breakfast service started, we asked if we could get anything beforehand. The concierge was very helpful, and had two boxes of pastries and fruits ready for us that morning. After coming back that day (12+ hours later), we came back to the room exhausted but delighted to see turn down service and my weighted blanket (I am a very picky sleeper so I…"
18,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"My daughter and I spent two days at this hotel at the end of our 2 week stay in the UK. The hotel is very elegant and the staff is so friendly and very helpful. They go out of their way to be of service and treat you like you belong at the hotel, not like other hotels on this scale that would at you like you don't belong. The front staff the concierge desk and the doormen were so friendly and very accommodating when helping us navigate the city. The bar staff were also friendly and spent time talking with you, if they weren't busy. This is a very quaint hotel that reminds me of the old Waldorf Astoria in NYC. I would definitely stay there again."
19,The Chesterfield Mayfair,An excellent property & the staff are top notch. Everyone is welcoming and helpful with a wealth of knowledge about the city. Rooms are well appointed with all the amenities and very clean. Location is great too. A special thanks to Saffron at the front desk and Josef & the concierge/bell staff!
20,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Both the room and the experience were absolutely wonderful. The most memorable part of our trip? The Concierge, Jake. This is man who does not simply direct you to restaurants, he actually walks you to them! I have never experienced that kind of customer service, and I can't imagine anyone, anyone at all, would not have much the same experience with Jake and the Chesterfield Mayfair. It was a phenomenal place, highlighted by a phenomenal staff. Bill O'Connell"
21,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"We have stayed at The Chesterfield numerous times over the last few years, and have always experienced first class service, extremely friendly staff and excellent food. The bar offers a knowledgeable drinks service, a good choice of bar snacks and live music - we love going to sit in there and enjoy the experience. Bedrooms are lovely and we always try to book a king size room as the classic rooms are limited in size. The breakfast offers a large choice, and vegetarians and vegans are catered for with no problems. As mentioned, we have always received first class service from all staff at The Chesterfield, and they are willing to go over and above what is required to help you. We could not speak highly enough of them. The hotel is situated in an excellent part of Mayfair, …"
22,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield Mayfair is a real gem that will give travelers a taste of real British charm. The staff were more than gracious. The rooms, restaurant, bar and lobby are beautifully decorated. We enjoyed the cozy and welcoming bar after long days of visiting the many attractions London has to offer. The bartenders can always make you a drink that is different and delicious. We also had a wonderful dinner and breakfast daily in the restaurant. The food was very good. We suggest having at least one dinner in the hotel to enjoyed the stellar service and top-notch cuisine. The service was excellent and the staff were more than accommodating. My husband and I also loved the location. The hotel is on a quiet street in Mayfair, close to many great restaurants, pubs and shopping. The…"
23,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Going to London has been on my bucket list for years. I booked this trip for myself and my daughter when she turned 18 — it was a combo birthday, Christmas, and high school graduation gift. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, these vacation plans were canceled three times. However, we finally made it 2 1/2 years later, coincidentally landing in London on the day of King Charles' coronation. This was a package booked through Costco Travel, and my best friend suggested we stay here, based on the online reviews. Boy, I'm so glad she steered us this way. The experience at the Chesterfield Mayfair was nothing but top-notch. The place itself was beautiful, the architecture, décor, and structure itself so intricate. It was so charming and lovely, as was the staff. I can't commend…"
24,The Chesterfield Mayfair,Just got back from a week At the Chesterfield Mayfair in London. LOVED IT! The best part was the staff. Everyone made you feel like you were at home. I know a lot of places say they do this but honestly this was how I felt the whole time I was there. Thank you for making our trip so special and great. Location was very good. Rooms spotless. Food great!
25,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"A great stay, our second and hopefully not our last. The Hotel is very well managed, traditional, and homely. We love it and the staff. They are exceptional, they obviously love their job and we were really surprised to be recognised after our visit last year. They are natural, friendly and enjoy talking to you, they enjoy making your stay a special one. Location is great, just a few minutes from the tube and Green Park. Mustn't forget the wonderful linen on the bed, or the bed itself! Very comfortable. The dinner we had in the hotel was really excellent, service to match."
26,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Incredible afternoon tea. The service from savolta was amazing. It made my celebration so special. Food was beautiful and such a wonderful array of teas. The ambiance was relaxed, not rushed and a very personalised level of service."
27,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The Chesterfield is our home away from home when we're in London because the staff always go above and beyond to make our stay magical from the welcome note to remembering which tea & biscuit flavors we prefer in our room. The location is also convenient - a short walk to multiple Tube lines, Buckingham Palace, Green Park and shopping (Bond Street & Oxford Street). Butler's Restaurant (in the hotel) is also a treat - the staff is attentive and the food is wonderful - the fish & chips are our favorite!"
28,The Chesterfield Mayfair,The hotel was in a perfect location. The room was well appointed and the staff was very courteous. Would absolutely recommend to anyone visiting London. It situated away from the crowds but in a great neighborhood with good amenities!
29,The Chesterfield Mayfair,What a wonderful hotel experience! The most amazing staff from front door to housekeeping! They have a fabulous piano player on the weekends - we had a BLAST! Try out the lavender cocktail and the espresso martini. The afternoon tea is delicious! Location is just 8 minute walk from Green Park station Underground and so close to many fantastic restaurants! We would recomment and would stay there again. We went for the coronation and just had a wonderful time.
30,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Dear Travellers, I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair in early May--Coronation week. My family is in the hotel business in the UK. I am reasonably familiar with the inner workings of what makes a hotel ""tick."" This hotel ticks all the boxes: location, cleanliness, excellent food, well-appointed rooms, value for money, and the ""secret sauce,"" staff who really give a ""damn"" for the customer. I used the mild expletive because staff concern for hotel guests isn't always genuine. Shout outs to: Evelina and Cyan in the Dining Room; Saffron and Amy at the Front Desk; and my behind-the-scenes friend, Christina. Can't wait to return in the Fall. Bravo."
31,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"What a treat! We stayed just one night to be close to the Coronation celebrations. From the moment we arrived, all of the front office and concierge team were super friendly and very helpful - nothing too much! The bed was like a cloud of comfort, lovely size and some very much appreciated personal touches. The box of teas, coffees and treats were of great quality. the bathroom and fluffy towels with fab Floris toiletries were a treat. Umbrellas to borrow so we didn't get wet (again!) and a lovely lunch in between festivities. Finally, it's the best neighbourhood to stay in - so central yet quiet. All round great. We will be back!"
32,The Chesterfield Mayfair,The staff is top rate and respond to your every need and the breakfast served daily was fantastic. The hotel location is walk-able to almost everything you want to see when visiting London. On our next trio back we will again be staying at the Chesterfield Mayfair
33,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"This is a lovely small hotel in an excellent location, our superior twin rooms was a good size for London with comfortable bed and luxurious bedding. We encountered a few members of staff from the friendly doorman to the reception and bar staff. Our room wasn't ready on time due a problem with the linens but the offer of a complimentary drink and canapes in the bar while we waited was most welcome and more than made up for it. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel so can't comment on that but we really enjoyed our stay."
34,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The friendliest staff of any hotel that I have stayed in. The rooms are a bit small, but everything else about the hotel more than makes up for it. Breakfast is a feast, the staff are amazing, the location is perfect and the ambience is superb. It’s a four star hotel that casts a long shadow over many of the five star hotels. Strongly recommended."
35,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Booked the sweet themed afternoon tea as something a little different and enjoyed every minute. Situated in the conservatory, the room was lovely and the food absolutely delicious. A range of real delights including the incredible selection of teas. Service was not perfect but the fact that the staff were fantastic meant it didn't have a negative impact on our visit. Every single one of them was approachable, smiley, willing to interact and just a pleasure to deal with so thank you for making our treat so special"
36,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Great location, very friendly staff, good and ample breakfast (included in our room fee), attractive public rooms and restaurant. We had two rooms for two adults and two teens. Our rooms were clean but a bit tired, dark, cramped and didn't have good views. We only stayed one night and had come from a super-modern, light and bright hotel in another city, so when we return we might try the Chesterfield Mayfair again for a longer stay to give it another try. For our 20-hour stay that included two rooms and breakfast we paid approximately £850."
37,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"The hotel is charming, the food is wonderful and the staff are top notch. Thank you for a wonderful visit! The Chesterfield is in a central location. London was a delight and did not disappoint on the weather either."
38,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"From the moment you enter this beautiful space you are treated with care. Salvatore and Josef are simply perfection. They make it their mission to help in any way they can. Their professionalism is unmatched! All of the staff that we encountered throughout the Chesterfield were kind, polite and ever so helpful. The room is clean, well appointed and the bed is very comfortable. We had a great stay and highly recommend the Chesterfield."
39,The Chesterfield Mayfair,I attended a lunch for the first time at the Chesterfield recently . I was struck by how friendly and professional all the staff were at the hotel .Everyone without exception couldn't have been nicer .
40,The Chesterfield Mayfair,We stayed here in April and had a great stay . The hotel was beautiful and the staff was great and very helpful and it was a excellent location. Easy to walk to many great restaurants and historic sites . Highly recommend staying here if you visit London.
41,The Chesterfield Mayfair,Had the best time having the cream tea.Willy Wonka style. Was treated like like royalty by Rafal. As my wife and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary the waiting staff pulled out all the stops. All the staff were fantastic especially Rafal. We will definitely be back. All the staff in the hotel were professional from reception to catering. Thank you all for the good memories.
42,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"My hubby and I were in London for 9 days and spent 5 nights at the Chesterfield Mayfair. This is my review. Pro- • Location is great. The station is Green Park, so three lines go through there (Victoria, Jubilee and Piccadilly). Very convenient. The hotel is located about 8 minutes away from the station, a quiet neighborhood, so I really like it how when you go to sleep, it is quiet. • Staff is friendly and helpful. There is just no complaining about their outstanding services. • Housekeeping puts a cookie on your pillow each time they service your room! And we appreciate the bottled water too (though we just drink tap water and boil the tap water for hot beverages). By the way, I appreciate so much about the creamer from glass bottles, not the little plastic ones. Con - a…"
43,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"I recently brought my mom to London to celebrate her 65th birthday, and our stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair was absolutely perfect! The staff were so friendly & helpful. The decor is beautiful. The room was clean, comfortable, and had everything we needed. The location was perfect for sightseeing, exploring, eating, & shows. We were able to walk to Buckingham, Westminster, Soho, and the West End, and the hotel was just a short walk from the tube or bud for everything else. The hotel bar was excellent - the bartenders were so personable & the pianist at night is a great touch. Everyone went out of their way to make my mom feel special on her birthday, and it was so memorable for her. I would highly recommend this hotel!"
44,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"THis is one of my favorites in London. Food is good, nice bar, clean rooms, friendly and helpful staff! I go frequently with an art group and we always feel welcome. Joseph and Amy were both great."
45,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"We had a fabulous stay here because all the staff were so incredibly friendly and helpful! In particular, Agnelo was incredibly helpful and our last day, he sent us off in a cab to the airport with cappuccinos to go and a few tasty pastries! Jake was also helpful with our dinner planning and Sam was always helpful with anything too. Our room was lovely and the breakfast was wonderful- we will definitely stay again and I highly recommend it as its in a great London location too!"
46,The Chesterfield Mayfair,My family and I went for afternoon tea for my daughters 6th Birthday. The ambiance was perfect. Staff were very helpful and friendly. As we entered Andrej was very welcoming and especially Ella and Caitlin who were very attentive. Would definitely revisit again
47,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"Service was impeccable. The hotel staff was very helpful, courteous, and professional. They went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. Sam, in particular, assisted us far beyond the call of duty in making sure that our experience was first-rate. We couldn’t be happier with the hotel and will be returning soon. Thank you to all."
48,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"A wonderful afternoon tea with magical service in a great setting. Really amazing experience that you just cannot beat. We had 12 of us together aged from 9 to over 70 and we all loved it, especially the delicious cakes!"
49,The Chesterfield Mayfair,"This was the best hotel stay I’ve ever had. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are lovely, breakfast is superb, location is great and the staff are polite, courteous, helpful and totally look after you. It was perfect. 10 out of 10 :)"
50,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Good Radisson property at a very central location. Good friendly service especially during breakfast session. Room is spacious and clean. Decent recognition of Radisson VIP status, room was upgraded but probably not towards the best category as what was advertised/promised by the membership."
51,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","We stayed at The Edwardian in celebration of finishing my degree & they did not disappoint in the slightest!! First off we were greeted by the loveliest staff members who upgraded our room on their behalf as they knew this was for celebratory purposes, staff were very helpful and lovely, always willing to help or answer any questions that we had had. The room was gorgeous, absolutely no faults & also when we made it to our room we had a specially made dessert waiting for us. The spa just really topped off our whole stay, we used it twice whilst we were there & felt no pressure to stick to the hour time limit allocated to us, we were not rushed out & they let us have as much time as we liked really & we left regardless when it got busier in the evening, it was very clean, well…"
52,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Absolutely incredible, the best night away I have ever had, we were well taken care of from the start and greeted in a friendly way, we had a problem with out key card but that wasn’t anyone’s fault so carnt put it against the hotel, once in the room both me and my girlfreind were blown away by our room, due to our special occasion we were upgraded room and it did not disappoint one bit, bed was Compfy the shower was warm with good pressure, service was perfect, the modernism was like no other, really felt amazing and will 100% return. The only thing I would say is that £43 for breakfast is quite high, it is self serviced which was nice and the welcome was amazing by the host it just felt a little high for breakfast but wouldn’t deny it if came back"
53,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","We stayed at the Edwardian this weekend and I honestly cannot recommend this hotel enough. We had planned to stay for our first wedding anniversary last month but due to unforeseen circumstances we had to cancel our trip last minute. The staff at the hotel alongside the spa & gym staff were exceptionally accommodating and kindly allowed us to rearrange our hotel booking and spa treatments. When we arrived at the hotel, we were impressed with the welcome and we were upgraded to a beautiful suite. We went down to the spa & gym to use the facilities and enjoy our pre booked treatments but unfortunately I had realised I had rebooked the treatments for the wrong date. This was completely my fault but the staff at the spa did everything they could to fit us in despite being…"
54,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Excellent service from all of the hotel staff. They rooms were modern and so clean. The beds, pillows and bedding were so comfortable. The spa and swimming pool was the nicest and cleanest pool I have been too."
55,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",Staff were really friendly and concierge were extremely attentive. Beds were very uncomfortable hard and flat duvet/pillows. Head board was very thin. Air con in room gave my partner and I a terrible cold as we couldn’t open ang windows for fresh air
56,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Very good hotel experience overall, best location and fab staff making us feel welcome. Hotel bar and restaurant is top notch. The Spa is a delight too. It’s the best we’ve experienced in the city for some years now."
57,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","My wife and I stayed two nights in May 2023. The staff and accommodations were wonderful, and the location is relatively close to some great shopping. However, the greatest feature is their Head Concierge, Gary Roberts. He is absolutely a Jedi Master, who has raised his profession to a higher art form. He is the go to person for information, including how to get tickets for entertainment. He will make sure you enjoy your stay."
58,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Second time visiting this hotel, and definitely not disappointed. As before, staff were friendly and helpful. The standard of the room is excellent. If I had to find a very small irritation, it is that the breakfast room is very cramped, but the quality of the breakfast made up for it."
59,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Excellent and historic hotel, centrally located in Manchester. Superb staff and facilities, especially Head Concierge, Gary, and truly wonderful spa and gym. Was made to feel at home from check in to check out and any requests were met with a positive and thoughtful response."
60,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Did not like that i was given a handicap room as a twin room And there was no room cleaning during stay, witch I think should be standard with this price level, swimming pool was lovely and the breakfast was superb"
61,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Great hotel overall. Not many things that would need improvement, maybe some of the furniture in the rooms. Location is great, hotel clean, staff polite and welcoming, food was solid. Did not have a chance to check out the fitness area, but heard it is great too. Recommendations for this hotel."
62,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Beautiful hotel, great rooms and facilotoes. Great location, close to everything. Alot of food options around. Very friendly. Very good area to stay in Manchester. All was excellent during my travel. Thank you"
63,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",From the outside the hotel looks fabulous but step inside and it feels super luxury! All of the staff are friendly and welcoming too with every interaction. Lovely rooms with everything you need and fab location - thank you for another great stay!
64,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Everything was perfect, from the staff at check in and in the bar, location is perfect, close to everything, the room is spotlessly clean, robes and slippers provided in the room, the bathroom is excellent with a bath and separate shower, free water in the mini fridge. Spa facilities are superb, would definitely recommend"
65,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","We had an awful smell in the room when we arrived back after midnight, had to request to move rooms, staff were helpful in the most part but when I brought it up in the morning they didn’t apologise for our inconvenience. Also the sauna was out of service. Apart from this we had a pleasant stay."
66,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Whilst expensive, this Hotel ensures the price is very worth it, the bed was sooo comfortable & the service was a step above in every area of the Hotel. Beautiful breakfast & the spar & swimming pool are stunning."
67,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Excellent hotel, the building was beautiful and the room was spotless. Staff were very helpful and friendly and the breakfast was absolutely awesome. The location was perfect, right in the center and everything was very close by."
68,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","It’s a real pleasure to stay at the Edwardian in Manchester. The customer service and attention to detail is great especially from the Customer relations Manager, Barnaby, who goes the extra mile to make your stay extra special. I would definitely recommend staying at the Radisson in Manchester. Andy"
69,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",The best and most relaxing experience at the spa. First time experience and it couldn’t have been better. Can’t thank Suzanna enough for her service during our time there. Can’t recommend it enough. Thank you Suzanna!
70,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",Good leasure club great location & restaurant Recommend lovely staff great location drain smell or would of 5 starred breakfast lovely staff friendly & efficient if your visiting central Manchester worth considering. Not brill to drive to & park
71,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",My wife and I stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon and we absolutely had a blast. It’s one of the best hotel in Manchester with exceptional service and perfect location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The best part about it was it’s location and the convenience it offers to their guests.
72,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","This hotel ticks all the boxes for a luxury stay in Manchester. Central location, gorgeous decor and well sized rooms cleaned to a high standard with all the facilities you need. Great leisure facilities and lovely staff. Really nice selection of breakfast options"
73,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","This hotel looks the part online and still does as you walk in the door. Unfortunately it lacks atmosphere and to be honest feels sterile and stripped of any real character. Rooms are basic and are at most slightly better than a Premier Inn. Also the rooms are in my mind extremely hot and lacking proper air con. Staff are pleasant though. Honestly go elsewhere as there are hotels nearby, The Kimpton, for example which provide a much better all round experience. Tried it once won’t be back."
74,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Hotels lovely and clean , staff are very helpful. Gym and sauna facilities are fantastic if you’re looking for a spa weekend . Only thing letting it down is the smart tv . Only few channels have got reception and the tv is not compatible with anything ."
75,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","I stayed at the Manchester Edwardian with a friend for 2 nights when we first arrived in England. It was Easter weekend, and a football team was staying, so the place was packed. I was jet lagged, so maybe that's why the extremely loud thumpa-thumpa music in the restaurant got on my nerves. Our room with 2 beds was large and comfortable, although whoever designed the bathroom didn't think about including shelf space to put your toiletries. (This is a very common flaw in hotels, I find.) It was too modern inside for my taste -- I prefer more of the original historic features in a historic building. The breakfast buffet was excellent, though -- guacamole toast is an extravagance. There was also a nice separate cocktail lounge so you have a public option apart from the loud bar &…"
76,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",Will never stay there again!! Myself & friends spent a lot of money staying there for a long weekend and despite trying to explain a booking mix up they showed no flexibility so will ensure we never stay there again. Also stayed there in 2015 when it was much more plush and felt more like a 5 star hotel. Very unhappy customer.
77,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Amazing Hotel! Fabulous facilities pool was Good, sizing a little small however well looked after, and catered too fully. Reception staff was 24/7. And had plenty of Safety procedures. Keys to access lift and Doors. Access past 2am requires a Room key, only issues was coding with Keys, sometimes doesn’t works. Staffs resolved them Quickly. In room service was Amazing. Only issue was the Size and price"
78,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","This is a hotel I have stayed at numerous times and have always felt that they exceeded my expectations in every way possible, and have always left 5* glowing reviews as it was previously deserved. It must be said that on this visit, some of the staff must be commended for upholding the high standards I previously experienced. Danny at check in gave an exceptional and informative check in experience, and through my stay of 2 nights, went out of his way to ensure that everything I needed was provided along with his manager Barnaby. The same with Gary on concierge, nothing was too much for him and Eva in the restaurant who served breakfast and Givan who served us in the Library bar. These members of staff need to be recognised for allowing me to see the Edwardian standards…"
79,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Expected more for the price. Was supposed to be a treat but didn’t feel like one. Pros: comfy bed, large room, clean, good service, good shower. Thick towels. Cons: sachets of crap coffee and milk (come on, this isn’t a budget hotel), noise from outside woke me at 530am, doors slamming, extortionate drinks prices, blinds didn’t adequately cover the window. Shower gels etc bolted to the wall, Some good elements but more attention needed to those little things that make all of the difference."
80,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Fantastic for one night stay, great location, beautiful bar and restaurant, lobby area really airy and welcoming. My room on the 12th floor had an amazing view. The pool and spa area is fantastic. The staff at check on were very friendly."
81,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","First time guests at this hotel and cannot rate it highly enough. Check in very prompt, we had a suite on the 6th floor. Spotlessly clean, bottled water provided in the fridge & it even had a Nespresso machine. All the staff we met were very friendly and professional. The champagne bar was fun, breakfast very tasty-plenty of choice at the buffet and waiter service for tea and coffee orders. Cannot wait to return when we’ll take advantage of the spa facilities. We had no time to use these facilities-we went to have a look-the pool looked very inviting! Thanks to all who made our stay perfect!"
82,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",Our receptionist and host at the Edwardian hotel Manchester (Katerina) was absolutely brilliant she deservers a pay rise. She was so polite and help me and my friend settle in and assisted with every single thing we needed. She is an example of an excellent receptionist and hostes. We loved her and she deserves to be a maneger. Seriously!! Thank your for your help and hope u enjoy your day katherina!
83,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","The best part of this hotel is the spa, can’t fault it. We visited it twice in our stay and will be coming back just for that. The breakfast is good, fresh and very tasty and the location is perfect for bars/restaurants/shopping - all within walking distance"
84,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",A good city centre hotel with a few pros and few cons: Pros - central location - very friendly and helpful staff - spacious rooms Cons - the hardest bed I’ve experienced in a hotel - no parking available with the hotel and no special rates for hotel guests at nearby car parks meant I spent a fortune on it - decor seems somewhat tired and dated - bathroom counter was cracked and rusted I think for the same price there are better alternatives nearby
85,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Throughly enjoyed stayng at the Edwardian. It's a lovely City Centre hotel with comfortable rooms. The spa has a pool, sauna and steam room. The food was top quality with an extensive selection for breakfast. All the staff were friendly and extremely helpful, especially Katerina on reception"
86,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","5 stars experience! I had such a lovely time at this hotel, excellent accommodation with nice spa, comfortable premium room,nice atmosphere, safe and clean place! 100% recommended! 2munutes distance from Casino, restaurants and bars!"
87,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Stayed for two nights for a conference. Convenient parking just across the road. Great, attentive staff and atmosphere in the hotel. Room and breakfast were great. Really recommend the gym and spa facilities. Rally good location for getting to the centre of Manchester"
88,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Tired rooms and communal corridors. Needs a refurb/refresh. Spa, gym and breakfast room is lovely though. Air con made a lot of noise and temp wouldn’t lower. Had an awful nights sleep because of this. For the price I’d try somewhere else next time."
89,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","We booked this hotel for a weekend away after staying somewhere else previously, and having eaten in Peter Street Kitchen and seeing the lobby/spa facilities, thought it would be incredible and worth the extra. Unfortunately, the rooms are really disappointing. Very basic, and we were ""upgraded"" to the 10th floor. The spa, restaurant and indeed the service was fantastic - the front desk staff were brilliant - but the rooms really let the hotel down and was disappointing. The photos of the rooms are slightly misleading, in my view - unless we had a bad room?"
90,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","We found the Edwardian an amazing hotel friendly staff with an amazing room, the hotel decor is stunning. The location is great 2 min from the tram station or a 10 min walk into the centre of town, the breakfast was really nice everything on offer and was great to chat to the staff. My wife left her jacket in the room when we left i contacted the hotel and they posted it to our hose which was fantastic great service."
91,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Amazing trip start to finish, front desk staff extremely welcoming,amazing facilities included in the price (pool, sauna,steam room,unique experience showers,fruit infused water and even dyson hair dryers and swimsuit drier!) amazing drinks,a city view that was beautiful day&night &were offered an extra hour late checkout complimentary aswell which was so kind would definitely reccomend to anyone staying in manchester, everything is within walking distance from the hotel too !"
92,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","I stayed at The Edwardian Radisson, the night before my wedding with bridesmaids and then for 2 nights with my husband. The hotel is superb, spotlessly clean, thoughtful touches, professional and helpful staff. A special mention to Anna who welcomed us and ensured our stay was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble! The hotel with it's stunning architecture was the perfect setting for pre wedding photos. The spa was fabulous for unwinding before and after. I can't rate it highly enough"
93,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel",Been using the Radisson for a few years now and it's an amazing hotel clean friendly and nothing is ever a problem 😁 the staff are really friendly and have always been so welcoming compared to other hotels in the area
94,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","I will try to describe how fabulous this hotel is, we spent two nights there and I have no complaints-the staff are superb especially Barnaby and Gary (gary is hilarious) nothing was too much trouble, breakfast fabulous with amazing service, spa beautiful, rooms gorgeous, the service is second to none-by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in-will defo be back"
95,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","A beautiful hotel with every amenity one could ask for. Staff was gracious, pleasant and became family by the end of our stay. THANK YOU GARY and your amazing concierge team! You’ll forever be a part of our UK family trip memories! Cheers"
96,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Few things to unpack with this visit. First off - the hotel - claiming, and clean. The room was superb. Great black-out blinds. Spacious bathroom. Incredibly clean grout and mastic - a little bit of an obsession of mine. TV in the room was mediocre with minimal channels tuned in and in-house info channels not working. No introduction to hotel amenities on check-in. Room service - quick - great staff. Tasty. On checkout, no invoice was provided despite my asking for a copy to be emailed to me. I noticed higher-than-expected card charges a few days later. Notified hotel I had been charged for multiple breakfasts - despite 7 emails - I was still regularly assured I had consumed all these breakfasts and there was nothing could be done to assist me. I lodged a charge-back request…"
97,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","Booked this hotel as I had to stay overnight in Manchester on return from long haul destination. One of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Rooms spotless , staff very professional and friendly..breakfast delicious. I would highly recommend."
98,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","POSITIVES: - The staff were welcoming, efficient, polite and very accommodating. - The hotel was great for location with many surrounding restaurants, bars, shops and places for entertainment. - The spa facilities were amazing! the atmosphere was very relaxing and it was kept very clean - The bed was very comfortable. - Other guests were friendly. - Around the hotel was kept very clean. NEGATIVES: Not many negatives at all as we were very happy with our stay but if we had to be picky: - The hairdryer in the room is located behind the mirror which slides open, i found it hard to find. The hairdryer was also very cheap and old. There is a dyson hairdryer in the spa which i had to end up using instead. - The tea and coffee selection in the room was very limited. …"
99,"The Edwardian Manchester, A Radisson Collection Hotel","My wife and I stayed at the Edwardian in Manchester on Friday night as part of her thirtieth birthday celebrations. I had previously stayed over for business and enjoyed it so much that I chose to come back with my wife to celebrate her birthday. We have not had a night away together as a couple for over six years since before our first child was born. We now have two children, our eldest son Seth was diagnosed with a form of cancer in August 2021 so the last couple of years have been very tough, our second son Jaxon was born just a few weeks before Seth was diagnosed. I booked the Edwardian for my wife and I as well as various meals and activities at nearby attractions. The warm welcome we received when we checked in was second to none, we were made to feel so welcome. …"
100,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"We had a thoroughly enjoyable 5 night stay at L’Horizon with our room, with its small balcony, providing a magnificent view of St Brelades Bay and beach. Our room was exactly as described and met our requirements perfectly. Breakfast was excellent with a choice of serve yourself buffet but also special hand-picked selections if required. We ate in the hotel most evenings and were very pleased with the food we selected. We like quality food but prefer it not to be too fanciful and it met our requirements exactly. We went in the indoor pool just once (because the weather was so good) and it was very clean and a good temperature for gentle swimming. All the hotel and spa staff were welcoming and attentive without being ‘in your face’. A thoroughly enjoyable stay all around."
101,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"We only used the restaurant, and it was really superb. The terrace setting could not be bettered and the food was top quality. I had the boneless Pork chop and it was excellent, my Wife had the Caesar salad which she enjoyed, but she would have preferred the lettuce leaves to have been sliced rather than just laid on the plate. A really enjoyable evening which we will repeat next year."
102,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Amazing location right on St Brelade beach with the nicest staff ever. The terrace is fabulous. When the tide is high, you feel as if you are sitting on the water. The food is good too. Some of the main rooms are dated but I understand change is on the way but the first-class service makes you quickly forget any negative thoughts."
103,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,Very nice hotel the views are stunning and the staff are amazing. The location is perfect on the right on the gorgeous st Brélades bay beach. What more could you ask for! I would definitely recommend and visits again.
104,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"We were invited to a friend’s wedding at the L’ Horizon Beach Hotel. When I gave my wedding invitation to the travel agents which explained about the wedding and the hotel. My discount code was not applied even though it was clearly stated on the invitation. When it was informed to me by my friend who was getting married I was asked to go back to the travel agents to apply my discount. I was informed by the agent to ask the hotel if they could do this? They said we need to take this up with the travel agent. We got up early that Wednesday morning on the 31/05:23 and travelled all morning, when we arrived in Jersey around 9.30am we were all hungry and asked if we could have breakfast, but were saddened that the manager who was on duty that morning said no. If we wanted…"
105,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"The hotel is clean and bright. The rooms are very clean and cleaned every day. The view is to die for from the hotel. Transport is easy from this hotel the bus stop is right outside the hotel, but best of all was the staff they were simply amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. They treat you like friends which is an unbelievable experience. Not just one or two but all staff. I have never experienced that before where all staff appear to be one happy family. Great hotel thank you L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa."
106,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"First visit to Jersey and so glad we stayed here. Location excellent, staff professional and friendly and very accommodating. Breakfast choice & service very good and the location of the evening meal on the terrace lovely."
107,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Visited the L'Horizon Beach Hotal and Spa for a wedding and stayed for a few days leading up to the wedding. The service and welcome from all the staff was amazing. They made everybody feel part of their family. The hospitality was second to none, nothing was too much trouble and everything was done to please their guests. Everybody I encountered was a credit to the hotel. Keep it up!! Service like this comes with a lot of training and effort please keep up the high standard you have set and maintain that personal touch."
108,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"3 days of absolutely magic and being spoil rotten by the fantastic staff at the hotel. The food was fantastic, the location ideally for a lazy 3 days. We had a ball, and already making plans to come back soon."
109,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"I stayed at L'Horizon for 3 nights from 1st June as I was attending a wedding. Everything was great, but the bedroom was really small, which was a real disappointment. However, the hotel facilities were of a high standard and the staff were really attentive. Housekeeping did a really good job"
110,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Excellent location , lovely hotel, we attended a friends wedding. Lovely greeting on arrival all staff very helpfull nothing was to hard, would highly. The service was good recommend. Truly breath taking"
111,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Staff very welcoming and efficient, hotel great location, good restaurants along promenade and walked to Smugglers Inn one evening. Hotel spa gives easy access to the beach - teenagers enjoyed dipping in sea followed by swimming pool. Very relaxing break."
112,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Our stay was perfect from beginning to end: the view from our balcony / bedroom, the friendly, helpful and attentive staff, wonderful choice at breakfast. Great food in the Grill. The Seafood Sharing Platter at the Terrace was truly incredible in both quality and size."
113,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Wonderful stay. The quality of food, service and facilities was excellent and we felt that this matched what we paid. Throughout the hotel and spa the team of staff working were friendly, professional dressed and very helpful. The spa facilties and treatment were excellent as was our room. The quality of the meals for afternoon tea, dinner and breakfast was excellent with a diverse array of choice and again, very good value for money."
114,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Rooms with a sea view and loungers to relax on a small patio. Lovely fluffy towels, plenty of tea and coffee replenished and the staff at the hotel are fabulous. Breakfast buffet was superb with so much choice. Only negative was thin pillows and an uncomfortable bed."
115,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,The standout things about this hotel is the view of the amazing beach. It’s also right on the beach which is great to be able just to wander out. The new Terrace Bar/Restaurant at the front is great. Staff are incredibly friendly and helpful which sets the tone and atmosphere. Gym and pool are good.
116,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"An excellent hotel and spa facilities, that made a truly magical stay. Will recommend this hotel anytime and every time as the service was great. The staff were excellent and very friendly throughout. Every part of the hotel had friendly professional staff on hand to help or assist ,where required. The location in respect to the beach is probably the best in the area. Links to other parts of the island are easy and the staff are very knowledgeable about giving advice on getting around."
117,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,We had a fabulous stay at L'Horizon to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The staff were all very welcoming and polite. The hotel is kept very clean in both the rooms and communal areas. The sea view room was great coupled with the sunny weather we were fortunate to have all week.
118,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"The service is world class with stunning bay views and in a temperature controlled terrace, enjoying the fresh sea air. The food was always excellent but salads and seafood have even stepped up a notch this year. The prices quite normal for the local market but L’Horizon and staff have to be rated amongst the best I have experienced in a well travelled 5 star hotel/travelled cricket coaching career. Anne, Daniel, Joseph and Alex bring further friendliness and light to this amazing experience. Charles is Night Manager now but he has left his infectious smile amongst the current colleagues on L’Horizon terrace and reception."
119,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,We spent a completely relaxing week surrounded by staff who were always efficient whilst achieving this efficiency with smiling and friendly attention at all times. The food in all restaurants was interesting and varied and well presented.
120,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,The first room I was given had broken toilet seat (which was fixed after I reported it) and musty smell which did not go after several hours with the balcony door and window left open. I asked to be moved. The new room had a faulty fridge which was replaced after I reported it. This isn’t what I expect from a four star hotel. I appreciate that the issues were dealt with once I had reported them but I don’t expect to have to deal with this kind of thing in such a pricey hotel.
121,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Is you book this hotel make sure you pay the extra to have a sea view room. The rooms are maybe not the largest but they are clean and the towels are beautiful and fluffy. The beds are comfy as are the pillows and rooms are turned down for you in the evening which is a nice touch. The staff cannot do enough for you and are always cheery and extremely helpful. Our special thanks to armando who either brought my husband’s sweater back to our room having left it in the restaurant of ran down the corridors after us with the same said sweater. The staff are from al, parts of the world and are extremely interesting to talk to. Our only very slight criticism is that the rooms all have showered over the bath and we would prefer a walk in shower but this was easily rectified by…"
122,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"First class Sunday lunch to celebrate our friend’s birthday. Delicious food served in bright and airy restaurant. The staff were all exceptional and a big shout out to Allison, attentive, courteous with a friendly manner. Thank you for making a great day fantastic!!"
123,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Stayed over a weekend for a friend's wedding reception in May 2023. Lovely location, facilities and effort by the staff to welcome and serve us. Beautiful outside seating area in the sunshine overlooking the St.Brelades beach"
124,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"we have been before and we wil come again! The hotel is in an excellent position, the rooms are comfortable and well maintained, the dining terrace is a joy,excellent food, service and position, all the staff are friendly and efficient. What more can you ask?"
125,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"I’ve been recently for dinner on the Terrace with my boyfriend and his family and would to thank to each staff member that made us feel so welcomed and well looked after. From the beginning Farah welcomed us, Anna was amazing throughout the whole experience, the cocktails from Radomir were lush. Daniel and Alex were very attentive as well. When the food was delivered by Tecla, Chloe and Leonard it has been done with a big smile on their faces and it looks like everyone is happy to be there. Thank you one more time L’horizon team."
126,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Excellent 2 night stay for my husband’s birthday. The Grill room Sunday lunch for 9 people was delicious and the staff amazing, special mention to Alison for her attentiveness and humour. Will definitely return 👏 The view from our room was breathtaking!!"
127,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,Everything about this hotel was utterly faultless! My seaside room was ultra comfortable with the most amazing views over St Brelade's Bay. Everything at the breakfast buffet was fresh and delicious including my poached egg - the first time I've had a perfectly cooked poached egg in a hotel!
128,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,We stayed her for 5 nights in May. Cannot fault anything. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble. All facilities were excellent. Meals in the Grill Room were delicious. We will return.
129,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Myself and 5 friends visited this hotel and it is exceptional. The staff are brilliant. We also visited the spa and the treatments we great.Rooms food, cleanliness all 1st class. We had a wonderful stay and will definitely go back."
130,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"This location is 2nd to none! I very high quality hotel made better by the team who work there! Rooms are spacious, clean and the beds very comfy! Nothing beats the location and views though! Will be going back one day!"
131,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"I stayed at l'horizon on 13 May 23 - 15 May 23 with my daughter..We stayed in a beach front room..it was lovely and the room and ensuite were very nice,we had tea & coffee making facilities and had a sufficient tea and coffee for the time we were there. Plus the staff knocked on your door every night to make sure you had enough tea and coffee. The staff were great,they could not do enough for you from check in housekeeping restaurant and bar. I would highly recommend visiting the hotel and spa.."
132,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Just amazing and wonderful place to celebrate my birthday. Stayed here many times and already booked for next year. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for making our stay tremendous. From arrival to departure was perfect. Lovely staff, beautiful place."
133,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"for me the best hotel in Jersey, services are excellent, and the view is so beautiful. food and drink top quality and you can eat outside when weather permits Also spa and treatments are divine, I had my favourite the Indian head massage, highly recommend this hotel"
134,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Wonderful beach and close to Churchill park. Excellent pleasant walks a cross to ouisane, normoint, portelet and beauport but and has good bus access to rest of island. Great service and quality and overall highly recommended"
135,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Very nice location, typical “English style hotel”, nice breakfast and a very good restaurant “the Grill”, good service A wonderful place for a good exotic disconnection for a nonUK visitor. Large rooms with balcony facing the sea"
136,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,We brought my mum and dad (78 & 81) for a mini break away. The hotel is in the perfect location right on the beach and we literally cannot fault a thing. EVERY member of staff was fabulous knew exactly what they were doing from reception to bar to cleaners all absolutely lovely. Our room was perfect and gorgeous balcony to sit out and wow what a view. Pool and facilities fabulous! Well done L'Horizon you made our stay absolutely amazing we will definitely be back
137,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"To be recommended if you are looking for a quality hotel overlooking the beach. Lovely location, practical parking, bountiful breakfasts, delicious dinners, restful rooms, super staff, Would definitely stay again."
138,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,We stayed in the Beaufort Suite at the westerly corner of the hotel. It has a balcony facing south and west. A separate lounge a large bedroom and a rather small bathroom which does contain both a bath and a separate shower. The food service and location are fantastic. This is a really relaxing place to stay with an excellent spa where I had two massages. The walks around the coast line are stunning.
139,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"I had a wonderful stay with my wife. If you like a beach front hotel, this is for you. It felt like St Brelade's bay was our own personal little paradise, especially since we missed all the crowds of summer. The staff were all lovely and very helpful and prompt to follow up on any requests. For those who like spend time in their hotels rooms, all the beach facing rooms have balconies with seats, there are seats in the rooms too for those who like some room service. And the dvd library at reception was fun to browse, if a little old school (perhaps thats better than accidentally leaving your netflix logged in). The food was good, if a little expensive, though not a huge selection for those not eating meat! Chocolate muffins available at breakfast was a particular highlight (""the…"
140,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"This hotel and location is fantastic. Staff are helpful and friendly. Good bus service right outside the hotel. Things to do on the beach and in the sea kayaking, paddle boards. Unbelievable views from the terrace, where friendly staff are waiting to serve you a drink, lunch or dinner"
141,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,Jersey is a truly wonderful island to visit. You won't find a better beach anywhere else on the island than St Brelades Bay. Staying at L'horizon and looking out over this bay every day is the most perfect of partnerships you will ever find!
142,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Lovely hotel in great setting with wonderful views and facilities. It is made special by the quality and friendliness of all staff. We would return to L’Horizon hotel in a heartbeat, and also found their spa area an added bonus."
143,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"From first arrival to checking out, was made to feel at ease and totally comfortable. The restaurant food and staff both amazing -already looking at booking again Would recommend to family and friends looking for beach views!"
144,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,Beautiful hotel with very comfortable bar area. Sea facing rooms are worth the extra. Excellent food choices for both dinner and breakfast. The hotel staff are all exceptional and go the extra mile for their guests.
145,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"My wife left a lovely review of this wonderful Hotel after our stay but whilst checking out Tripadvisor I felt compelled to look at the poor reviews that this fantastic hotel received to see what that was about. I was curious. I have no connection to this Hotel other than my one stay with my wife and her parents, one of whom now needs a mobility scooter. Between us we have extensive experience of wonderful hotels across the world, including Michelin quality dining, good hearty English fare, and many rather wonderful Cruise line experiences where we have experienced wonderful service. There are just a couple of things you need to know. 1. the service is the best I have ever experienced anywhere. Alyson, Dan and other's I'm actually embarrased I can't recall were brilliant. …"
146,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"We stayed in L’Horizon for 3 nights over the first weekend in May, I cannot recommend the place high enough- easy transparent and informative check in, all meals we had were great and the service levels just exceed expecations. Well done to the whole team and management, excellent place to stay if in Jersey."
147,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Really not happy with the hotel, you pay for a premium service but received far from that. When we arrived at the hotel, we were advised they would take £150 from us paid by card. At the end of the stay, if we spent less than £150 we would be paid the difference, if we spent more, we would pay the difference when we left. On check out at the last day, our total bill was £300. So we expected to make a further payment of £150. But no, the lady demanded we pay £300 and the previous £150 was just held, and would be refunded 2 days later. We paid. Its now 5 days later and no refund, having to spend time calling the hotel again chasing this money. They have no idea how long its going to take to get our money back. For a premium hotel this is ridiculous. Dreadful service. 2718218297"
148,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,We stayed here for 4-nights and the location of the hotel is fabulous with amazing views over the beach - definitely worth upgrading to a sea view room. Staff were all very friendly and attentive and made you feel very welcome. The room was spacious and very comfortable and breakfast was delicious. Overall we would definitely recommend L'Horizon.
149,L'Horizon Beach Hotel & Spa,"Having lived in the Island for 40 years I did not expect this kind of hospitality ! We were unable to go on the original date due as Condor Ferry from France (Where we now live) was cancelled due to high winds and very rough weather,So we were only able to have the worst room at the Hotel as punishment for not turning up on the due date .The room we booked was still available according to their on- line booking system. booking on line service"
150,Big Blue Hotel,The room was very comfortable. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. The food in the restaurant extremely tasty and good value for money. Ample parking at a fraction of the cost of on street parking.
151,Big Blue Hotel,Shocking service by the staff. We’re quite happy to leave a 7 year old crying rather than trying to help. No empathy what so ever. We normally use this hotel quite regularly however we will not be returning.
152,Big Blue Hotel,Check in took longer than expected. We arrived at 1am after a gig and instantly was charged for the room and also asked for £18 to park our car. Was told at check in that check out was 11 and I pointed out I had late check out and still our door got chapped at 11.25am to say check out was 11. Once again I pointed out we had late check out. The men apologised but I didn't feel it was quite enough.
153,Big Blue Hotel,"First as always ,the honesty part. Myself and my wife work for one if the world's largest hotel group with many hundreds of hotels in the UK over several brands and ratings . We both work in an economy location in Cumbria with almost 40 years service between us my wife does f and b as well as reception I am permanent week end night audit. On arrival the building looks well kept ,reception is very nice a small queue on arrival one receptionist definitely much quicker than the other ,we got the quick one. Had booked DBL room got a massive family room with a DBL ,sgl and kids bunkbeds the bunks are in a separate are with its own tv and games console. Large TV Freeview channels ,we found the wi fi a bit hit and miss but that not unusual ,same in our place. Air con/ cooling worked…"
154,Big Blue Hotel,"The family bedroom provided is not fit for purpose. It has 5ft bunk bed and would not fit the height of our children. Manager refused to find alternative and asked that we look for another hotel. We sought another hotel following the advice, but the manager then refused to refund our booking fee. She was also laughing despite the dilemma until called to order. She failed to accept that the bunk bed supplied is not fit for purpose despite being too short. Eventually she sort out a folding bed since we refused to leave the property and put the blame on the front desk officer as being inexperienced despite being at the forefront dealing with the issue in a very unprofessional way."
155,Big Blue Hotel,"Stayed here quite a few times as it is in an excellent location for the Pleasure Beach, and there is also a tram stop across the road which takes you all along the golden mile. The hotel is great value for money, especially on the 4 nights for 3 B&b rate. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are great and very clean."
156,Big Blue Hotel,"The suite and amenities were lovely, very clean and well maintained. Food was great, helpfull staff, altogether a great break away. We will be back for another relaxing break, possibly going to try when the illuminations are on."
157,Big Blue Hotel,"Overall it’s a great experience, my daughter Genesha George really liked the hotel and also she left a message note for the hotel . Hi Big Blue Love you. If I really wanted to give some advice or opinion , regarding the breakfast the food is little bit oily and soggy. You could also consider the customer health aspects. Kind regards Mrs.S.George"
158,Big Blue Hotel,Brakfast is a min choice not much options.. eggs bacon beans ect Can only enter the theme park but can’t exit unless walking down the bottom of the park .. Dinner options are ok and so is bar food but tbh it is expensive
159,Big Blue Hotel,"Absolutely perfect for Pleasure Beach. All the staff were polite, cheerful and more than willing to go above and beyond. We received a free upgrade to a family room and were allowed to check in early !!!! Within 5 minutes, we had our tickets to the park and were ready to go in. The room was fantastic. The only things we would change were the breakfast (ours was a bit grim, but we were some of the last stragglers) and that the TV was a bit small. We will definitely be back."
160,Big Blue Hotel,What a fantastic hotel loved the VIP entrance into the theme park and the rooms were perfect for for our family of five wouldn’t stay anywhere else from now on and must say the breakfast was also spot on ❤️👍
161,Big Blue Hotel,Stayed in family room as always with pleasure beach view. Food amazing- both at breakfast and at evening. Staff all very friendly. Able to get into the pleasure beach via the hotel so no queue. Will be back.
162,Big Blue Hotel,"Only a brief visit but would definitely recommend. Nice and clean, friendly staff, decent breakfast would be good for kids before a day out, great location for the pleasure beach. I thought it maybe noisy from the pleasure beach but was fine."
163,Big Blue Hotel,Kids bunk beds ok for small children but if they are over 4ft way too small. Restaurant is very poor kids pizzas looked like frozen £2 specials from Asda We wont be returning to the Big Blue Hotel. We have stayed here before and it was very good. Not any more
164,Big Blue Hotel,"1st night, great first impression! Checked in early. Room is amazing. Kids room has bunk beds, a PlayStation and 2 tv’s !!!! Main room is spacious. Even has hot chocolate sachets which for me is a must have !!!!! Great location. Staff are amazing. Bar is perfect."
165,Big Blue Hotel,Meeting friends for the weekend and we decided to book the hotel having never stayed before. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a suite. It was an incredible room with a view over the Pleasure Beach. Spacious and very comfortable - faultless. Good breakfast and they were able to cater for my partner who is gluten free. Will definitely stay here again and will always be the number 1 choice when visiting the area.
166,Big Blue Hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel quite a lot before covid , it was once the best hotel in Blackpool. Room facilities perfect. Restaurant breakfast standards have changed and not for the better. Restaurant was dirty. Asked for knife was brought a dirty one. Glasses not clean as was some mugs.very Limited selection. Cold bacon and eggs Floor sticky Food tongs stuck up Previous stays they served everything under the sun. Staff didn't no which milk was which. Allergy awareness is shocking. I will never return to this hotel and if you want a good breakfast and clean Restaurant book elsewhere. Staff and managers didn't care in the slightest when feedback was provided."
167,Big Blue Hotel,"Visited Blackpool with the family and did the “2 night stay with breakfast + one day pleasure beach ticket” deal from the website. We stayed Wednesday-Friday during the Witsun Week Half Term. We managed to get a space on the hotel car park, although we were warned at busier times we may have struggled and would have had to find somewhere else. Parking each night for your stay is £10 and lasts till 12pm to allow check out and packing the car away before departure. The staff were really helpful and friendly, always had a smile on their face when you saw them too. The hotel is on the beach front, close by to local shops and restaurants and is a part of the pleasure beach itself so you can access the VIP entrance 15 minutes before anyone else to start lining up at the rides.…"
168,Big Blue Hotel,"Big Blue hotel was welcoming and friendly staff. Room was clean and roomy, but very like premier inn,nothing special. Plenty of choice for breakfast, but for myself being Gluten free it was a let down. Asled for gf sausage, 20 mins later I asked again and the member of staff said I hadn't ordered them, and when I challenged this shrugged her shoulders. Got toast though. Second morning, asked again, got sausage, not cooked through and gf toast was just warm bread. The table we were put on was in the middle of the conservatory and the floorboards moved s people walked past, causing the table to move. My boys are autistic and it was nt the best place to sit. The night previous we sat in the bar. Had a quiet drink, the one staff member, behind the till was chewing gum while talking…"
169,Big Blue Hotel,We enjoyed our stay.. but I do think that for the price of the rooms.. that the bedrooms could be doing with a little upgrade. They are very tired looking. Restaurant staff let the hotel down a bit by not serving us dinner as we hadn't pre booked
170,Big Blue Hotel,"Very polite, respectful and pleasant staff and experience. Rooms are amazing very clean and offer options for children such as games and electronics. Food and drink options are great and reasonably priced. Booking was easy and quick."
171,Big Blue Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, very clean, friendly staff, lovely room with great amenities, all mod cons. The hotel is located right by pleasure beach and a tram stop so very convenient for everything! The parking was £10 per night but totally worth it. We found the restaurant a bit pricy but food & cocktails were lovely."
172,Big Blue Hotel,"Two nights, B&B, an evening meal and tickets to the Pleasure Beach all for about £150 each and on a bank holiday weekend - the value is EXCELLENT. You pretty much walk straight into the park as well. Rooms were clean and lovely, staff great. Food wasn't much but didn't expect to be so not a major. I went with friends but lots of couples/families. I would really recommend this and their packages to anyone"
173,Big Blue Hotel,Great location for the pleasure beach me and my 3 1/2 year old daughter stayed the long weekend she and I loved it . Food great and staff were great too . And was upgraded to a deluxe double room without asking . Amazing
174,Big Blue Hotel,"Really good service. Restaurant food was excellent. We have stayed at the big blue many times, always with good service and value for money. Like the rooms that overlook the pleasure Beach. Can't think of any negatives about this hotel."
175,Big Blue Hotel,Have stayed here many times and have never been disappointed.well trained friendly staff who always make our stay special. Good food for evening meal and superb breakfast with loads of choice to start the day off well.
176,Big Blue Hotel,Recently booked a deluxe family room for myself partner and 2 kids . . Room was spacious and well laid out . Carpet felt a touch tacky so keep the socks or slippers on . That aside only slight grumble would be lack of a small fridge or mini bar . Hotel overall was very decent and food very good . Wide selection at breakfast and a nice menu for evening meals . Giving the shambles of the surrounding area we felt safe and comfortable in pleasant atmosphere for a few drinks and food . Staff all very good as well.
177,Big Blue Hotel,"Clean and comfortable hotel ,breakfast was lovely plenty to choose from and we also reserved a table for a evening meal which was excellent the steak was done perfectly 10/10 ,would definitely recommend, staying at the Big Blue hotel it is also right next to the theme park"
178,Big Blue Hotel,"We had a one night stay at the Big Blue on Saturday the 20th of May. Yet again we weren't let down, it's one of our favourite hotels anywhere, the food, the room, the staff and hotel ambiance and cleanliness were all so very good."
179,Big Blue Hotel,"Staff very friendly, polite, very very helpful throughout my stay. Food was excellent for breakfast and dinner. I was in the accessible room which was perfect for my needs couldn't have had a better stay anywhere else"
180,Big Blue Hotel,"Firstly I would like address the Travelodge comment, don’t know which Travelodge the person was referring to but would like to say that the statement is very harsh and in our opinion uncalled for. We love staying at the Big Blue as we done on many occasions and always our preferred choice when coming to Blackpool. In fact thats the only reason we come Blackpool. Also a bit confused about the parking charges, as we were charged £10 per night which we paid on our last visit so not gone up since we visited in 2021. I know everyone is allowed their own opinion but a lot of the time it only takes a little hiccup and it gets made into a drama!!! When really they should talk to the staff and try and address the issue instead of sounding off on here. Out stay here as been no…"
181,Big Blue Hotel,Over rated property even the parking is expensive it’s trying to be a top end market which it is but the clientele it’s allowing is letting it down wouldn’t stay there again I prefer other hotels within the area
182,Big Blue Hotel,Stayed in 421. Great view of the park. Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Loved the buffet breakfast. Fitness room is small but very well equipped. Great hotel! Perfectly placed for the tram stop. Plenty of parking available 👌
183,Big Blue Hotel,Lovely size room only thing missing was a fridge which later on we was told we could have asked for one free of charge so will remember that for next time I think the parking is expensive £18 a night when we could parked on the road for free and room service you pay an extra 7.50 just for them too bring it too your room and I’m not too keen on the shower as the floor gets soaked but sleep was was perfect and so quite the staff are very polite
184,Big Blue Hotel,"Was a nice time away for the long Bank Holiday weekend enjoyed the stay was good quality hotel and decent for the price we paid and service was good,restocked our room good and cleaned up very well,the instructions for the room were very simple too overall happy with the whole thing"
185,Big Blue Hotel,"nice clean beautiful hotel, easy location nice food always willing to help. family rooms are nice. warm welcoming reception fresh fruit available. bit expensive for one bedroom and confusing when trying to book one room but nothing major"
186,Big Blue Hotel,Loved this hotel beautiful room n service..our room dint have working aircon which being an older lady was essential for me but reception moved us to a room overlooking themepark with air con and juliet balcony no extra cost..only downfall is having to pay extra £18 to park on hotel carpark after £150 a night for room it should be free
187,Big Blue Hotel,"The hotel is well located right next to the Pleasure beach. The rides were outside our room but thanks to double glazing not a problem. Our room was spacious, clean and bed was very comfortable We booked 2 nights B&B over the Bank Holiday A bit pricey at Bank Holiday prices Breakfast was buffet style on Sunday morning, very tasty with good quality ingredients Monday was waiter service and again was very nice. Staff are very friendly and efficient at their jobs I would definitely use this hotel again"
188,Big Blue Hotel,"Spent two weeks here while working at Blackpool. Had a superior room(332) overlooking the theme park, lovely room, big comfy room, double doors letting you look over the park. Room was kept spotless by housekeeping. Parking is on site at an additional 18 quid per day. Had one evening meal here, food was nice but expensive. Breakfast was good. Every member of staff I interacted with was bright and cheery and made you welcome. I am due back for work in October and will definitely be back. Thanks."
189,Big Blue Hotel,"The menu for kids is very disappointing, if your children only eat chips with sausages or the other usual lazy kids menu options you’ll be fine. If you want anything else it’s going to cost you to order from the other menus."
190,Big Blue Hotel,Only hotel I stay in every time I stay in Blackpool. Very good breakfast! I always recommend and have visited many times with different people every time and they all say the same and would stay there again
191,Big Blue Hotel,"This room was not a value for money, was charged incorrectly, room was dated and toilet dident flush correctly, I have always wanted to stay in this hotel, I have been coming to Blackpool for 40 years, and was disappointed to find this hotel not up to our expectations"
192,Big Blue Hotel,From the moment we arrived till the moment we left was a great experience. Staff were very polite and friendly. Food in the restaurant was delicious and great menu. Breakfast buffet was also good. We will definitely stay again.
193,Big Blue Hotel,Bang average hotel at the very bottom of the promenade. Hotel on par with premier inn but double the price. Hotel was clean enough and staff were nice. Breakfast was really good and plenty of it. Reviewed as a 3 due to the EV charge points. No attempt made to mark the bays and will allow anyone to park in them. It’s like they encourage it to save people charging their cars. Car park had plenty of spaces and but because it’s closer to the entrance people just park next to the EV charger. £18 per night per car is also a complete money spinner. Shocking that you have to pay even more to stay at the hotel. Next time we will stay elsewhere due to the inconvenience and extra car park charges
194,Big Blue Hotel,Exceeded expectation. Our room was great. Even overlooked the park. It was my partners birthday and he is a rollover coaster geek lol. So he loved the view from our balcony doors. Staff were attentive and super friendly. Breakfast was really good. well organised and a great choice. We ate once in the restaurant and again the food was very good and service was brilliant . Thank you Big blue you made our visit memorable
195,Big Blue Hotel,Great Hotel only downside is that the rooms need a bit of a refresh. Clean and tidy just a bit tired now. Staff are really friendly and very helpful. Food was excellent as well. I wouldn't have any hesitation in staying again.
196,Big Blue Hotel,"A very nice hotel and very good location, along side the Park, friendly staff and very clean. Excellent breakfasts. This was our second visit and we will hope to return in the future.Excellent facilities and lay out of the Hotel"
197,Big Blue Hotel,I am a disabled pensioner with cancer and have to use a mobility scooter entering and parking my wheelchair accessible vehicle was very easy and all the staff were very helpful. I know I can rely on The Big Blue
198,Big Blue Hotel,Great hotel and fab location. Booked the room with pleasure beach tickets which saved a good amount on entry. Clean room and well set out plenty space and clean facilities. Pull out bed could have been better quality but main bed was good.
199,Big Blue Hotel,"The children loved the PlayStations and I loved the bed in the family delux room. The bed was so comfortable, I want to buy one . I enjoyed the buffet breakfast but after reserving the 10am slot, we found that shortly after, the buffet area was getting cleared away. There wasn't any fruit left , so go to breakfast early! My daughter and friend had a another room and it looked like a cosy studio apartment."
200,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Location good. Parking in Charlotte street easy & not far to walk. £35 for 48 hrs. Room spacious & modern. Very comfortable. Lovely touch with Oliver the duck & pillow spray. We used the hotel bar which was nice, seating not that comfy but modern! Restaurant looked modern but we didn’t eat there. Location is perfect for exploring bath. We asked for a quiet room & got it. View of flats next door was the trade off but we looked at the city all day! Only issue we had was housekeeping- our room was not ‘serviced’ just tea/coffee filled up on day 2. Bed not made etc (the usual hotel housekeeping) Lady on reception was helpful & surprised this wasn’t done. She was lovely actually. Housekeeping lady said they don’t do it? So if returning to a nice bed made room is important then its…"
201,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"This is a well-located modern hotel within easy reach of all the tourist hotspots. The rooms are pleasant enough, and quiet, with comfortable beds. So far so good. BUT... Breakfast was more than a disaster. First, there are options where you can have cooked breakfast and continental. Or just cooked. Or just one item (like a Rice Krispie presumably). There isn't an option for just continental. It's just plain nuts... or a way to screw your customers out of a few extra quid. We made the mistake of asking for cooked and continental. Big mistake. I ordered scrambled eggs on toast. First, I believe that butter is supposed to be involved. First, in the eggs to stop them solidifying. Second, on the toast. No butter met it's end here. The eggs were positively dry and solid, and the…"
202,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Great city centre location. We loved the pool and spa which made our stay in Bath extra special. Staff are extremely helpful, friendly and guest focused. The family room was spacious, spotless with modern decor. Beds were very comfortable and great quality bedding. The breakfast is 5*, good selection from the a la carte as well as a buffet and continental selection. Recommend 100%."
203,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Everything was great would recomend and go back. Central locaiton, very clean, excellent sauna and swimming pool, very tasty food at breakfast. Firendly staff, especially Will at reception. Can't wait to visit again."
204,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"I visited Bath as a trip for my bucket list and chose a nicer hotel than I would normally go for. I loved the Apex as soon as I arrived. The supreme room was light and lots of little extras to make the stay comfortable : lovely toiletries, lavender pillow mist, coffee machine, pen and notepaper, a fridge and a fluffy big bath towel. The bed was king size and comfortable and the air conditioning meant I could keep the room just right for me. I ate in my room twice and the wait wasn't more than 15 minutes. My only comment on the food is that it relied heavily on onions and chutney. If you don't like these, there's no alternatives. I was a little surprised to see that house keeping had made the bed with the TV remote control under the duvet, but otherwise they did a good job at…"
205,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"The location is good, at the edge between the rebuilt and old parts of Bath. The staff is friendly. For Americans, be aware that this hotel’s idea of coffee making in the room is a tea pot and instant. On pne of pur 3 days, housekeeping started but did not finish taking care of our room - towels changed, beds not made, for example. The room was clean and quiet, and the beds comfortable. Breakfast was off the menu 2 days but a very unsatisfactory (few choices) buffet n Saturday. Overall, acceptable but not excellent."
206,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"The hotel is lovely, nice reception with plenty of staff when we arrived. We stayed in room 125 which was really nice, clean and the most comfortable bed ever. It does overlook the main road but this didn’t cause us any issues with sleep. Breakfast was fantastic once we realised to ask for the additional breakfast menu. It would be useful if these were already on the table as it was only by seeing other guests orders did we realise there were other options besides the hot & cold buffet. We went to breakfast at 9:40 on Friday (breakfast ends at 10) and everything was still being topped up to ensure all items were available. There have been many hotels we’ve stayed at where this hasn’t been the case so this was nice to see. Every member of staff we’ve encountered have all been…"
207,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Apex City Bath’s location is truly central with food accessible just outside your door. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Family room was clean and turned down daily. A 5 min walk to the Roman Bath and Bath Abbey. Great staff! Central location! Thank you Apex city bath for a wonderful experience!
208,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Handy location, nicely decorated, calm professional environment, rate included use of lovely indoor pool with jets, sauna, steam, small gym (take your own flip flops) - loved that!! Smart looking room/hotel, good space in room, modern bathroom, good service, easy location. Would highly recommend and likely to return if I go back to Bath! Only comment was unsupportive pillows (trying 1 or 2), reducing comfort & quality of sleep to be honest, so if that was remedied I think it would make a big difference, and disturbed with some noise from outside (some bangs once from outside, and one morning from bins outside?, and one night/morning from something large falling upstairs?, not from rowdy people in street or anything I don't think) despite being put in quietest side of internal…"
209,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Booked a twin room online and was better than the photo, whilst basic for a 4 star hotel, it was very clean and staff were super friendly in a genuine manner. My room was not ready upon arrival, I did arrive on a Sunday before the busy bank holiday Monday, but they offered my child and I a complimentary drink at the bar whilst we waited, and got the room within 30mins. The hotel is located just off the edge of the town centre, but a brisk 5min stroll and you're into the beautify of Bath. Shops, restuarants and shopping is just a stone's throw away; bus station just across the road providing access. We came by national express, and it was a 10mins walk from the terminus. The only thing I would say which could be improved was providing slipper and a tooth brush."
210,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"A very nice hotel, with good facilities (pool, sauna, steam room) and located right in the heart of the city centre. Easy walking distance to just about anything in central Bath. The rooms are clean and comfortable, though the noise of doors closing in neighbouring rooms (all rooms are very close together) may disturb occassionally. While we didn't have time to make use of it, there is a bar and reasonably priced restaurant at the hotel too. Overall, a very nice stay and would certainly consider staying again when next in Bath."
211,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"The building is well designed, responding contextually to its site. In lieu of rustication round floor piers of bath stone form a colonnade with large sheets of glass between, giving and active frontage and street interaction at this important corner location. Whilst monolithic in material, a simple horizontal corbel separates the ‘podium’ this from the first and second floors, the fenestration is classically proportioned and arranged onto a strong grid that wraps seamlessly around the façade. The upper window is a diminished height, giving authenticity to the arrangement of maximising light at the lower levels of a narrow Georgian street. The uppermost storey is a mansard form with attractive balconies stepping the building back from the main face as a sleek glass face. All in…"
212,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Overall a nice stay. Was very busy on arrival and waited in the queue around 20 mins before being seen to check in. Spa facilities are a bonus and were well maintained, alot of spas I go to tend to have so much chlorine in the water, this is the first one where I didn't stink of chlorine after. Room was big and clean."
213,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Good facilities and nice to have a swimming poool in the centre. A very short walk to all you need but not in a noisy area. All you need for a stay in Bath for business or pleasure. Parking a short walk away.
214,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"The hotel is perfectly located within a 2 minute walk of the within the shopping / restaurant area. The communal areas were as was our room, which we able to check in to earlier as our room was ready (1:30pm when the confirmation email stated 3:30pm). We booked our slot at the pool / sauna / steam room on arrival for 4-5pm with no issues and the facilities were immaculate. Staff were all friendly on arrival and departure. We didn’t eat at the hotel due to preferring to eat out."
215,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Beautiful hotel with gorgeous food but if you want a good nights sleep then check the conference room is not booked. We spent two nights in Bath to review universities and we were on the 1st floor room 161 above the function room. Went to bed at 10 and all hell broke - the loudest, thumping music I ever heard. I rang and complained and was told it would end around 11.30-12.00 which it did but not a chance of sleeping whilst it was happening. I mentioned it on the Saturday and asked why we were put above it, she said the hotel is fully booked which wasn’t true as the night before we were told you don’t need to book restaurant or pool as it’s quiet? Then to top it all they posted a note in the lift saying it was happening again on the Saturday night. If I had booked a cheap hotel…"
216,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Fantastic Hotel. Near everything that you need. Bed very large and comfortable. The rooms have anything. Only thing You need a sign to say milk and water in fridge below kettle. I thought the cleaner had forgotten to leave the milk pods. On that note. I spoke to the cleaner at the pool and told her. The hotel and pool area included has been the cleanest I have ever stayed in. So 3 cheers for the cleaners. Who are often forgotten about
217,Apex City of Bath Hotel,I stay a few times a year for work and always love coming back. Friendly staff who are very helpful when I need to change my room. Relaxing pool and spa. Great gym and fab work space in reception. Will be coming back soon.
218,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Very comfortable large rooms. Would stay again if coming to Bath. Second time at this hotel as our experience was good.Good location and good facilities. Continues to be our Bath hotel of choice when offers are available.
219,Apex City of Bath Hotel,First class hotel staff are amazing. clean and tidy. beds are very comfortable breakfast is lovely cooked fresh would definitely come back for a third stay. Very handy for the city centre. Love Bath x
220,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"My wife and I booked an overnight stay as we were travelling to Bath to visit a sick friend. We were impressed by the helpful staff and the availability of ""Blue Badge"" parking next to the hotel. Our room was very comfortable and clean with all the necessary facilities. We had breakfast and dinner both of which were excellent. There was a minor dispute over the cost of the dinner which, hopefully, will be resolved shortly. Overall, a highly recommended experience."
221,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"We love this hotel - rooms are luxurious and the pool and spa area is an added bonus. We arrived early but our room was ready, giving us more value for money. Very central for visiting Bath and the reception area is a great meeting point."
222,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Great hotel in a good location, close to city centre. Loads of shops, restaurants and bars nearby. Our room was clean and very comfortable. Good tea and coffee facilities as well as a fridge. My only complaint about the room was the air conditioning wasn’t great, it kept turning off. The room got hot very quickly. The gym is small but well equipped with good machinery and it’s very clean. The spa facilities were really good too. Overall with its excellent facilities this hotel is great value for money. I would’ve given 5 stars were it not for the poor air conditioning."
223,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Came to bath for a spa weekend and the hotel was a nice extension of the great time I had. Would definitely stay here again if or when I come back to Bath. Only let down by the cold breakfast. Didn't mention it to staff so can't grumble to much.
224,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Visited Bath for the weekend and booked a balcony room for the Saturday night. The room, service and facilities in the hotel were very good and I would highly recommend. One word of warning, there are a couple of lively bars opposite and the noise created was a major issue. I would have expected the sound proofing to be better as this was also an issue with constantly hearing internal doors banging and people talking in the corridors. If you are coming on the weekend and not planning to be in the bars opposite, I’d probably recommend booking elsewhere. Everything else was excellent."
225,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Stayed here 6 times is a nice hotel and good location. This last trip was highest room rate paid and least great room. Was a first time booking as Insider Loyalty programme and this was very underwhelming no upgrade offered and received a chase call from receptionist when supposed to have extra hour with the room. If book again I’ll use my usual booking app instead.
226,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"The worst hotel experience. Room service was not provided; No clean room and bathroom. When we complained they brought clean sheets and ask us to change them ourselves. The bathroom remained dirty and no clean towels, cups, or toilet paper was provided."
227,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"We visited Bath for a couple days away and this hotel was in the perfect location for easily getting to and from the train station and to the town centre. It was stylish and modern and very spacious. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and even checked us in a few hours early which meant we could carry on with our day without having to come back later and check in or collect our bags from reception. Overall, we loved this hotel and will definitely be coming back here."
228,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Stayed here for 3 nights. Friendly staff. Comfortable bed. Lovely bathroom. Freshly cooked breakfast. My wife enjoyed the Pool and Steam Room a couple of mornings. Reasonably priced bar. Only downside storage space in the room for clothes.
229,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Pros: Hotel was modern Breakfast was nice with lots of choice Rooms were modern and beds were large Cons: Phoned for fresh milk as there was a sign in the room saying this was complementary. We were brought 3 sachets of uht milk between 2 people. No water in room, phoned down for some and was brought one very small bottle. We weren’t asked how our stay was when checking out. Overall: Nice hotel and rooms but service not what I would have expected for the price."
230,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, good central location, let down by an unfortunate issue with the shower. I'd suggest that they implement regular checks for this type of thing rather than leaving this discovery for guests."
231,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"My partner and I booked the best of bath deal that the hotel offer, this was great and included nearly everything that we wanted to do at bath. We felt the deal was well worth the money! The staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, they made breakfast and dinner easy. Bath was beautiful, we loved it! The hotel was easy walking distance to everything. We recommend booking the Roman baths."
232,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Good location and staff were friendly yet the room was dirty and really needed a deep clean. Breakfast was poor and overpriced. We originally booked this hotel as they offered a spa break, with a food & drink’s voucher & a 3 course meal one of the nights of your stay. Which we then found out that the spa was fully booked so changed it to just bed & breakfast. I think after trying their breakfast we had a lucky escape and you can always book the spa separately as it is not on the premises"
233,Apex City of Bath Hotel,We stayed here for our wedding and everything was amazing from the welcome on arrival to the departure. We will most certainly be back. The kids loved the pool too. We went for breakfast and my daughter didn't want black pudding so was offered extra sausage and a plate of hashbrowns and was so happy. Thank you for making our stay so good.
234,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"This was a wonderful hotel- friendly staff, clean, comfortable room, nice dining room and location was just what we needed. Our bed had extra pillows and was very comfortable. Loved the products provided. The lobby was large and also comfortable"
235,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Booked this hotel as I had a business meeting in Bath. My husband hi-jacked my trip for leisure! Fabulous choice of hotel. Room was amazingly clean and modern. Bed was comfortable. My husband used the leisure facilities and hasn't stopped talking about how lovely and clean the leisure area was. He used the pool, sauna and steam room. We will definitely be returning to this hotel in July for our wedding anniversary. The location was perfect! Thanks for a great trip!"
236,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Lovely weekend in a good location of bath. The hotel was nice and staff were very friendly and helpful. We didn't spend loads of time in the hotel but did book it because of the facilities which we were keen to use. Was the week after easter so lots of families and children in the hotel. The spa and pool facilities were nice but had to book an hour slot and all times we went it was very busy and lots of loud children which was less relaxing. Not the hotels fault but something to think about if booking. would recomend.
237,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights with my husband. First time we have been to Bath. Lovely large reception area with welcoming staff. Room was large and spacious had lots of amenities including complimentary water in fridge changed daily, hair dryer, iron. Large bed which is really comfy. Spacious bathroom. The hotel is less than a 5 minute walk into Bath town itself. The pool and sauna/steam room is of a good size and is bookable for 1hr at a time. We used this on the day of checkout and there were changing facilities to use afterwards and we could store our luggage in the lobby. The nearest car park was Charlotte street which is 10min walk. We visited the thermal spa which is less than a 10min walk from the hotel and recommend this and the Roman baths. We didn’t eat or drink at the…"
238,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Only stayed one night but was impressed with the hotel and team. The team were especially friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the beds were good. The rooms had usb sockets and iron and ironing board. The hotel is in a great location so handy for bars, restaurants and shopping"
239,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Staff were friendly and helpful The bar area was nice The rooms were clean and tidy with spacious bathrooms Good central location, easy to reach main attractions in Bath Leisure facilities were good, we enjoyed the pool, sauna, and steam room"
240,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Bar staff not friendly and didn’t provide any service and closed bar after taking order and not providing drinks. Good location, nice breakfast but terrible coffee! Pool, steam and sauna are nice and relaxing."
241,Apex City of Bath Hotel,We have stayed in quite a few hotels in Bath over the last couple of years and the Apex has been the best. The room and bathroom fittings are of a high quality an aesthetically pleasing - some good interior design here. (Okay I really don't need all the cushions.) The same can be said of the rest of the hotel to - nicely designed. Staff were efficient and helpful too.
242,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Really lovely hotel, twin room was so much better than other chain hotels I have stayed in, two king size beds really comfortable lots of super soft pillows. Swimming pool was really good, didn't use the sauna or steam room as not our thing. Ideal place to stay as walking distance to all the shops and restaurants. Staff were really helpful."
243,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"I have stayed in this hotel several times when meeting my friend in Bath. I had paid for this hotel in advance as per policy. I was emailed by them to say that I had not paid. I confirmed that I had and had evidence of bank transfer from bacs. I was informed that I would be contacted by staff agin if there was a problem with locating payment. . However When I arrived a the Hotel I was again informed that I had not paid. Again I stated that I had evidence of the transactions. The Hotel had not contacted me in advance of checking in if there had been a problem with unresolved payment issues. On arrival I was too tired to discuss it further and it was agreed that I would discuss this the next morning, which I did. This caused me a great deal of stress as I did not have the…"
244,Apex City of Bath Hotel,The hotel and staff are wonderful. The rooms were very hot and stuffy with regulated a/c that was much too warm. Very bad for sleeping. The rooms were well planned as far as outlets and furniture.. would come again if a/c issue was fixed.
245,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Great value for money, fab location, walking distance just 10 minutes to everywhere we need.staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms spacious and comfortable.Great pool, steam room and sauna. Bar reasonably priced."
246,Apex City of Bath Hotel,Just returned from another wonderful stay at the Apex Bath the staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble great food wonderful spa and room excellent with walk in shower a great help.Special mention to the two ladies in the restaurant on Monday night and to Katherline in reception and also milley in the bar.We wil be returning very soon highly recommended.
247,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Would not stay there again and we come to Bath loads to visit my partners lad in Uni. The Check in spoilt our stay as we first tried to check in before 15:00hrs and they wouldn’t let us, so we left our bags with them. When we called back the queue was longer than rids at a Theme park, so I used the online booking. That was pointless as after completing it, I went back up the front of the queue at the check in desk and the guy was so rude behind the reception desk. All I asked him was where do I queue after check in online, after I asked him the for 2nd time he said at the back of the queue. Well pointless check in online. Thanks but wont stay there again."
248,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Great hotel,great location,great room,great facilities and great staff (especially the guy on reception who looks like Peter Draws). We will definitely be back next time we are in Bath,highly recommended."
249,Apex City of Bath Hotel,"Brilliant service, fantastic front of house Megan at reception was terrific and brilliant breakfast with plenty of choice turn over of food was very regular, and replaced very quickly, rooms were spotless, and beds were very comfortable"
250,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Lovely 3 nights stay with my 2 daughters in a triple room. No complaints at all. Every member of staff from front desk, bar staff, breakfast staff all so nice, friendly and helpful. Our first visit to Scotland and made feel so welcome wherever we went in Edinburgh. Bus stop directly outside was so easy to get in to city centre for tram access. Will definitely stay here again if ever back in Edinburgh."
251,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Hotel was so helpful and supportive. As an entrant to Edinburgh Marathon they offer early breakfast, the chance to book a minibus to the start line ( at an additional cost) and staff were professional, very helpful and welcoming. Excellent service, clean comfortable room and great location for marathon runners. Would recommend to anyone visiting Edinburgh as bus stop outside to get into the city centre and also has a pool/ gym to use which was great."
252,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,We have just had 4 nights here for the first time in over 3 years. Our room this visit was more spacious than last visit and was very clean and the bed comfortable. Ample parking and good wifi. The bonus for us was the use of gym and pool. The pool is 20 metres with a couple of dedicated lap lanes so you could have a proper swim. Location is also great for walking into Portobello and Musselburgh or catch the bus into Edinburgh. All staff were friendly and efficient too. Overall a great stay and would definitely use again and can recommend.
253,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,Great hotel with helpful friendly staff. They even decorated my room for my other half’s 30th birthday with balloons and banners which was a lovely extra touch :) will definitely recommend to friends and family !
254,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"I chose this hotel for the majority of our first trip to Europe for a number of reasons - value. proximity to public transportation, previous reviews, and ability to leave bulk of our luggage with them while on a five-day, four-night tour of the Highlands. We could not have made a better choice for us. The service by the entire staff was incredible (and as we found out while wandering around Edinburgh and Scotland a Scottish trait). I booked our air travel and hotel together via Delta Vacations - this was one of the less expensive choices (largely due, I think to being a few miles from the city center). We arrived very early on the day we were scheduled to check in and were pleased to be able to check in right away. As mentioned, service was great, especially at Reception. …"
255,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Nice hotel clearly busy with tourists to Scotland/Edinburgh. The staff were friendly and helpful, very happy to accommodate our E-bikes in a secure place for charging. Easy access to city centre by bus and short walk to portobello promenade and beach."
256,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Everything at this hotel was spot on, lovely staff, nice rooms, the food was excellent (evening meal and breakfast) and fairly priced, pool facilities clean and enjoyable. The customer service at every point was second to none. One of the best overall hotel stays for a long time. Will definitely be back."
257,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"I was extremely impressed by this hotel, lovely welcome at reception, detailed travel help, clean and quiet room with everything I needed, well organised, tasty breakfast, lovely pool. I felt very at home and have already booked to return."
258,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"This property is a GEM! They go far beyond the standards that we have come to expect from Best Western. Let me compliment the front desk staff first. James - I believe seems to be the manager. He was extremely helpful in a restaurant recommendation and went beyond to procure us a table reservation in a wonderful small Italian place. He assisted us with transit bus schedule and routes, really almost anything you might need in the way of info, forgotten items, James and the entire front desk staff, Melissa, Tamsin just to name a few. If you need ANYTHING, the front desk staff ae on top of it and give 110 % service. The breakfast staff: another foray into excellence. Food was hot/cold, plentiful, and the buffet area was kept CLEAN and TIDY. It was so good to see the more…"
259,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Wonderful staff, good facilities at no extra cost. Good wholesome food that was served well and tasted as good as it looked. Staff ere friendly and very helpful. Room was clean with tea and coffee and biscuits."
260,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,The staff are very helpful and welcoming. The porridge is very tasty. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are warm and very clean. Great to have use of the health suite. Fantastic to have an electric car charging point at the Hotel.
261,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"We were here with 12 guys on a golf trip, and the whole stay was fantastic. The hotel was very clean, and all amenities were great. The staff, and in particular the General Manager James, who is clearly the face of this hotel were terrific. They even set up an early morning breakfast for us on the day of our departure as we were leaving at 5:30 AM. I would strongly recommend this hotel!!"
262,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,Very clean. Comfy. Excellent service and food. Manager (James brown) was extremely helpful as well as front desk staff. The food at both the hotel and adjoining pub was very good. This was my second stay here and would visit again if lucky enough to travel here again
263,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"This is our “go to” hotel when we visit family in Edinburgh. The staff are excellent, welcoming and ensure your stay, is a great experience. We base ourselves in the hotel and dine there, why stray outside when the food and surroundings inside are first class. For six of us there are many varied choices and as the staff are so accommodating we always feel as if we are having a huge family picnic, but with no cooking or washing up to do. We took advantage of room service which was perfect. As we only visit to see family we don’t venture far but the location is excellent if sightseeing is your aim. We feel secure having a car park at the hotel though the bus service is handy if you want to make use of that. The leisure facilities are super, helpful staff. The guests are…"
264,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"lovely hotel with friendly, helpful and knowledgable staff. food was fresh and very tasty. room was very dark ( felt claustrophobic) and we didn't realise at first that we had been put in the wheelchair user room as shower and utilities were certainly not as presented in the other rooms rather a disapointment would certainly return here with a different room only there for one night so coped"
265,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,What a great stay we had at this hotel great atmosphere easy check and was swift and pleasant. Plenty of choice at breakfast hot and cold buffet the leisure facilities were great especially after going into the city it was lovely to just come back and relax in the pool and spa sauna steam room. Towels provided! Room was clean plenty of space beds comfy bed linen hotel quality soft sheets . Hair dryer in room plenty of sockets . We dined in the restaurant on out last night and the food was fresh and lovely decent portions I opted for the lasagne my partner the local haddock .fresh coffee in the mornings at breakfast too which I love. Buses are a plenty to get into the city which cost £2.00 using the tap tap method on your debit card. They can take 15-30 minutes to get into city…
266,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"The only dinner booking left was 20h45 which was rather late but I persevered. However, I had to wait 20 minutes to be served with ordering my dinner. This is, totally, unacceptable and my dinner, only, arrived some 15 minutes later despite it being the chef's special which I would, rather, call the roast of the day. The vegetables had no taste. The room next to mine had their t.v. so loud that I had to turn on mine to 'drown' the noise."
267,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,Excellent stay. Large comfortable room on the ground floor. Lesuire facilities were very good as were the restaurants and bar.Breakfast had everything you would need. Plenty of free parking. The staff were all very friendly.
268,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Nice big room (free upgrade), peaceful. Bed was a bit hard but as I already have chronic back pain I rarely find a bed which doesn't hurt. I fell ill just as I was about to check out and they kindly let me keep the room for a bit until I felt a bit better - much appreciated thank you!"
269,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Had a easy check in Great clean room provided for our overnight stay, all staff friendly and helpful bar and dinning areas well decorated good selection of the food and drink available. I would return to this hotel"
270,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,We had a very agreeable stay. Staff and facilities were very good. The location is great for buses into city centre. The leisure facilities are very good and the bistro was very well organised re booking a slot.
271,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"We stay at Kings Manor frequently, as a couple with our 2 dogs for a stop over between northern England and the north east of Scotland. We are always impressed with the welcome that we and other guests receive from the reception staff, and for the efficiency and friendly service that we all experience from the bar and breakfast staff. Despite being on a main road, the rooms are very quiet, especially those at the back of the hotel, looking over the garden. The bedrooms, public areas and grounds are always well presented and many of the rooms have recently been upgraded. We have eaten in the bar in the evening, where there is a good bar menu, and the chef will also modify the menu where possible. There are several vegetarian and vegan options, and a changing daily special…"
272,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Fabulous dog friendly hotel. All staff lovely, welcoming & really helpful. The room was a little on the warm side but this didn’t hamper the enjoyment of the stay, when mentioned they did provide a fan, which helped a little. Intend to visit again in the future and will be recommending to everyone."
273,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Stayed here for two nights with my mum who was visiting from Germany. Booking was quick and easy, as was check in. Twin room was a good size just like the bathroom. We slept very well, ate well in the bistro one evening and enjoyed our breakfasts. Staff were customer focused, nothing was too much trouble and we felt like valued customers. Special mention to Connor at breakfast who always had a smile and was very helpful. Would recommend this hotel which also has a great gym, pool and saunas and amazing public transport links (bus #s 44 and 124 take you into Edinburgh city centre)."
274,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Amazing hotel, location and exceptional staff. We felt so welcome and staff couldn’t do enough for us. We traveled with out puppy and she was treated like royalty. Everything from breakfast, dinner and the leisure centre was exceptional"
275,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,Stayed for 4 nights on my own while partner was in hospital. Public areas are modern and clean and my room was a nice size and bed was clean and comfy and while some areas are a bit dated the hotel has everything you could need. The leisure area was a great addition and parking was easy with good public transport links. The staff were very friendly and the breakfast was lovely with the addition of some nice ‘chef’s choice’ dish when you had enough of traditional breakfast. I would definitely consider returning for a leisure break in future
276,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Having used this hotel before it continues to provide, friendly, welcoming service with comfortable rooms and surroundings for me. When looking to be Edinburgh my go to for a restful night. A short walk from the beach at Portobello and close to Brunstane Station, ideal."
277,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,What can I say amazing hotel great staff friendly polite and professional rooms are tidy clean and warm. Number 113 124 or the number 40 will get you into Edinburgh Town centre about a 20min bus journey. Train station around the corner 5min walk and the train is about 7min into Edinburgh Town centre too. The swimming pool is really good great size aswell perfect for the morning swimming. Looking forward to returning x🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 In the airport now waiting for my flight back to Wales
278,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"We stayed for 1 night as we attended a wedding in the city centre. The hotel is 10 mins in a taxi and works out cheaper than staying at a city centre hotel. The hotel staff were all really lovely and the breakfast was great. Rooms was spacious and the bed comfy. No complaints, wouldn’t hesitate to book again."
279,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff, great location, situated short bus ride from city centre, bus stop right outside the door, buses every 10 mins or so and only a couple of pound. Hotel clean and tidy, great breakfast, nice spacious room."
280,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Amazing hotel, very clean, well done to housekeeping, and comfortable! Nice bus routes to city centre. The highlight was the staff and especially Evelyn on reception who was always happy to help and give you useful information!"
281,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,This was the second time we had stayed with this hotel with our dog and we specifically chose this hotel because of our previous experience as the staff were so dog friendly. This time was no different. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and they loved our dog. The room was large and accessible and our dog felt at home there. The bed was huge and comfortable. The food was lovely except that the chocolate brownie was chocolate sponge pudding not brownie. It was nice but not what I expected.
282,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Our son was in Edinburgh for a month on a course so we decided to travel up from Manchester and pick him and his kit up and have a 2 night mini-break. Booked a 3 person family room to keep costs down :-). Good large room .comfy beds, clean. Extremely good breakfast. Use of pool included in the price too. Big plus is that Brunstane station is less than 10 mins walk away with direct train one stop into Edinburgh Waverley., so very useful for days/ nights out. 15 -20 min walk up to Portobello beach via nice Victorian streets with lovely villas . Would highly reccomend."
283,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,Stayed for 2 nights with our dog.Excellent stay..staff friendly helpful very dog friendly at breakfast .breakfast well run ..plenty of choice. Room brilliant super king-size bed and extra bed..clean ..couldn't fault it.Bus stop to Edinburgh outside hotel..Great stay..would recomend thankyou.
284,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Had the best stay at Kings Manor, I cannot fault anything!! Staff, helpful and friendly. Breakfast great choice and well presented. Rooms very clean and good size. Bed was huge and comfortable. Pool and gym. Amazing bonus for visitors. Bar and bistro, food lovely, service excellent and staff very efficient and friendly."
285,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Absolutely top place. Clean, spacious, close to city centre and most of all brilliant staff. They even decorated our room and left a congratulation card for our anniversary. Spa day tomorrow and exploring the city afterwards"
286,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"I stayed for 1 night as part of a business trip, this was by far my favourite hotel of all 4 nights. The room was larger than I was expecting, I was given a family room. The bed was a superking and really comfortable, there was an additional single bed also in the room. I was able to work from the desk in the room during the afternoon without feeling cramped and claustrophobic. I booked into the restaurant for an evening meal, the food did not disappoint. Each exchange I had with any member of staff was pleasant, I would be happy to return again on my next visit to Scotland - this time I will make full use of the facilities on site."
287,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"The staff are polite, friendly and very helpful, there is an option to eat in the bistro , but there is no pressure from the hotel staff to use it. The rooms are spacious, clean with plenty of clothes storage. Each room has kettle facilities and you can collect extra tea, coffee milk from beside reception. The use of the pool , hot tub, steam room and sauna is a added bonus. We would definitely use this hotel again. There is also a retail park a few minutes drive away which will keep you busy for hours."
288,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"The staff really are the highlight of the hotel. Genuinely friendly and helpful. As a solo female traveller I particularly noticed and appreciated the fact that the young woman on reception didn't say my room number out loud, she handed me my keycard in a wee folded card and said my room number was written inside. Room was very comfortable and spotlessly clean"
289,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"3rd stay at kings manor, wouldn't stay anywhere else, it was my 40th birthday and the room was decorated with balloons and banners. Traveled with my partner and 2 children (15 & 2). Hotel spotless, always cleaning, lovely reception staff. The location is roughly 15 mins from city centre, we had our own car but bus stop right outside the hotel. The swimming pool i couldn't get my children out! The only downside is it states in the folder the pool was open until 9.30(which it was but not to children after 7) it doesn't state that in the folder and I was in the bad books when I promised my kids a later swim on our last night. It's home from home and a very special place for us and can't wait to return again! Thank you kings manor for making my 40th birthday so special!"
290,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Comfortable room ,staff are helpful and friendly, food was very good in the bistro !!would return to this hotel .Pool and spa facilities excellent too .it was a slight problem getting back after a night out because of the distance, but managed to get a taxi after a while ! ."
291,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,The reception staff were excellent; so helpful and attentive. The bar staff were a little inexperienced however everyone needs time to learn. The restaurant food was delicious and we were served very quickly. The spa was lovely and even when there was a mix up with our bill they sorted it out right away. The rooms were clean and spacious. The team were fabulous as we were away for a friends birthday they put some banners & balloons in the room for her a nice little touch. Breakfast the next day was lovely; buffet style & although there were no eggs available when I attended the buffet station the staff swiftly brought sone over for me as soon as they were ready. Very nice stay all round with excellent customer service.
292,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Called for an overnight stay on our journey South and must say that the reception was not as expected, the staff member on the desk gave the distinct feeling that they would rather have been elsewhere than booking guests in, not even a smile or friendly greeting, we were give the room key with no explanation on how to find the room, needless to say we took the wrong lift and wandered aimlessly around trying to find the correct way until a nice friendly member of staff found us and left her laundry trolley and took us straight to the room. The room could not be faulted, it was excellent, clean, tidy and a pleasure to be in. The following morning we made our way to breakfast which left a lot to be desired, perhaps we hit it at the wrong time but were faced with a choice of two…"
293,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"I chose this hotel as it's around the corner from my brothers house. It's a great central location, close to the shops and beach. The room was perfect for me, as I was on my own with my dog, Shadow. The room was a little hot but when I asked for a fan the staff brought me one straight away. Shadow my dog was thoroughly spoilt, he got given treats at check in and then at breakfast he was given sausages and water. As I was on my own with my dog the waitresses brought me my food over, which was lovely of them. I tried haggis for the first time and I am hooked. It was yummy. Thank you for making mine and Shadows stay a good one."
294,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Lovely friendly hotel. Clean, welcoming and our Club Room gave such a spacious area. Our second visit to this hotel since last September. Ate in the restaurant one evening and food was lovely and very reasonable cost. (little surprised the bar waitress on duty didn’t know how to pour a Bacardi and coke but we soon got round that, and perhaps she was just covering the bar temporarily!) Would definitely return to this hotel when visiting Edinburgh again. Great location for bus to city centre as buses stop outside the hotel. Good breakfast buffet on offer. Good value for money all round. Reception staff very friendly. Like the environmental approach to room service the hotel adopts."
295,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"First class stay. would totally recommend Kings Manor if visiting Edinburgh. Best Breakfast, staff so friendly, Clean Bedrooms and public areas. Transport links from the airport are very good. On a sunny day the beach is beautiful."
296,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"A lovely hotel m a beautiful part of the country, vey dog friendly, the rooms are immaculate and the huge bed is reallly comfortable, will be booking again for sure when we return to visit family again"
297,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Nice room , nice hotel , lovely staff, the food was abysmal , frozen food cooked badly, I would loved to have walked into the kitchen to see what was going on , I asked for poached eggs in the morning, as I knew they would have to be cooked fresh , I don’t think they seen water , they still had the cling film marks on the egg , which was dry , poor execution of a poached egg"
298,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Good hotel about 5 miles from city centre. Large car park reached easily from the A1. Bus stop with buses every 10 mins into the city right outside. Takes 15 minutes to Princess Street. The hotel has a large reception and the staff are very. friendly. The bedroom was large with a comfortable bed, bath with shower over and tea and coffee making facilities. The hotel has a leisure centre on site which is free to hotel guests. The breakfast was buffet service, cooked breakfast good value for price. Staff pleasant and helpful. If you are travelling by car to the city then this is a very good place to stay. Park up and use public transport or walk into Portabello which takes 20 minutes. Lovely beach and choice of bars and restaurants."
299,Best Western Kings Manor Hotel,"Express check in and nicely greeted by the receptionist. Our room was very large on the top floor - well appointed and comfortable with good amenities. We ate a meal in the Bistro restaurant in the evening - it was disappointing both in terms of presentation / quality, and ambience. The restaurant had a cafe feel to it. Prior to eating, service int he bar was very poor with staff shuttling around and not making eye contact while we waited to be served. The bar ambience was poor. There was also a disparity between the bar prices promoted in the room (in the information folder) and at the bar (higher prices at the bar). This was pointed out at check out and an apology given and receptionist said this would be flagged. Breakfast was fine - our room rate included…"
300,Boulevard Hotel,"I had always used the Big Blue (the sister hotel to the BLVD) in the past, however last couple of visits were not up to scratch... so I decided to try the BLVD, and am so glad I did... the room we had was stunning, a deluxe seafront room... spotless, and a lovely bathrooms too. Breakfast both days was excellent, and on the second night we had dinner in the hotel restaurant. The food and service was top notch, and a huge thanks to Joe for looking after us so well, he was a credit to the hotel. The wine was also excellent... a 120 Pinot Noir... very yum... already booked to return for the illuminations in September... this is my new Go To hotel in Blackpool... a bit more expensive... yes but worth every penny.... Thank you to the team at BLVD... see you soon"
301,Boulevard Hotel,We decided at the last minute to go for an afternoon at the beach and then stay over at the Boulevard hotel. It’s by far the nicest hotel in Blackpool but it does come at a price so if it’s a budget stay you’re looking for then this hotel is not for you. We like the hotel because it’s out the way from the centre but there is a tram stop opposite the hotel so you can catch that to get to the centre if required. It is literally in front of the pleasure beach so if you are visiting as a family and want to be close by then it’s certainly good for this. The main reason we like this hotel is it adds a bit of luxury to your Blackpool stay but also has plenty of room for a family of 4 as the kids love the bunk beds with their own tvs. The rooms are basically like the big blue (which…
302,Boulevard Hotel,"We arrived Saturday evening, got given our room key, so we went up to our room to discover an outbreak of Midgie flies all over the window flying round the room so me and my partner went down to reception to speak to see if he dealt with we was told by the receptionist That due to the recent rain there had been an outbreak and there’s nothing they can do about it. My partner didn’t sleep a wink all night if I hadn’t had a drink I would have drove home 😔 apart from that the room was lovely"
303,Boulevard Hotel,"An impressive setting almost ‘within’ the pleasure beach. Rooms was impressive and clean with a great view. Evening meal was really nice. Breakfast was OK but we each had one nice piece of bacon and one tough piece, which suggests some food is held under a heat lamp. As it was table service on the days we visited,you’d expect everything to be cooked to order at this standard of hotel!"
304,Boulevard Hotel,Hotel is beautiful. The rooms are lovely the breakfast was nice. However The management off this hotel needs to learn how to speak to people. It’s clear he has no experience in running any business.they need to not let children anywhere near the management. Shocking behaviour.
305,Boulevard Hotel,Just a little trip to celebrate my husband’s retirement birthday before having a family celebration with the family and grandkids all running around have fun and us spoiling them instead of him being spoiled
306,Boulevard Hotel,We were delighted we chose to stay at this property. It was absolutely perfect and we can not fault in any way. Room was amazing as well as the rest of the hotel and staff provided a1st class service. The location of the hotel was unreal. Perfect for the kids with a view from our room over the theme park. Excellent !!!!
307,Boulevard Hotel,"Absolutely faultless hotel, it is even more beautiful in person and extremely clean. Great food, location, value for money and top class service. We wouldn’t stay anywhere else in Blackpool now. Thanks for giving us a great last minute mini-honeymoon!"
308,Boulevard Hotel,Absolute joke off a hotel I paid £140 for a room then £100 for damages waver so we check out and on the way home I got a notice off the bank that another £300 had been taken from my account from the hotel rang to see what was happening to be told that we had been smoking in the room and that a charge off £300 was made from my card on file for another £300 on top off the £100 they already had without being told whatsoever the thing is me and my wife don’t even smoke and the hotel don’t care on the phone all I get is it’s hotel policy if that’s the case then it should be told out loud to there customers but no staff a rude and very arrogant will never be recommend by myself that’s for certain !!
309,Boulevard Hotel,"We took the 3 Grand Children ( 9, 7 & 15mths ) with us and we booked a family room with sea view. On arrival we were greeted by a lovely lady for checkin, which was very quick, first impression at reception was wonderful very clean people very polite, Our room was on the first floor (120) on our way to the room the Hotel was spotless and entering the room was wow, so clean an set out so nice, 10/10 to the House Keeping staff. Fabulous Hotel friendly and helpful staff throughout the Hotel When we were ready to leave we went back down to Reception however the Front Door was closed and we had to go out at the back of the Hotel where the car park is which having children with you is quite dangerous as there is a bad corner and the walking area is on the other-side so unsure why we…"
310,Boulevard Hotel,Couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay to suit us in a town full of many different styles and types of accommodation available to meet the needs of the wide diversity of tourists visiting. This hotel along with it’s neighbour look like they are leading the regeneration of an area on the outskirts of the town which looks like it has been a bit forgotten and neglected.
311,Boulevard Hotel,"This was my second stay, this time in an executive double overlooking the theme park. The room wasn’t ready on arrival but it was only 20 minutes or so and the room was immaculate when I did check in. All the staff in every department are super friendly and well just 10/10 really. The theme park package with breakfast is worth booking direct with the hotel as you also get direct access to the park rather than have to walk all the way round and it’s much better value than booking everything separate."
312,Boulevard Hotel,The hotel was amazing 5*. Very clean and staff couldn’t do enough for you. Lovely location. Food was amazing. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others and I wouldn’t stay anywhere else when visiting Blackpool.
313,Boulevard Hotel,"My 5th visit and as always, fantastic food and amazing service in an excellent hotel. I dined in the hotel restaurant every day and the food and service is always superb. The rooms are very high quality, very clean and well maintained, all looked after by the excellent housekeeping team. All the staff are friendly and I can’t fault anything in the hotel. Thank you for an enjoyable stay and I’m looking forward to my next stay, which is already booked."
314,Boulevard Hotel,Have stayed in the BLVD every year for the past 3 years now. Hotel is beautiful inside and out. The member discount you get after staying once is also very good. The theme park and sea views are a cherry on top which makes it that bit more special! Never had a bad stay and highly recommend anyone coming to Blackpool or The Pleasure Beach to stay. Also any merch you buy in the park can be delivered to your room free of charge to save you carrying it around the park all day!
315,Boulevard Hotel,"Had to attend a meeting here, the first thing that strikes you is how close the hotel is to the pleasure beach (which makes for some great photos) but despite the locale. It is a beautiful hotel, the staff are highly professional and the facilities are excellent. There are few hotels for business that I would return to with my family and this is one of them. Absolutely faultless."
316,Boulevard Hotel,Upon arrival our welcome at reception was friendly and we was provided with all information needed despite staying there before. Our room was spacious and clean and had refreshments available. The hotel is nicely presented. The location is perfect for visiting the pleasure beach and also a good location for visiting other landmarks in Blackpool. It is a peaceful location as it is located away from nightlife.
317,Boulevard Hotel,"Lovely clean hotel , great staff , and location . Great food , though self service hot breakfast would of been preferred as haveing to queue and be served was 15 mins ! And hot drinks would be better from a machine as was Luke warm on refill by waitress . Other than that ,, a great stay"
318,Boulevard Hotel,"My partner and I stayed for 3 nights (fri-mon), we joined my in-laws who were staying a full week (mon-mon). The hotel by far exceeded our expectations in every aspect. Nothing was too much trouble and all staff did their jobs with a smile. The attention to detail was impeccable and the service was second to none. We stayed on the 4th floor with a balcony/sea-view room. The whole suite was sparkling. We had complimentary VOSS water replaced in the mini fridge each day. The bathrooms had double sinks with a double shower and separate bath complete with a tv on the wall. The BALMAIN soaps and shampoo and conditioner really give a wow factor although not complimentary (I wish!) The lounge area had the most beautiful fireplace and every piece of furniture was so comfy! We ate dinner…"
319,Boulevard Hotel,Great value quality hotel in Blackpool - located right next to The Pleasure Beach. Staff were super friendly and welcoming and the breakfast was delicious. If you are looking for a quality hotel in Blackpool- this is the place to choice - 5 Stars all round!!
320,Boulevard Hotel,"I stayed at the BLVD Hotel on business and found everything about my stay was exceptional. There was a hiccup with the booking, but this was dealt with, with no problems whatsoever. I ate at the restaurant that evening, which was delicious, and well presented. The service staff were very helpful and I could not fault them."
321,Boulevard Hotel,Four of us stayed at this hotel and was charged £100 Deposit upon check in per couple and £10 for parking per day for each car. The place is nice but you need a healthy bank account to stay. Our room was 424 and it was nice. The interesting part of the stay was the next morning when I noticed a lens inside the smoke alarm above the bed. I took some pictures of the this and the make and model. I didn't mention anything about it on checking out but did some research when I got home and nothing shows anything about a lens inside. Very strange.
322,Boulevard Hotel,"My husband and I had a 1 night stay in a lovely, comfortable, good sized and clean room. (Deluxe Adult Only Room). We booked a table in the restaurant (only 1 other table occupied) and both ordered a starter (which was not available). A bit disappointing but the food we ordered was good. We also included breakfast in our stay and my husband asked for a Flat White coffee and was told that would cost extra as it had to come from the bar. Not the best response or service from a 5* hotel. The drinks at the hotel bar were very expensive (which I guess is what you'd expect for hotel prices) but £32 for 2 shorts and mixers was a bit over the top! We would stay here again on a room only basis."
323,Boulevard Hotel,We had a wonderful 3 night stay here on 5th May. Rooms & staff were excellent. The design and decor in this hotel is absolutely stunning. What perfect surroundings to be in. HUGE DOWNSIDE. The discrimination of cash payers. Something I feel very strongly about and feel businesses should RESPECT customers wishes to pay by cash which is. LEGAL TENDER
324,Boulevard Hotel,"From the moment my wife and I arrived, the staff made our puppy (Obi) feel pampered. The room was a tad smaller than what I was expected due to the photos on the hotel’s website, but that aside the room was just right. The view overlooking the sea was just perfect. Prior to my original booking, I asked if the hotel was dog friendly. It certainly is. We stayed a total of 3 nights for a chilled and relaxing time. This was what we got. All the staff from the reception to the waiting staff, even the housekeeping staff made my puppy feel at home, which to me made a huge difference."
325,Boulevard Hotel,"Friendly staff on arrival & absolutely lovely hotel inside & especially the room ,had a beautiful view of the sea & promenade.Everthing in the room you need, plenty of space , smelled so lovely & clean plus a really comfy bed ."
326,Boulevard Hotel,"A real gem in an unusual position in the shadow of the Big One. Lovely decor, really well thought through with great attention to detail. Room was excellent, really quiet, comfy and the kid free floor is a great idea. Its well worth the money to uograde to the better rooms. Food in the bar was average which stood out vs the high standards everywhere else. Staff were great, really friendly and helpful."
327,Boulevard Hotel,"Suggest if you are looking for a fantastic hotel the boulevard will meet all your expectations, service and hospitality was exceptional, rooms were terrific meet a very high standard which also helped after a busy day enjoying time with the family."
328,Boulevard Hotel,"Very nice hotel in south shore Blackpool lovely rooms and great bar in a quiet area, breakfast is great and it’s right next to the pleasure beach and around a 5 minute walk to the south pier I will definitely return"
329,Boulevard Hotel,"Another great stay at the Boulevard. This was our third time. Beautiful hotel, great staff and lovely rooms. We stayed last year and the price of the stay included breakfast. That is now not the case and breakfast is charged as extra which at £19 per person is in my opinion overly expensive, hence we did not have it. Other than that small gripe it certainly would not stop me from staying again."
330,Boulevard Hotel,Arrived early to find room ready so was able to get changed and head out early for the evenng. Room was excellent with loads of extras such as shaving kit etc. NIce little touches such as free fruit around the hotel and Blackpool rock in the way of small sweets freely available. large bed very comfortable room very clean.
331,Boulevard Hotel,"This was supposed to be a 5 star hotel there is just no way, £600 for a 2 night stay and then charged £20 extra for parking on leaving which I was told i would of been told about, I was asked if I had a car but no one mentioned the hidden parking costs. £100 deposit also took on top of this, which they take from your bank and it still hasn't been returned as of yet. I paid for a sea view, I would of had this had the windows not been filthy. The breakfast was not nice, very little and very hard as though been lying under a light. We did not dine in the restaurant after what we have been served. The bath was tiny not big enough. The toilet paper you could see through. My son got his arm stuck climbing into the bunk bed, not very kid friendly when this is who it is aimed at. Our…"
332,Boulevard Hotel,"People asked why pay a little more for a room in Blackpool, answer: as I knew it would be stress free and perfect. Thank you to all the staff that made our stay perfect my son Jake loved his surprise for his 10th Birthday and it was totally stress free."
333,Boulevard Hotel,"One night stay in a family room as was seeing a show at the Opera House. Location is away from the super busy area of Blackpool but close enough to South Pier for all the traditional Blackpool activities. We had afternoon tea which was fabulous, and room service was equally good. All staff are so lovely and welcoming, the standard of service was high. The rooms are extremely clean, the bunk beds and king bed were very comfortable, lots of USB ports, shower hot and powerful, can control the temp of the room, plenty of towels and pillows. Wish we could have stayed a bit longer. Thank you to all the staff, you made our girlie weekend (Nana, mum and 15 yr old daughter) very special. Would definitely recommend Boulevard Hotel to a friend."
334,Boulevard Hotel,"Nice decor but everything is too expensive, hotel was empty and still charged excessive amount for an extra few hours. Bed was hard. Hotel next door is better value. Wouldn't go back as not worth the money"
335,Boulevard Hotel,"A return visit to Boulevard Hotel to take advantage of their excellent Sunday night dinner and B&B promotion. Happy to report that, if anything, they've managed to improve still further. Great continuity of staff and the food & drink teams continue to excel. Superb rooms, impeccably clean hotel throughout, a real feel of quality."
336,Boulevard Hotel,"My stay at the hotel was very satisfying at every level. The clean environment, the rooms, the staffs, the location, the food, the car park etc was impressive. I will definitely recommend Boulevard hotel Blackpool to my friends and family with pride."
337,Boulevard Hotel,"I had a beautiful family room overlooking the sea. Very clean and a comfortable bed. The staff at all times were smiley and nothing was too much trouble. The food was excellent, good breakfast and great staff. Taxis to the tower were very expensive, a return trip cost me £22 which I was very surprised rapt, but the tram Stop is a short distance from the hotel. Would recommend this hotel"
338,Boulevard Hotel,"This hotel is the best in blackpool, can be slightly expensive when not using the room for long (only sleeping) but what a good night sleep, its a beautiful hotel and worth the extra expence, staff are so friendly and helpfull."
339,Boulevard Hotel,Lovely hotel but they leave out information like £100 authorisation fee which is very expensive when you don’t expect it then on leaving your told will take up to 10 days to revive balance back into your account
340,Boulevard Hotel,"Lovely, comfortable and clean environment. Great access to the park. Lovely staff and service. Breakfast buffet was a little slow going but food was good. Perhaps a little pricey for the food but still enjoyed"
341,Boulevard Hotel,Excellent hotel with good facilities and very accommodating staff. If you need an accessible room check to make sure it has a walk-in shower. Ours didn’t - wife with a broken arm struggled with shower over the bath. Hotel was full so we couldn’t move rooms. Otherwise splendid place with good food.
342,Boulevard Hotel,Second stay at this lovely hotel. Everything about it is great. Rooms are clean and spacious and it is rather fun to have a view of the rollercoasters. Food is excellent and the staff are efficient and friendly.
343,Boulevard Hotel,"Staff were very professional and polite. The rooms were clean and tidy with plenty of toiletries, tea and coffee. Great location with plenty of restaurants close by. Tram and bus stop right outside too. Would definitely recommend staying here."
344,Boulevard Hotel,"Had a great overnight stay with the Sunday evening package of Dinner, Bed and Breakfast. Just double check your invoice when checking out as for some reason the evening meal gets added on again to the bill. Have stayed twice and same thing happened each time. Reception staff adjusted the bill. Friendly staff and food was great. I will definitely stay again."
345,Boulevard Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, we stayed in a room overlooking the Pleasure Beach, very clean close to the beach and love the superking bed and furnishings. Staff lovely and food in the bar was great. Would definitely stay again."
346,Boulevard Hotel,"Great stay lovely staff all polite very helpful with any questions u have tasty breakfast , very nice bar food , restaurant also very nice food ,cleanliness brilliant, close to amusement and pleasure beach overall stay excellent would definitely recommend"
347,Boulevard Hotel,"Staff were so friendly, so polite, very lovely, hotel was amazing, so clean and well maintained, breakfast was very nice, would definitely come back :) so happy with the service, room was perfect :) very clean, had an amazing stay.."
348,Boulevard Hotel,"Stayed for 1 night but I wish we could have stayed longer. Room was spotless, loved the coffee machine. We had a sofa with a sea view which was such a bonus. We had lunch, dinner and breakfast at the hotel and everything was delicious. The pancake machine was a particular highlight!"
349,Boulevard Hotel,"Another amazing stay. We stayed here in 2019 just after it opened and had a fantastic time, but it was brand new with some teething problems. When we stayed this time, the hotel has eveloved and grown becoming a welcoming well run hotel. The room was a deluxe room which had a side view on to the pleasure beach and it was great as always to see the big one. The room was very warm but a tweak of the temperature and also having windows that opened, sorted the problem. The room was on the third floor which is an adult only floor. The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed the amenities. We where booked in for bed and breakfast with evening meal on the first night. The evening meal was lovely but the set menu could do with additional main course options although you can pick from the A…"
350,South Lawn Hotel,We stayed one night and had a lovely time. The bonus was Milford on sea which was only 20 minutes drive from the hotel. Staff was very polite and accommodating. Plenty of car parking spaces and outside sitting areas to enjoy long summer days.
351,South Lawn Hotel,"Very friendly staff. Nice rooms Great value.We stayed for two nights and as always with this hotel were looked after very well. Nothing was to much trouble. Building work is going on at present, but this did not spoil our stay. Highly Recommend this hotel.Thank You."
352,South Lawn Hotel,Have been staying at this hotel for a number of years and very pleased with the constant improvements being made by Nikki and Tim. Lovely hotel and a great place to stay and eat. Try the kipper for brakfast.
353,South Lawn Hotel,"We spent 3 nights at the South Lawn Hotel, the hotel and grounds are in a lovely setting. The hotel is well presented and the new accommodation is well equipped with every thing you need, hairdryer, iron, ironing board and kettle with tea and coffee facilities., also a fan which was needed as we were there during a very hot spell . The paddock area for dogs is a great idea and the garden was a lovely place to have a pre dinner drink. Renovations are taking place but this didn’t spoil our stay. We would definitely like to return."
354,South Lawn Hotel,"It's a lovely experience at South Lawn. We are always well looked after, the rooms are spotless and comfortable. It is so nice to see the same onsiderate and pleasant staff still there, its a great place for a break. Even the construction work being undertaken at present did not have any adverse affect on our stay. The gardens and grounds were still open to enjoy a drink inthe sun."
355,South Lawn Hotel,Excellent stay as always ❤️❤️❤️ Just love coming to South Lawns. So dog friendly. Loving all the new rooms. Great side door to take the dogs out into the paddock area which is a lot bigger. Dogs love it.
356,South Lawn Hotel,"Another lovely stay at South Lawn Hotel. All the staff are so helpful and friendly, they really make you feel welcome. Our room was spacious and very comfy and it was handy having the mini fridge. Even though there was still some building work happening it didn't affect our stay at all. We will hopefully return very soon."
357,South Lawn Hotel,"We stayed for a quick one night stay on the way to another location and had such a lovely time that we would definitely return if we come down this way again. The reception staff were excellent, smiling and bantering (even when we left early in the morning) and the restaurant staff were excellent also. The breakfast was delicious and the room was comfortable and quiet."
358,South Lawn Hotel,"Room 10. Very spacious nice and roomy, clean and tidy. Lovely bathroom, even has a roll top bath and double shower. View of Lawned garden. Bar and restaurant nice. Good food. Staff very pleasant and knowledgeable. Enjoyed my stay 1 night. I shall be back at some point."
359,South Lawn Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, beautiful location. Highly recommend. Staff were very helpful and polite. Although you could bring pets we did not take ours but this did not affect our stay. Lovely places nearby to visit."
360,South Lawn Hotel,"We had such a great stay at South Lawn Hotel. Our room was spacious and it was good to have a small fridge. The bed was comfy and everywhere was really clean. They gave our dog a really sweet goodie bag, which we thought was a very nice touch. It is also great that there is a small paddock area where the dogs can run around. All the staff were friendly and nice and the location of the Hotel is good with the village of Milford just a 15 minute walk away and the beach only another 10 minutes walk. We would stay there again and highly recommend to others."
361,South Lawn Hotel,I was staying on my own with my dog. Staff were extremely helpful and polite. My dog even had a doggy bag with treats etc in. The room was very clean and comfortably suitable for my needs. Very happy to have a small fridge in the room as I don’t drink and so I was able to keep some milk cool for me to use instead. I didn’t eat in the restaurant as I was visiting my Mum in a care home nearby so I spent much of the time with her. I only made use of the continental breakfast that was available. I have already booked to stay again later in the year. It’s in a perfect location to walk my dog on the open forest and to visit the local nature reserve with my camera too.
362,South Lawn Hotel,"Wonderful location, rooms excellent and all the staff friendly, I would recommend this hotel, sitting in the gardens having a nice drink in wonderful setting made it most enjoyable and so quite and a pleasant 10 minute walk takes you into Milford on Sea."
363,South Lawn Hotel,Since our last visit the hotel has undergone a complete makeover. The room we stayed in was fantastic very clean and comfortable with everything nicely coordinated plenty of sockets storage and mirrors we even had a mini fridge. The staff were also very friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend staying here
364,South Lawn Hotel,"We booked last minute on a whim and were made to feel very welcome by all the staff. Our room in the new block was lovely; clean, good sized and with a large, super comfy bed. Our dog loved the goodie bag and exercise paddock and was able to join us in the restaurant’s special dog friendly area. Wished we were staying longer!"
365,South Lawn Hotel,"Bought a voucher for my Mum to stay here with the dog for 3 nights. Did some minor research before getting the voucher and was happy with what I saw. Closer to the time of our booking I did a bit more digging only to find more positive reviews and little surprises to look forward to. I can honestly say this location does not disappoint, we stayed in a newly refurbished room which was spacious, well decorated, comfortably modern with plenty of storage. We had a medium sized dog with us who had plenty of room to mooch about without getting underfoot. There was a fridge in the room, iron + board, hairdryer, shower gel and shampoo, ample amounts of coffee and breakfast tea and a table with 2 chairs for lounging. The room had a large walk in shower which was easy to use and was…"
366,South Lawn Hotel,"Clean, comfortable, friendly and helpful staff, great food and dog friendly; even got a sausage for breakfast and a doggy bag!! with a lovely paddock to let dogs run! Spacious rooms with the most comfortable bed and pillows. Great base for exploring. Only complaint is we didn’t book longer time!!"
367,South Lawn Hotel,Hotel & Staff all very good. Enjoyed our stay and will be returning. The bedrooms & bathrooms are spotless. The bed was very comfortable There is always someone on reception to assist with queries. Excellent
368,South Lawn Hotel,"Had a great experience at this family run business, very friendly staff and great food. Stayed in the new wing first floor which was really nice and clean. Ate in the restaurant which was really nice. Location is ideal, quiet and close to the beach by car."
369,South Lawn Hotel,"We had a one night stay with dinner gifted to us and what a gift this turned out to be. Our room was lovely - spacious, comfortable and overlooking the grounds at the back. There was a fridge in the room which, whilst a little noisy, could be useful. We had been informed of building work to the front (a new restaurant) but this was not intrusive. We took a damp stroll into the village and on to the seafront which takes about 20 minutes. One of the footpaths back takes you through a wetland nature reserve. The Norman church is also worth a visit. As part of our stay we had dinner in the hotel's Cedar Tree restaurant and we could not fault the meal. The menu isn't extensive, but I think it's all the better for that as the quality was excellent. The hotel is dog friendly -…"
370,South Lawn Hotel,we came for one night on 13/5/2023 and enjoyed it so much that we came for the weekend the following week it was fantastic to find a real dog-friendly hotel where Archie could come with us everywhere and the goodie bag was such a nice touch room perfect clean comfortable beds plenty of tea and coffee we will be back in a few weeks time thank you everyone at Southlawn
371,South Lawn Hotel,"Thought the hotel was great, room excellent and clean. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We are in the restaurant which was lovely. Easy to walk into Milford- on-sea. Facilities for our dog were great. Definitely visit again."
372,South Lawn Hotel,"A lovely hotel with really friendly staff. The food is excellent and although we were told about some building work going on around the hotel it was barely noticeable. Location is perfect for sea and forest, an easy walk onto the local village. We will definitely go again."
373,South Lawn Hotel,"Wonderful location with ample parking. Hotel extensively refurbished. Great facilities, we would certainly stay again. Excellent meal in the Cedar restaurant DBB did not have a cash limit applied to diner menu."
374,South Lawn Hotel,"Had a lovely stay at South Lawn. Upgraded at last minute and stayed in room 81 (king) in the new part of the hotel. Rooms were spacious, modern and clean. We had our French bulldog with us and this hotel accommodated brilliantly for him. Upon check in we were handed a doggy gift bag with a few necessities in, including poo bags a ball and personalised food/water bowl which came in very handy as we left ours at home! They had an enclosed paddock where the dogs could be off the lead and have a run."
375,South Lawn Hotel,"My husband and l was brought a night away for our birthdays by our son, and he differently pick a lovely hotel. The room was spotless everything was in there we needed even a iron and ironing board my husband needed for a shirt. Plenty of tea coffee etc. We also had our Jack Russell dog with us and he was given a goody bag which he loved especially the biscuits. The staff were very friendly We will differently visit again."
376,South Lawn Hotel,"What a lucky find this was. We were looking for a relaxing base for a week's stay in an area we don't know and this more than met the brief. The communication after booking was welcoming and very helpful. We were warned of building works in case we wanted to change our minds, but as described, they didn't impinge on our stay at all. Our room in the new wing was comfortable and spacious with tasteful furnishings, walk in shower room and useful stuff like wall/reading lights with usb charging ports. More storage than we could possibly use, and a nice view of the fields out back while we drank tea from the well stocked facilities. Plenty of seating in the lounge and outside if you fancied a change. Easy parking. The staff were all lovely, nothing was too much trouble. Filtered…"
377,South Lawn Hotel,"This was our second stay at this wonderfull hotel.its amazing,staff are excellent and friendly,lovelyfood,immaculate spacious rooms.Already planning another stay later this year.well done all keep up the superb work,kind regards steve"
378,South Lawn Hotel,"It was an absolute pleasure to stay at this hotel, very welcoming, very clean, could not fault the bedroom. We upgraded to a king bed which im glad we did. even had a min fridge in the room which was really handy as we had brought drinks with us. very accommodating. We didn't realise dogs were allowed to stay in your room, this didn't bother us as we didn't really hear them. it was a bit weird eating your breakfast in a room with the dogs to but they were all very well behaved."
379,South Lawn Hotel,This is not only a family run hotel it is an hotel where you feel that you are part of the family. The team led by Nikki & Tim are amazing there is never a time when they and their team are not working to provide their guests with a perfect stress free holiday experience. It is not only a pleausre to stay in this hotel it is a privilledge. This review is based on experience having stayed at the hotel multiple times in the last two years during each visit we and our dog have been made very welcome.
380,South Lawn Hotel,"The hotel and room were clean. The facilities for our two dogs were excellent including a doggy bag for each pooch on arrival and an unexpected sausage for breakfast and a lovely, secure field adjacent to the hotel."
381,South Lawn Hotel,"Found this hotel via virgin experience days and we were so glad that we did! The hotel exceeded our expectations, it was lovely from start to finish. The hotel was so well catered to dogs, our dog got a goodie bag on arrival, there is an enclosed paddock you can take them to and they’re allowed everywhere with you in the hotel; including breakfast. The hotel room was so modern and clean; we really felt at home here. The continental breakfast was small but we really enjoyed what was on offer and it was all fresh. Very friendly staff and in a lovely location close to the beach. Would love to stay again."
382,South Lawn Hotel,Lovely clean hotel with friendly staff. Hotel is Dog friendly which was lovely Hotel had a lovely relaxing atmosphere would definitely return. Check in was easy and fuss free and everything needed was available in the room.
383,South Lawn Hotel,Very nice Hotel with friendly staff. The rooms are great and we had a nice view over the fields. Good location to visit the coast or New Forest. What more could you ask for when looking for a break away from home.
384,South Lawn Hotel,"Amazing stay, bedrooms very clean & spacious and beds very comfortable. Food is very nice and staff very nice and helpful. Gardens very well maintained and lovely seating area outside Lots of parking too"
385,South Lawn Hotel,We had a really nice overnight stay on our way to the Isle of Wight. Great room with lovely comfortable bed. The staff were pleasant. We would definitely stay again as it is less than 10mins away from ferry terminal.
386,South Lawn Hotel,"A lovely, comfortable, clean hotel with an excellent restaurant. Only a mile from the sea! Superb location to visit Beaulieu National Motor Museum and Sammy Miller Motorcycle Museum (which is what we did)"
387,South Lawn Hotel,Absolutely loved our stay. Everything we hoped for and more. Excellent staff. Spotlessly clean. Very comfortable bedroom with a beautiful bathroom. Food in the restaurant was extremely good. Would love to stay again.
388,South Lawn Hotel,"Had a great 3 nights away at South Lawn! This was our second visit and I expect there will be more visits in the future. The room was very comfortable and clean. Thought had gone into providing comfort for every eventuality with the provision of ironing facility, fan, additional heater... Staff were very friendly and obliging. We appreciated the warning about the building work taking place but it had no effect on the enjoyment of our stay. Had a relaxing few days exploring the beautiful New Forest area."
389,South Lawn Hotel,"What a wonderful 2 night stay in this lovely country hotel. Our room was so clean and very comfortable with everything necessary for a short break. Breakfast was deicious, and we chose to have dinner on the first night which was superb....so much so we wish we had eaten there the second night too All the staff were very friendly. Couldn't fault anything at all....even the fact there was building work going on, which we were advised of prior to our booking, didn't effect the stay. The area is beautiful to visit. Well recommended and will return again."
390,South Lawn Hotel,Excellent our 3rd stay won't be our last beautiful location large comfortable rooms ample car parking 15 minute walk from the coast regular bus service into Lymington and Christchurch Excellent friendly staff
391,South Lawn Hotel,We spent one night here and had a lovely stay. Room was immaculate with an excellent shower room. Beds very comfortable and room large and well equipped . Easy parking and quiet setting. Had evening meal and breakfast at the Cedar restaurant. Both were excellent. Would return .
392,South Lawn Hotel,"We stayed at hotel for 6 nights and as usual it was a fabulous break. The room was bright airy & well appointed. The food was very good and beautifully presented, staff obviously take great pride in their roles and are so polite and nothing was too much trouble. We’ve been coming here since 2015 and enjoyed every stay, we’ve booked up again for June. Top class - say no more!…."
393,South Lawn Hotel,"The quality of the meals was of a high order and the service was very efficient, even at busy times. Throughout the hotel the staff were excellent, and reflected a high degree of motivation and work ethic. The current building work had no adverse effects on our enjoyment."
394,South Lawn Hotel,"Fantastic again! Just had 2 excellent nights at this ever improving hotel and booked for June already. New rooms in the extension are superb & looking forward to the restaurant extension. We genuinely support the continued success of this hotel, it's a great venue with great staff. Highly recommended."
395,South Lawn Hotel,"Very comfortable and pleasant stay. The room was excellent, very quiet and with a nice view over the fields. Very good shower with luxurious fluffy towels. Staff very friendly and helpful. Plenty of car parking spaces."
396,South Lawn Hotel,"This was our third visit to this hotel and it won't be our last. The accommodation and staff at this hotel are excellent and hence our return visits speaks volumes. the hotel has been enlarged since our first visit and by the time of our next visit the extension to the restaurant will have been completed, which we are looking forward."
397,South Lawn Hotel,"We have just returned from our second stay here and again everything was excellent. We stayed with our doggo. This is the most dog friendly hotel we have ver stayed in. Upon arrival we were given a treat bag for our dog which was a lovely touch. Considering the amount of dogs staying at the hotel it was so clean and did not have that ‘dog’ smell which was great. All of the staff are so friendly and really do want to make your stay the best it can be. The food was high quality too. The chefs recommend menu is excellent value at only £18.50 for 2 courses, my only criticism of it was that every night each dish was served with mash potato but if you like mash them you are in to a winner. Overall we had a fabulous stay and will certainly be booking again. Thanks to all."
398,South Lawn Hotel,"The room was very good.....large, well appointed, and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food in the Cedar Restaurant was superb. An extension to the dinlng room is being built - should improve things even further. Highly recommend this hotel!!"
399,South Lawn Hotel,Whole experience was very good. We had a great room on the ground floor. King size bed that was very comfortable. Cleanliness was superb with walk in shower and toilet. Plenty of towels and shampoo and shower gel supplied.
400,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Thoroughly enjoyed relaxing at the titanic hotel, fantastic room, lovely bar and restaurant. The food was excellent and the service was superb, our waiter Josh was brilliant, a real asset to the hotel. Would highly recommend. We will be returning again."
401,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"No faults from us. WHAT A PLACE. Lovely hotel, nice feel about the whole hotel. Clean, tidy, spacious. Everyone was welcoming. Decent buffet breakfast. Views of the dock and old tobacco warehouse (it's being done up to luxury apartments) a large but charming semi derelict warehouse on one side and a view of Everton's new stadium on the other. An Uber into the city center is around £8-10 or a 30 min walk."
402,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"The hotel is dramatic and comfortable, staff friendly and helpful. We loved our room and enjoyed dinner in the hotel restaurant. The location is a little distance from the main attractions but the setting is wonderful. We would go back without hesitation."
403,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"We stayed at Titanic on May 30th for our anniversary. We booked a superior dockside room and were surprisingly upgraded to a presidential suite which was out of this world. The room was huge and immaculate-it was perfect 😍. The staff at the hotel are so helpful and friendly, creating the perfect atmosphere throughout. The dining was beautiful & delicious, the iceberg cocktail was the best 😉. From booking in to leaving we had the best time sitting dockside for drinks and lunch to all the titanic related decor and views this place offers. We will definitely be coming back."
404,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Just returned from a brilliant stay at the titanic hotel! Stayed in a superior room with my husband and two children. Room was huge, and immaculately clean. All staff we encountered were very friendly and professional. The food in the restaurant is really good, I am a self confessed food snob and it was all exceptional. Fish and chips and pasta ragu are the best I have had in a hotel in England. It is a long journey for us but totally worth it, very good value for a 5 star hotel with five star food and drinks. We love Liverpool and will definitely return."
405,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Fantastic overnight stay at the Titanic. Staff are very welcoming and on hand at just the right pitch. Food, cocktails amazing. We've left feeling chilled and well rested. Spent two hours in the spa and found the facilities clean well thought out and the best of all....relaxing. Ticked all the boxes, and we look forward to returning."
406,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Booked a one night stay at this hotel. Evening meal and breakfast included. Very good value for money. the parking machine was broken we had free parking which is always a bonus. Check in was a little disappointing we where told if we came after 1pm are room would be possibly ready but it wasn’t and the receptionist was quite of with us saying this is impossible it’s 3pm check in lots of couples like us sat around waiting we must have all got it wrong! The hotel is lovely and spacious and very clean but dull lighting everywhere. We slept well and the shower was powerful. No pool and £20 each to go in the spar small dip pool very disappointing for such a large hotel. Food was wonderful evening meal absolutely delicious and the buffet breakfast just superb. Service excellent in…
407,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Our third visit here, we love short breaks in our wonderful city. After a shaky start on and shortly after our arrival which was expertly dealt with by Spa Manager/ On Duty Manager Sophie (thanks Sophie ) who came to our aid, we settled in for a fantastic stay for our special occasion. It is a pleasure to stay in this historic building so close to the river. The Spa was great, evening food was tasty (the menu has changed) and the Breakfast was yum! We can't wait to come again!"
408,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"My favourite hotel in Liverpool. . Clean, spacious rooms with all you could need for your stay . Friendly and welcoming staff .Nothing was too much trouble . Can’t wait to come back for a 3rd visit soon"
409,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Firstly, this was booked by my wife, for my 50th birthday celebrations, so we booked in total 5 rooms, 3 of which were for 2 nights. My wife had pre-booked Afternoon Tea for Saturday afternoon, when we arrived at the restaurant no one had our booking. We had to wait a few minutes to sort out a table. Just to make you aware, it was not busy at all, so wasn’t sure why it took so long!!! When we sat down, we waited for 20 minutes, before the lady at the front desk came over to take our order, not one waiter had come over to check on us, totally unacceptable. After a further 20 minutes, a waiter brought one afternoon tea and put it on the table. He didn’t ask who it was for just left it. At this point we hadn’t had any drinks, as no one had come over to take any orders. The lady…"
410,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Check in was … ok. Person at reception didn’t make any type of conversation. The hotel itself was beautiful. Room was spacious and very easy on the eye. The bathroom had a walk in rain shower big enough for two. Towels, shampoo and conditioner supplied. Iron and hair dryer in the room,. TV was small for the size of the room. The bed was large and comfortable. We booked a meal at the restaurant on site which we had a three course meal included in our room price. We were seated by a waiter and given menus. We chose out three course meal. First and second course came quickly and food was lovely. We then waited 40 minutes for our dessert. We asked the waiter how long it would then it within 5 minutes it appeared. I think they forgot about it. Then came the bill… we were changed…"
411,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"It was perfect from word go. Lovely welcome and quick service. Room was big with a good overview of the Stanley Dock. Bath was massive and amazing. Room service perfect, quick and quality. Great night sleep. Liverpool football team were staying there and there was a good vibe within the hotel. Breakfast high quality and plenty to choose from Check out smooth. Probably my favourite new place ever"
412,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"There are indeed many excellent things about the Titanic hotel. For instance, the rooms are exceptionally good value and are absolutely enormous in size. I've also eaten in the restaurant for dinner, which was very good, and also had lunch in the main bar, which was also very good. However, room-service breakfast is very disappointing so do not order that - best to go to the restaurant. The issue I have with my recent stay is the inexcusable poor service from the main reception desk. We couldn't have been treated any worse. In addition, the hotel's IT system was down for 3+ days, meaning that you had to pay for everything as you went along (rather than charging to the room). The hotel kept promising that the system would be back-up soon, but that was not the case. By…"
413,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"We were lucky enough to stay at the Titanic Hotel for our trip to Liverpool for Eurovision, and from arrival were absolutely blown away at the quality of the hotel. The building itself is specatcular and incredibly restored, in a great location and with ample parking. The interior is beautifully designed, feeling spacious, luxururious and comfortable, with many tasteful references to the building's history and namesakes (ill-fated) voyage. From check-in, to the bar, conscierge, cleaning and breakfast team, all staff were superb, helpful and friendly. Having booked the Classic Double Room, we were lucky enough to be put in room 437 which had spectacular views across the Wirral, and was large, well-appointed, and very comfortable and relaxing after a long-drive. As a huge fan…"
414,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"There can't be many hotel rooms larger than those at the Titanic. They are immense. Wonderful old Dock building, tastefully made into a cracking hotel about twenty minutes walk from ""Central Liverpool"" Nice bars. Decent food. On site car parking at £8/ day. But the bedrooms are the best bit. Almost 30ft by 18ft and with vaulted brick ceilings about twelve foot high. Lovely comfy bed. Desk, settee, sofa at the foot of the bed. It really is a cracker of a place to stay if you don't need to be right in the heart of the city, and can manage being a little bit out."
415,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Super overnight stay at the Titanic. The room was huge and the bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast is buffet style which I’m not usually keen on, but i was pleasantly surprised how good it was, especially the omelettes cooked to order. Looking forward to a return visit in the summer."
416,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"What I can tell you from our stay, is that while a lot of these reviews will no doubt say this is not a city centre hotel, this is exactly why you should stay here for the ultimate Liverpool experience in hospitality! Just outside the city centre (but feel free to correct that Titanic Hotel!) and based at Stanley Dock, it is very clear that this historic building has the space to work with, and they do so fantastically! They provide a unique experience that a city centre hotel with limited space simply cannot! Our standard room was by far the best standard room we are ever likely to experience at any hotel! A very large room with air conditioning, coffee pod machine (!), large sofa, large coffee table, a king bed which is bigger than our king bed at home (which my partner…"
417,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"The hotel was lovely. Very nicely done out and a feeling of luxury. The rooms were well sized, and nicely furnished. The bed was comfy. Staff were helpful, friendly and professional. Location is good with only a 5-10 minute Uber from the city centre and places like Cavern Club. Would recommend for any couples looking for a nice couple of days city break."
418,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,False discription of rooms phone not working windows don’t open stand in manager offered a fan views are not as described more luck world war 3 over rated asked for a refund on second night as I don’t want to stay again and if I was anyone booking here think again avoid
419,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"We have stayed in the Titanic several times since opening and this is our first review, this was definitely our best stay!! We booked a dinner bed & breakfast package last minute for £225 ,we thought that was pretty reasonable ! Checked in about 2.00pm and went straight to our room ,a dockside superior which was absolutely huge, had cocktails in the bar then dinner in Stanleys bar & grill ,had the dockers pre set menu and all 3 courses where fantastic!!! We have eaten many times here usually Sunday lunch and this by far the best meal we have eaten there.Our server Tracy was the star!! she couldn't be more attentive to us and nothing was too much trouble!! thank you Tracy xxx We would not hesitate to recommend the same stay even the John concierge interacted with everone arriving…"
420,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"The hotel decor is lovely, in the common areas and rooms. Comfortable bed, big fluffy towels. Spotlessly clean everywhere. But chilly. You wanted to keep your coat on inside. Even in the bed rooms with the heating on.The staff were all friendly throughout the hotel. It's quite a walk to the visitor attractions and the centre of Liverpool. There is a bus which will take you but it only runs 5 times a day. Parking at the hotel is £8 for 24 hrs We went on the £225 bed breakfast and evening meal deal. You are offered a slmmed down menu. We chose steak and chicken. The steak although perfectly cooked was so tough it was well neigh impossible to cut. It had to be sent back. They were really good about it and offered to cook another one. We went for plain chicken instead which came…"
421,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"There are a lot of pluses here, the outlook on Stanley Dock, the quality of the renovation & overall a nights stay was pleasurable & enjoyable. It loses a star due to value, £255 for a night albeit including breakfast & dinner is steep. It grates that you have to pay extra for the car park & the pool/spa as well. We were upgraded to a corner superior & was impressive overlooking the dock with a huge bed & space. Lighting is ambient & subdued although some may say gloomy! Dinner was well presented & tasty enough, breakfast was fairly standard although did cater for a range of tastes & formats. So, glad we stayed & would recommend for a special occasion."
422,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"My partner and I stayed in this gorgeous hotel for our second anniversary, we had booked the “love on the docks”. Upon arrival we were greeted and all staff throughout the stay were friendly and attentive. The lady on reception upgraded our room complimentary and extended our check out which was really nice. Our room was clean, fresh towels and water in the room. They even gave us an anniversary card. We are in the Stanley restaurant for our evening meal and breakfast.. we couldn’t fault the food or service, it was amazing. We also visited the Maya Spa, it’s absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. This was just an added charge of £20pp which I would recommend. Would return, we had a lovely stay thankyou."
423,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"From the moment we got here, we quite literally were treated like first class guests on the titanic - truly an experience. We got early check in and our room was upgraded too! The staff of the front desk were extremely polite (in fact, all of the staff were). Our room was lovely and clean and had amazing views out onto the dock. I had read reviews previously about it being noisy and I slept the whole night through (I’m an extremely light sleeper). We requested a few more bottles of water for the room, after our dinner and the man at the desk sent them up straight away. Breakfast was fantastic and had a lovely variety of different items and I particularly liked the smoothies. We will definitely be returning again for my birthday (or maybe sooner!)"
424,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Had a lovely night away here with my girlfriend for her birthday. Humongous rooms with a special request packages on offer (petals and chocolate). Very good bar with huge choice of drinks, friendly staff. The hotel was immaculate and the room was amazing with the highlight being the bath/bathroom!! Will stay again. Little bit of a walk into town but only 30 mins or so."
425,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Booked on booking.com where it is not clear that although this is a spa hotel, guests cannot use the thermal pool facilities unless you pay extra and pre book. We asked to pay to use the pool upon arrival however we were told that there was no availability that day. The room was nice and big however was pretty cold. The bathroom is basic with just a shower and no bath. We were told our room had been upgraded from what we had originally booked but we couldn’t really see how it was an upgrade. We didn’t stay the night due to not being able to access the pool facilities. Previously when booking hotels on booking.com the hotel themselves have sent us lots of information about our stay before arriving so this would be useful for titanic spa as we feel very mislead. A long way to…"
426,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Had the great pleasure of staying in this stylish hotel for one night on a half board basis. The hotel and its facilities are wonderful and all the staff we dealt with were friendly and attentive. The evening meal and breakfast were of a high standard. Would recommend.
427,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"We stayed here for 2 nights for our 10 year wedding anniversary. We paid nearly £500 for 2 nights inc breakfast. Bit disappointed there were no robes or slippers provided. Used the spa which was lovely. Enjoyed the restaurant, which you need to prebook, but had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for our food. Nice cocktails at the bar. At 5am, when we were both asleep, the large picture above the bed fell and hit my face. It was a horrible experience. I called down for ice and was asked to go to reception. Considering I was in tears, my eye was swelling badly and I was in shock I found this crazy. I asked them to come to the room with the ice. The accident left me with a black eye, swollen face and pain. Not ideal when you’re planning to sightsee and eat out to celebrate. We…"
428,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"I booked this hotel because I love anything to do with the Titanic sadly this had nothing to do with Titanic apart from a desk selling keyrings, coasters and spoons it could have been any hotel, I was expecting, old black and white pictures on the walls and the White star line posters, even some old newspaper reports, nothing, the room was fine I cannot fault the room, I arrived early and sat in the odd couple of chairs they had in reception while I waited for my room to be ready, the staff behind the desk either did not realise or did not care that I could hear their conversations, they were slagging other guests and other co workers, then moaning that one of them got a good tip but the others did not, There was a young man who looked barely out of school who I asked a…"
429,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"I am very torn about this hotel as the hotel itself and the room was absolutely beautiful. However, for the price we paid, we expected the restaurant and food to be great, how wrong we were! Firstly, to reiterate, the rooms are amazing and the hotel is beautiful. However it was cheaper for us to go for the deal which included dinner and breakfast than just the room, so we went for that. If we had just stayed in the room, I'd have less complaints but unfortunately the restaurant ruined everything. Also another thing to note is the pictures of the beautiful staircase is not open to guests, only to wedding parties or conferences. We did ask at reception to see it and she said to ask concierge, but we left on the Thursday of Grand National weekend so it was very busy and after…"
430,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"This was our second visit to the Titanic hotel for my husband and I and unfortunately we aren't sure if we would stay here again. Upon arrival the carpark was completely full, having to drive around to find a parking space wasn't really good enough being hotel guests. When we finally got a parking space and checked in, our room was upgraded - my husband did request for something 'nice' to be done for me as it was my birthday weekend so thats possibly why we got an upgrade which was great however, having stayed at this hotel in 2019 we remember entering our room and music being played and our name on the TV screen - this time around no music was playing and a previous guests name was on the screen - slightly disappointing. I was going to have a bath as I remember from our first…"
431,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"A fantastic three night stay (this was our second trip to the hotel, first time we stayed one night and decided it deserved a longer revisit). Staff were professional and attentive. The room was extremely spacious and clean. We sat in the lobby/bar area on one of the days, had some fantastic food and drinks and just people watched (it's the most relaxed we have both felt in a long time)."
432,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Wow! Normally leave review writing until after an event! However this is just fantastic. Booked surprise spa stay for partner. Just had amazing time in wellness centre , complete relaxation time spent with a massage treatment followed by a couple of hours chilling in wellness centre. Pool and steam room such a lovely experience. Checked into our room 104 all added extras requested on rival and the dock view with sun shinning in room makes this a great start to an overnight stay. Looking forward to our meal in Stanley’s and a few relaxing cocktails. Anyone visiting Liverpool or who love here this hotel lives up to its reputation it’s a must! We will be back."
433,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"I really can’t see why this hotel attracts poor feedback. I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels in a lot of different countries, and I was very impressed from the minute i arrived. I will say first though that if you want a cheap hotel, book the Adelphi, this is quite an expensive hotel, (we stayed on a deal which included breakfast) and it was £165 per night, however, they say you get what you pay for. Check in staff were polite, chatty and helpful as was the guy on concierge. The breakfast was extremely good, and had everything you’d want and probably more! To be honest I’ve never seen a breakfast spread like it before. The staff in the restaurant were excellent and didn’t hassle you like some do. On arrival we sat outside with a drink which was nice to do seeing as we had some sun…"
434,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"This hotel was absolutely stunning! From the spectacular entrance, to the large, spacious rooms - this hotel has the wow factor! All of the staff were so friendly and quick to help in anyway they could. We ate in the restaurant which was equally as great. The service was fantastic and the food equally so. It was served quickly, meaning it was the perfect temperature. The cost of this hotel was completely reasonable. Only two areas for improvement. One, the toilets in the restaurant had 2 doors with broken locks. I am going to assume that the management were not aware as this was completely out of sync with the remainder of the building. Two, I tried to book a spa experience for the following day and was told that there was no convenient availability. That said, once again,…"
435,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,I Stayed here as was visiting the area for business. All staff were friendly polite and helpful. Rooms huge and comfortable with huge bathrooms as well. Cocktails were lovely although and breakfast was great.
436,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"We just got back from The Titanic, it was really fab. The hotel is classy in an industrial style, which blends well with the dock buildings. The room and bathroom were huge and very well appointed. We had dinner on the first night, the food was excellent as was breakfast. The staff are; polite, helpful and very pleasant, especially John the concierge who was smiley and super helpful. He recommended and booked restaurants for us which turned out to be really good. We really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return."
437,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"I booked a 1 night stay as a surprise for my partner and I am so glad I chose here! She is titanic obsessed so it was always going to be good but this stay just exceeded all my expectations. The lady who checked us in (I believe her name was Charlotte) was so lovely and helpful, especially when I snuck down to reception after check in to ask her to put a couple of things in the room (gift and decorations) while we were out. We had been complimentary upgraded to a Superior Double room and it was breathtaking, even the corridor was amazing….. never thought I’d be complimenting a corridor!😂 I would 100% recommend this hotel and we will definitely be back!"
438,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Rude staff at night, refused to serve us a bottle of champagne to celebrate my husbands 40th. Stated bar closes despite the 24-hour licence and people drinking still at the bar. Told can order in rooms but can't celebrate together. Doormen where hostile and threatening, more like night club bouncers. went to hit my husband hand when asking for name and if body camera on (We hoped it was). I informed door men that they was scaring me and told 'we don't care'. Spent over a £1000 on 3 rooms a meal for my family and spa. On complaint I was told that I made up my husband was even there ?? and saying we was intoxicated. When in fact we had been at a concert and last alcoholic drink was over 8 hours previous with our meal, by this point we was stone cold sober. We was just unhappy!!…"
439,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Sadly this had became a party hotel very noisy music blasting at 2am ppl screaming with what sounded like a orgy Blood on wall in bathroom Had to leave hotel at early hours in the morning Not has good as it used to be
440,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Staff offered no help when I went to the front desk to say TV and air con wasn’t working. Blood on bathroom wall! At 1am I could hear ‘adult noises’ and rave music from next door this went on till 3am when I spoke about this to the manger she told me ‘people can do what they want in their rooms’ Told I will not be offered a refund Checked out at 2:30 am as I was unable to sleep and was really uncomfortable. This was my second stay at the hotel the first time I also next door to a party. I thought maybe this was just me being unlucky. However after staying again this year I have came to the conclusion that this is a party hotel for groups NOT a relaxing hotel like it’s advertised. It attracts parties as the rooms are large but COLD
441,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Very nicely decorated Titanic Theme Hotel. Rooms are humongous and well set up. Dinner was good but the service was slow and not very attentive. Breakfast had a good quality but lacked choice other then the standard English breakfast. Location is good once the surrounding is developed but for now a bit away from the action.
442,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"From start to finish of staying at the titanic hotel, it was first class - really nice reception staff . Friendly and professional- bar staff the same - the spa exceptional- and the beds super comfortable!! We had a Brilliant stay here ! Not to far from the city centre in a taxi -"
443,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Excellent hotel . You can’t complain about anything here , the staff are lovely the rooms are big , clean and luxurious . The breakfast was great , the restaurant looked good but we didn’t get time to try it . Spa is relaxing. We will definitely be returning."
444,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Overall, family and I enjoyed our stay at the Titanic hotel. Our rooms were huge, clean and comfortable. It was great having a view out on to the river. It was also handy having the car park on the hotel grounds. We visited the spa which was lovely. The staff were mostly warm, friendly and helpful. In terms of downsides, our rooms weren’t ready on arrival at check in which meant we had to wait for a bit, but we were delighted when we saw our rooms. Breakfast was good, although it was difficult to get the attention of the staff to ask for tea and coffee. On one morning I asked the waiter for oat milk and he agreed to bring it, but then just walked away and didn’t return with it. The hotel is located about a 20 min walk from the city centre. We didn’t mind walking in and…"
445,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Top class setting and suite. Loved everything about our stay, the food, the surroundings and the staff couldn’t do enough for you. Conveniently located a short drive to the town, great view of the river and very clean."
446,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,Amazing honeymoon stay the night of our wedding. We stayed in the presidential suite and it was beautiful. We had to rush off for our afternoon flight so didn’t get to enjoy the room to the fullest however the room was amazing. Staff were helpful and congratulatory!
447,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"We were welcomed from the minute we arrived at this amazing hotel. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and we were given a complementary room upgrade on arrival, which we were very grateful for. Hotel is spotlessly clean, rooms very large and spacious and the bed very comfortable. Food at both the bar and the main restaurant was very good and reasonably priced. We would definitely return."
448,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"As soon as you walk through the door the hotel vibe is brilliant, reception and bar staff can’t do enough for you . As you leave the lift to find your room the corridors are just like your on the actual titanic, obviously before it sunk🫣 The rooms are massive and brilliantly decorated with fabulous stand alone bath and walk in shower, beds are so comfortable and clean. Can’t fault anything and anyone who does a review and moans I wouldn’t take any notice !. A brilliant experience for My Mrs an Me, even thou we only live 10 mins away from the hotel it was well worth the trip! 👌🏼"
449,Titanic Hotel Liverpool,"Lovely hotel, however no sleep from 6am, constant noise, from the lift, and it sounded like we could hear every shower, toilet flush, also had an inter connecting room by looking through the gap in the door, we could see another couple, really enjoyed our stay, but avoid room 216, I will be going back bed once home, catch up on lost sleep."
450,Somerville Hotel,"All the staff at the hotel were unfailing polite and helpful, our room was bright, clean and comfortable and the range of food at breakfast was excellent. The evening meals were very well prepared and delicious. Would recommend this hotel"
451,Somerville Hotel,"The people were so kind and helpful. The village is beautiful. The view from the restaurant are amazing. Nice team at the reseption, bar and restaurant. The rooms are clean and beautiful. Thank for the lovely stay."
452,Somerville Hotel,"Well located, decent food and staff very helpful. St Aubin is a lovely place to base yourself and rest of island is easily accessible. Would stay again, without hesitation. Weather was dry and sunny though a bit breezy. Overall, a pleasant little break."
453,Somerville Hotel,"Lovely hotel with amazing views over the bay. Although we hadn't booked a Sea View room, we were given a room (albeit very small) at the front of the hotel with a fantastic view of the harbour and bay across to St Helier which was an unexpected surprise. Will definitely stay here again on our return visit to Jersey, highly recommended!"
454,Somerville Hotel,"Our first return to Jersey for 21 years and so pleased we chose the Sommervlle for our long overdue stay. Everything was perfect, from the location, to check in, the room, breakfast, public areas, the staff, the bar area and of course the restaurant. The weather was a little off for late May, so the pool not used, but the sun loungers were perfect in a sunny spot out of the wind. All in all, this hotel has set a high standard, but not too formal, so just right for a relaxing break or week away. Would love to return one day."
455,Somerville Hotel,"holiday in jersey stopping at the somerville hotel good food excellent staff plenty to see and do while in jersey, excellent bus service for traveling around the island no need for a car and people are friendly"
456,Somerville Hotel,Nice room with sea view - a bit cramped with two large single beds joined to make a very wide double. The plumbing worked well. (Can't be said for all hotels!) Get the Dolan Group app and get 5% off food and drink.
457,Somerville Hotel,"Wonderful stay, well looked after by attentive staff, all areas very clean and comfortable, good food and so relaxing with nothing too much trouble for the staff, will return later in the year and hope for another enjoyable trip"
458,Somerville Hotel,"Lovely hotel set in a beautiful location , the views from the hotel are amazing . I would say may not be suitable for people with walking difficulties as it’s on a hill. Restaurant food was lovely and service in there and the bar was excellent . The garden is lovely , with lots of tables and chairs and a pool with sun loungers . Room was clean and ample big enough . If you need an iron call reception and they bring it straight up. Enjoyed our 3 day break and will go back again in the future ."
459,Somerville Hotel,"I have stayed a good few times at Somerville and it is always brilliant. A beautiful hotel in a wonderful setting above St Aubin’s harbour, and easy access from Jersey airport. 90 minutes after my flight took off from Gatwick, I was checking in at reception. The hotel is very elegant and beautifully laid out, the staff are excellent and it is always a pleasure to visit. I’m back again in July/Aug, it’s fab!"
460,Somerville Hotel,We arrived on Saturday afternoon and were greeted by Steve the manager who gave us an excellent briefing on the hotel and its facilities. The room was lovely with fantastic views over St Aubins bay. The pool area was fantastic great loungers. Pool towels provided. We had Sunday lunch there very nice. In addition we had the high tea which made a lovely end to our week there. Until next time.
461,Somerville Hotel,"Wonderful stay at the Somerville: lovely hotel, amazing views, great staff and service: helpful and friendly. Room was great and breakfast very nice with those amazing views!! Would love to come back in future…."
462,Somerville Hotel,Friends & I reserved a table yesterday 6 of us . Rather than us having a drink in the lounge for relaxation before our meal we’re taken to out table ( we were 6 minutes late) told in no uncertain terms we were late & needed to go straight to our table . Table wasn’t the prime position but accepted this that no window tables available. We were then advised that we needed to order food as the kitchen closed in 5 minutes! Therefore rushed into ordering . The timings of drinks/food were appalling for example 2 of the group waited 10 minutes to start their meal as their drinks hadn’t arrived. The waitress who served us had zero people skills . The others were lovely . My food was under cooked so I left most of it not wanting to make a scene or increase the time it would take .…
463,Somerville Hotel,Very enjoyable stay in a traditional hotel Great breakfast with continental selections and numerous hot options cooked to order Note that the hotel is located on a hill above the harbour and involves a short climb
464,Somerville Hotel,We stayed at the Somerville Hotel for 1 night. The hotel was clean and the staff very helpful. Breakfast was good with enough choice. The location is quiet but beautiful with great views We would stay again.
465,Somerville Hotel,"Really lovely hotel in a wonderful location with a super view. Rooms and common area are all lovely. Staff are really friendly - highy recommend this hotel and a trip to Jersey. We hired electric bikes and cycled round which fun and even if you dont want to do anything, it is just nice to sit and look at the view. I even swam in the pool which was suprisingly not chilly at all."
466,Somerville Hotel,"Exceptional welcoming and check-in following a courtesy call to say the room was ready and my luggage had been taken following my early arrival. My sea view room was modern, bright with luxury comfort and high housekeeping standards. Complimentary water, biscuits and tea and coffee making facilities were an additional welcome. Service in the lounge/bar was of a high, friendly and professional standards. Breakfast didn’t disappoint, a great selection with again faultless service. Overall, a wonderful first stay. Congratulations to team Somerville!"
467,Somerville Hotel,"Great location with view over St Aubin and only 3 mins from harbour and restaurants. Its an old time hotel nicely refurbished and popular with a good atmosphere and comfortable lounge and friendly service. 2 things let it down for us - although heated from May, the pool was still too cold to use and not covered at night so unused. We had a superior sea view room but mostly looked onto a large unattractive flat roof with a bright flood light shining in. Suggest asking for a high room away from a flood light if the view matters to you."
468,Somerville Hotel,"Great hotel on the bay of St Aubin. In village nice choice of restaurants ( Italian Sorrento and the pub). We rented bikes at Jersey Bike hire, just around the corner and had a great tour over the island."
469,Somerville Hotel,"Hotel is very beautiful, views are amazing. Location is great St Aubin is a lovely location plenty of places to eat and drink and lovely place to take a walk. Staff at hotel are all helpful and polite. Sea view room is great, nice size and amazing views. Beds are very comfortable had great night sleep."
470,Somerville Hotel,"A one night stay, meeting up with other family members. Staff and their service were excellent, great publicareas with super views across to St Helier. Not over-impressed with the food at dinner, but a good breafast menu. Room perfectly adequate for an overnight, but very warm. Would use this hotel again."
471,Somerville Hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Jersey, based at this perfectly welcoming hotel. Friendly and helpful staff, delicious breakfasts, beautiful interior, super views, fine pool, convenient and picturesque location. Highly recommend!"
472,Somerville Hotel,Amazing stay food and service excellent very friendly staff. We ate at the hotel twice on an evening and the food was amazing we also had afternoon tea which was excellent. Would highly recommend this hotel
473,Somerville Hotel,Gorgeous hotel with amazing views across the bay. Lovely decor and very comfortable rooms. The staff were genuinely friendly and we were made to feel very welcome. As a family of four we were all very impressed. I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone.
474,Somerville Hotel,"We came to Jersey for our honeymoon. 40 years later, we wanted to celebrate our Ruby wedding anniversary in Jersey. While our original hotel is no longer operational, we chose the Somerville Hotel as a result of studying their well constructed website."
475,Somerville Hotel,"Superior Double Room with Sea View - comfortable bed, quiet, spacious, good storage, nice seating area, functional ensuite. Communal areas - sumptious seating areas and plenty of them. Stunning views from the restaurant and lounge area. Staff are exceptional and an absolute credit to the hotel. Can't wait to return."
476,Somerville Hotel,"The staff at Somerville do all they can to make your stay a happy one. Rooms are comfortable if a little cramped at Classic level. If you can afford it, go for the superior rooms. The view from the front of the hotel is superb."
477,Somerville Hotel,Despite the very variable weather we enjoyed our holiday at this hotel. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. The breakfasts were lovely with a great choice and the restaurant where we had dinner on one evening was very relaxed and the food excellent.
478,Somerville Hotel,"Lovely Hotel Perfect Location Breakfast great choices including breakfast in your room if desired Bar & Bar Tenders were good, drinks a little pricey but that's Jersey for you Spectacular views Lovely Grounds"
479,Somerville Hotel,"We stayed in room 302, which was a lovely size & very quiet. Breakfast was very good, also Sunday lunch is a must…. Will definitely be back for that beautiful view & friendly staff who always greet you with a smile"
480,Somerville Hotel,Your Hotel was a pleasure return to at night and your staff and facilities left us in awe. Your room cleaning staff seemed very efficient and had attention to detail and no hesitation to any special requests. I only wish i could live in the hotel and have such service. then I'd become a spoiled brat. Thanks again.
481,Somerville Hotel,Lovely hotel with great staff and really comfy beds. Only downside is that it is up a very steep hill so if you do not have a car it could be a problem. The views are fantastic with clean well kept gardens and very clean rooms. Would stay again.
482,Somerville Hotel,"Perfect location and ambiance. A bit pricey, but worth the additional cost because of location. Breakfast was included in the price we paid and was very good. Ideally situated for a trip to St Helier (20 minutes on the bus) 15 minutes from the airport and then 15 minutes to Jersey Reds RFC. Would certainly come back if I was to visit the island again."
483,Somerville Hotel,Lovely sized rooms. We had great views of St Helier from two bedroom windows. Bed was very comfy. Public areas were good for relaxing. The hotel is decorated very pleasantly. Situated within easy reach of all attractions.
484,Somerville Hotel,"great hotel in brilliant position for exploring the island staff went out of their way to make our stay brilliant, great restaurant and great restaurants surrounding the hotel, just a 5 minute walk away."
485,Somerville Hotel,"Not impressed so far. Tiny room. You can hardly get in as the bed almost blocks the door it's so small. Nowhere comfortable to sit and window facing a wall. Basic, tiny bathroom. Not my idea of a 4 star hotel. Disappointing. Back to L'horizon next time."
486,Somerville Hotel,"We have been before (2019) and this time we expected the high standards we had before and were not disappointed. It was, however far more expensive both to stay in the hotel and to eat in the restaurant. The breakfasts were magnificent!"
487,Somerville Hotel,"I always stay at The Somerville when over on Jersey for business. Great views across St Aubyns Bay, friendly staff, breakfast is spot on and dinner superb. The public areas are comfortably and stylishly furnished. Nothing to dislike at all."
488,Somerville Hotel,Stunning view from the hotel. Fabulous staff really made us feel welcome and we felt very relaxed. I cannot think of a better hotel overall in 40 years of travelling for work and pleasure. We will definitely return.
489,Somerville Hotel,Such a great relaxing and comfortable hotel. Immaculately presented and always clean and tidy. Attentive staff who go the extra mile without being asked. Delicious food. The food is a little pricey but when averaged out with the room rates it represents good value for money.
490,Somerville Hotel,"I had my retirement dinner with 14 guests in the private garden dining room, and stayed overnight. Everything was absolutely perfect from beginning to end. incredible staff, food and service. I can’t recommend this hotel enough"
491,Somerville Hotel,"Excellent hotel, very relaxing and nothing was too much trouble.Everybody really looked after you and everyone was really friendly.Our sea view room was modern and lovely with unspoilt views of the sea and harbour the bed was super comfy.Spotlessly clean everywhere the cleaning staff are a credit.Thank you once again to Steven the manager for a wonderful stay and for being so friendly and approachable.We even extended our stay as we just were not ready to go home .....will be back soon"
492,Somerville Hotel,"Our recent 5 night stay was wonderful. The staff are great all round. Our room 316 was a sea view with a bath and shower cabinet. What made this room better than other hotels was the two beautiful arm chairs, the perfect blackout curtains, the great lighting that you could use either fully illuminated for reading or lower for a more relaxed atmosphere. Free drinking water thought the tap water is also perfect. Really fluffy white towels which you can opt to not get changed every day. Good hand wash/ shower/ shampoo etc. There are lots of different indoor and outdoor areas. The food is exquisite. The site is up a hill, but even though I am waiting on surgery for two new knees I managed it with care. The Jerset taxi app is excellent for getting you picked up at the door, and…"
493,Somerville Hotel,When ever I travel to Jersey I always try to stay in one of The Dolan Hotels and on this occasion I checked into the Somerville Hotel receiving a warm welcome again and entered my spacious room with all the amenities to make a great stay. The food whilst dining here is superb
494,Somerville Hotel,"Great staff, friendly, attentive and helpful. Excellent breakfast and evening meals. Comfortable room with all necessary amenities. A few minutes walk to the harbour and easy to catch a bus to go around the island if necessary. Great walks close by. I would return without hesitation and thoroughly recommend it to anyone considering staying in Jersey. Fabulous."
495,Somerville Hotel,Room needs modernizing; staff need assistance with training and coffee needs to be improved. It was a challenge to remove some charges on my invoice where I had been double charged. Our sea view room had a limited sea view.
496,Somerville Hotel,The hotel has an amazing view from the dining room and lounge area. It made a good base to visit the island. We had a very relaxing stay and would return. The bedroom was had good storage space and comfortable seating. There were plenty of assessable plugs.
497,Somerville Hotel,"Really impressed with the hotel, staff and breakfast. It was part of a BA holiday and offered outstanding value. Definitely recommend others to stay here. It is in a great location, although walking to the short distance to the sea front would be difficult for those with mobility issues, as the access road is steep."
498,Somerville Hotel,"I bought a Champagne Afternoon Tea in a Charity Auction, so invited 2 Ladies from Jersey Mencap who I was fundraising for. The service was exemplary from the moment we arrived. One person was a non meat eater and a special plate of sandwiches was presented especially for her. The cakes and Scones were freshly made and there was plenty tea and hot water available. We were also presented with Champagne (not sparkling wine) without having to ask for it. The view from the dining room is superb and the Hotel is a great setting for a celebratory function."
499,Somerville Hotel,"Excellent location and the room had an amazing view of the harbour. Beautiful sunset and sunrise . The breakfast had an excellent choice of food, we also chose to dine in one evening and the service and food was superb! We would highly recommend the food here."
500,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"We very much enjoyed our first holiday on Jersey. The pleasure was increased by our stay at the Pomme d'Or hotel with its friendly, helpful and efficient staff, its comfort and its facilities and its locatin."
501,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Excellent location, just minutes from the bus station, shops, restaurants. The staff were extremely helpful and cheery. Food in the cafe was very nice, as was the breakfast. Even when we had a problem with a charge to our room that wasn't ours, it was dealt with immediately. Nothing was too much bother. All staff excellent."
502,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"My room with ensuite was perfect, looked like it had been recently decorated. Excellent breakfast. Staff couldn't have been more helpful, allowed us to drop bags off early. Meeting room facilities were very handy."
503,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"The Pomme D'Orr hotel in St Helier Jersey is first class. The rooms were clean and modern with air conditioning. Room service was great, The restaurant was excellent with a wide choice of food -- always at least 2 roasts every night. Table service was excellent and the atmosphere was greatly enhanced by Duncan who stimulated a very happy approach in all his staff. The hotel is very centrally placed in St Helier and we could easily access all parts of the Island from the close by bus station with it's excellent services. I can thoroughly recommend it."
504,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Stayed here a few years ago, and always visit for a drink and a meal when we are in jersey. Went this week for dinner. It was as great as ever, good food, great service, and was able to have my phone charged"
505,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"It is one of the best hotels in St Helier. First class service and high-quality bedrooms in every respect. Last year we stayed at The Grand Jersey, this hotel is just as good and located in the heart of the town and close to the bus station. All of the staff are extremely efficient , polite, and helpful at all times. The service is second to none, and I will definitely return again"
506,Pomme d'Or Hotel,This hotel is excellent. Staff really helpful. Cleanliness and. Service throughout our stay top class. Location brilliant for bus station town centre and harbour walks . We stayed in a premier room bed and breakfast. Thank you to all concerned
507,Pomme d'Or Hotel,I had a lovely time at the pomme d’or hotel. Staff were friendly. The room was clean. I really good view from the window. I slept well. The tea and coffee facility are excellent. The room service was excellent. Thank you.
508,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Brilliant Hotel will definitely revisit. Staff very helpful and friendly food brilliant especially breakfast. The restaurant staff went out of there way. We stayed in the superior room immaculate. Thank you for a lovely break.
509,Pomme d'Or Hotel,We were delighted to stay at the historic Pomme d'Or Hotel. Close to the marina the hotel is a short walk to the Liberty bus Station from where you can visit any location on the island. The local Museum and Maritime museum are well worth a visit.
510,Pomme d'Or Hotel,We had the perfect room overlooking liberation square. The staff were quietly efficient and helpful. Nothing was a problem. There was an issue when our taxi to the airport was poached from us. Time was short but the manager offered to drive us to the airport. We did hail a passing taxi just in time.
511,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"We went to the Pomme D'Or for my wifes birthday. We had a wonderful time and they looked after us very well. The location is superb, with plenty of local bars and restaurants very close by. The breakfast is excellent, with a good selection of well prepared food, which was constntly being replenished."
512,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"This was a double header of a long service award, 40 years with my company, and a birthday getaway for my wife. All the staff at the Pomme d'Or made us very welcome and went above and beyond. From plating up the club sandwich onto two plates, as we were sharing, to wishing my wife a happy birthday with cake from front of house and also the restaurant. Treating us like royalty. Four star hotel, more like five star. Thank you to everyone."
513,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Whenever we visit Jersey (our first trip was 29 years ago) this is our preferred hotel and we were not disapointed, all the staff we encountered were so friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble."
514,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Wonderful warm welcoming place with luxury & charm. Excellent location & setting. Close proximity to Liberation square with a seating area & ice cream readily available. Short walk to beach, shops & Lily train that will take you to other parts of the island. ALL staff were extremely accommodating & are a credit to this hotel. Throughout our 7 nights stay with family, we were impressed with the prompt service, every need was catered for making us feel so valued. The entire staff were professional & with a smile on their faces. Bedrooms & bathrooms were spacious, spotlessly clean, quiet & with a very comfortable bed. We had a wonderful experience at the Pomme D’Or Hotel every staff member we encountered from reception to cleaning staff were delightful & eager to help. Thank you!…"
515,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Hotel, food , staff and cleanliness all excellent. Location great so near to all facilities. Upgraded our room to a walk in shower , bigger room with a fridge and bottled water replenished each day. Nothing was any bother with the staff . Breakfast was amazing."
516,Pomme d'Or Hotel,A great central location. Friendly very clean and our room was quiet. Needs more non dairy and vegetarian options at breakfast including nuts and seeds. There was plenty of fruit. Quite hot so the air conditioning was welcome.
517,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"This is our first stay here, for one night. Efficient and prompt check-in on arrival. Room on the small side but clean and well equipped. No views from the room to speak of. Buffet breakfast was great, wide choice. Location was excellent, on a square looking towards a harbour area, main shopping street directly behind and a 10 minute walk to the passenger ferry terminal. Check out, by 11am, was also friendly and efficient. Would stay here again"
518,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Pomme D'Or is steeped in history . Its location in Liberation Square is central with the bus station just across the road, you can get almost everywhere on the island on a bus if you have time to. As ours was a short stay we packed a lot in arriving in Jersey St lunchtime we dropped our bags in our rooms and went to St Aubin on Le Petite train stationed across Liberation Square the next day we went to the Jersey War Tunnels the next day we went on the Full Day Island tour that can be booked on the Square and the next day before we came home in the evening we went to Elizabeth castle . We packed a lot in in 3 nights and it was all great ."
519,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Great stay. Room clean. Great location in centre of St Helier. Easy walking distance to bus station and shopping. Breakfast buffet style. Disappointed with evening meal so only ate here twice. The property needs some renovation. The staff are very friendly. Would I stay here again yes for location.
520,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"This is a very nice hotel, housing a beautiful breakfast and some amazing staff. It was really lovely and with the location it's very much a gem on the coast. Close to restaurants and bar and some fabulous shopping."
521,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"This hotel made our holiday. So nice in every respect, Would stay there again and recommend to others. Location I would say has to be the best in Jersey. Easy access to a lot of the attractions and the town centre."
522,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"We stayed at the Pomme d,or for a combined stag trip and a visit to the Jersey International Motoring Event, the hotel was as ever ,welcoming, comfortable, good value and in a great location, staff are excellent in all departments and go the extra mile to make you feel at home. I would not hesitate to recommend The Pomme d’or for a visit to St Helier."
523,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Spotlessly clean and fabulous staff. Everyone made us so welcome. Lovely grand hotel, right in the heart of St Helier, 2 minutes from the bus station, 5 minutes from the beach. Our room was cleaned daily, the food was fabulous. Good value for money too. Fish & chips in the hotel is cheaper than the chippy across the road. I loved the history of the place and all the staff seem really proud to work there."
524,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"The hotel is good located in the center of St Helier. There are a bus terminal, restaurants, supermarkets and museums around the hotel, which is very convenient. The interior of the hotel has a calm atmosphere with a historical interior. The structure of the room was old, but it was well cleaned and I was able to spend comfortably. Hotel staff are polite and helpful. I would like to stay again."
525,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Excellent as always with very friendly and obliging staff especially Duncan, Carlos and Eunice in the Restaurant. The premier room is a must for the view alone.. Lots of dishes to chose from in the Harbour room which is always a pleasure to visit. Plenty to do in St Helier with lots of good shops nearby and good base to travel from by bus."
526,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"This is a fantastic hotel. Our room overlooked Liberation Square and the marina and was spacious, comfortable and spotlessly clean. All of the staff were friendly and helpful and did everything possible to ensure we had a great holiday. Location is just a couple of mins walk from the bus station, making it perfect for getting around the rest of the island. I can also recommend the Porter’s Store cocktail bar in the hotel basement, with its plush decor and amazing cocktails. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
527,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"The hotel was very convenient for the bus station, shopping and night life. The staff were excellent and the bedroom room was comfy and very clean. The room had everything you needed but was ready for a re-vamp."
528,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Our second stay at the Pomme D'or and even better than the first. We had a lovely corner room overlooking the harbour, and felt at home straight away. We appreciated the separate shower in the bathroom - the air con was easy to use and very effective - and the beds were very comfortable. Slept better than I do at home! The housekeeping staff did a good job, and the staff in general were very friendly and helpful. An easy check in and out, and lovely meals in both harbour room and cafe/bar. Handy for shops and restaurants, and very handy for the excellent bus services on the island. Will definitely be making a third visit next year."
529,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"The Pomme d'Or is a nice hotel centrally located right on Liberation Square. It’s elegant and the rooms are very quiet. There was a minor issue in the bathroom but Shaun from Housekeeping fixed the problem, and was so very pleasant, accommodating, and informative. With people like Shaun - and the very friendly front desk staff - I can recommend this hotel highly."
530,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, super staff nothing a problem for them - very friendly but professional. Food great. Rooms great. Easy to access bus station and weekly pass £35 week which is well worth it. 15 minute walk to get amphibious duck or walk over to Elizabeth Castle which is a must. Castle at Gorey Point is not to be missed. Thought there wouldn't be a lot to do on small island but didn't do it all at all - ran out of time so we will be back !!!"
531,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Excellent hotel. All of the staff were very professional and extremely competent in carrying out their duties. Hotel location is ideal for walks along the sea front and for visiting the retail shops in St Hellia . The main bus depot is minutes away so you can easily get to the numerous attractions on the island
532,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Another lovely stay at the Pomme D'Or, great staff and the hotel has the best location. Wonderful weather when I stayed, which was a bonus. Please be aware that there is a 10% service charge on drinks/food in the cafe bar and lobby bar."
533,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Pomme d’Or is a well situated hotel. Wonderful professional staff who were always available with advice and help. Food was excellent in both the main restaurant and Cafe Bar. Location is perfect for using public transport which is very good indeed. We had a wonderful holiday experience. Having holidayed in Jersey for many years at many hotels Pomme d’Or will be our place to stay in future.
534,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"We had a lovely holiday with only one real problem - the hardness of the mattress. Really awful. Definitely not a hotel for families with children, no outdoor space and no facilities. We were a couple so not a problem. Right in the middle of St Heliers so super convenient, very close to the bus station so managed easily without a car."
535,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Excellent service as previously, plus its proximity to the bus station (important for someone with a walking disability) and being able to book exactly what we wanted by telephone with the hotel's booking staff members."
536,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Liberation Square opposite the hotel is an ideal place to relax in peace and quiet and watch the world go by. Bus tours are at a rip-off price. Much easier to use the adjacent bus station and travel throughout the small island for just £2.20 per journey.
537,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Took a quick trip with my wife to see friends. Pomme D'or is in a brilliant location for transport and town. Hotel is spotless, service is great & food is excellent. We had a briiliant trip with help from very friendly staff."
538,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"If you want to be in the centre of St Helier life and walking distance of the bus station, marinas, ferries, museums and cafes then this is THE choice. Very friendly, professional staff. Excellent breakfast with lots of fruit plus a small café bar downstairs by the entrance offering lighter evening meals. The evening meal upstairs over looking the marina is costly for a carvery. But that is personal choice. The staff as across the Pomme team are first rate. A hotel for a special treat, but to sit and people watch dander onto Liberation Square to enjoy a Jersey ice cream The Pomme has no area for guests to sit out. Instead you have all the joys of central St Helier including two major museums. First time in Jersey, but hope to be back and in the Pomme. Loved the sound finish…"
539,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"When we arrived at the hotel we were told by reception that they would call when our room was ready, the call never came. Breakfast is shambolic if there is a coach party staying. The night before our departure we were told that there would be a slight disturbance from planned works at 8 am the following morning. At 7.20am a large hydrolic jibbed crane appeared directly outside our room making excessive noise. These works must have been planned in advance and we should have been informed at check in as we would have asked to move rooms or hotels for our final night. We asked to speak to the duty manager on 2 occasions, he was reluctant to speak to us, was very dismissive of our complaint and told us to email the complaint in!! Having spent time in many four/five star hotels…"
540,Pomme d'Or Hotel,I am an older lady looking for a holiday in good hotel with pleasant surroundings.I was unaware of amount of traffic and noise I would experience.I also did not expect to be in a busy business area. Although shopping centre was close by which was good
541,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Well-situated , clean, the service was excellent but the room was not quiet enough ( very noisy machines running all day long on the roof - room on the fifth floor) - excellent breakfast - nice and respectful employees"
542,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Staff really nice the rooms are very clean and the food was 10/10 thank you so much also best location to stay at everything is there what you need beach shops food best hotel in jersey by far would recommend it
543,Pomme d'Or Hotel,From the moment we arrived at the hotel everything about our stay was perfect. A lovely bedroom which was immaculately clean and comfortable. We ate in the main restaurant on our first night and were lucky enough to be served by Duncan who was at “the top of his game”. He made our first evening very memorable and we will not forget his friendly professionalism. What a lucky hotel to have Duncan on their team. The food was delicious and equally as good in the Cafe Restaurant for something lighter. Fabulous hotel all round. Highly recommended.
544,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"This hotel is well located in Liberation Square, with good access to local restaurant and shops. The hotel is quite traditional, but given that there is no spa or swimming pool was quite expensive for just a room. The staff were excellent and very friendly, but one of the reasons we chose this hotel was for the Friday Fish Night, which was highly recommended and was still advertised on the website - when we arrived, we found out thar the theme has been changed to an Asian night. We enjoyed our stay, but would probably choose somewhere more contemporary next time."
545,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"The shower was fantastic as far as I was concerned however my other half would have appreciated a bath ! We were particularly interested in the Liberation Day celebrations and the Pomme D'Or Hotel is clearly the best place to be in Jersey for that. It was a wonderful experience, weather wasn't that great but that didn't matter. Looking forward to getting back in the Summer. Thanks."
546,Pomme d'Or Hotel,Very calm and welcoming environment. We were asked many times if we were happy or needed anything. Vikas made sure we were well looked after and it was an amazing afternoon tea. Also got a great deal on price from Quidsin so all together a great anniversary celebration 🎉 Thank you
547,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Very friendly and helpful staff at the hotel. Breakfast and Dinner at Harbour Room versatile, well prepaired and presented. Rooms and whole Hotel always very clean. Rooms to Wharf Street unfortunately very noisy at night."
548,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"Ideally situated in the heart of Liberation Square, the food, staff and rooms were all excellent. Duncan is outstanding and ensured our stay was perfect. The hotel has two restaurants which are really good. As part of the Seymour group a stay at the Pomme d’Or allows you to use the facilities at the sister hotel, The Merton."
549,Pomme d'Or Hotel,"all very good no complaints we would visit again if holidaying in jersey ,we may well visit another year when the motor racing is taking place.....and weather is better for water activities and sun bathing ."
550,Hotel Brooklyn,"Nice looking and stylish hotel in a great location; however, a little pricey for what it is in my opinion. Even though it is a relatively new hotel, some of the decor in our room was already starting to look a little tired. No options given to upgrade to breakfast on check in which was a little disappointing. Would also expect more amenities in the room for a 4 star hotel. Overall a nice enough stay for a one night trip but nothing special. Disappointing as I booked for my husbands 30th and not even a note left in the room to say happy birthday."
551,Hotel Brooklyn,"Really impressed. Stayed one night as we were attending a gig nearby and everything was great. Check in was smooth with our room being ready on arrival. Rooms are nice and spacious and very quiet, did hear a sound the whole stay. Had a few drinks in the bar when we returned for the evening and breakfast the following morning. Food was great with plenty of options. All staff from the chef to the reception team were really friendly and welcoming. We originally booked to stay back in November 22 but I unfortunately got covid the day we were due to check in, staff were fantastic at rescheduling the booking for us so last minute and kept the date open until we decided when to change it to. All changed over at no extra cost which was amazing! Thanks so much!"
552,Hotel Brooklyn,"Stayed one night on business trip. The hotel is very modern and central, only 10 mins walk from the train station. The conference room on the top floor was spacious with lots of natural light which is great when you are set for a long day. My criticism is good. We had lunch which was awful- lots of brown sandwiches and chips. So not healthy. Breakfast selection was also poor. Scrambled eggs were cold. Coffee from the machine wasn’t great either."
553,Hotel Brooklyn,"The room was fine, but the prices of the food and beverage were a complete joke! After being informed that items on the restaurant menu (seemingly each choice I wanted to eat) was out of stock, I settled for 3 starters as my meal. Two servings of spring rolls (4 snack size rolls) and a portion of cod cheeks (3 bits of fish each smaller than an Oxo cube) were accompanied by two glasses of white wine. I took a glass of red to my room to enjoy while I worked for the evening. I signed the restaurant bill without reading it .... BIG mistake! The total bill was £80!! The wine was £17.50/glass. Adding insult to injury, breakfast was another £17.50. So £100 in extras for really nothing special or of any quantity. Never again."
554,Hotel Brooklyn,"Great location, lovely hotel, friendly staff. Only down side is you have to pre book parking in nearby Q park to obtain a discount, I did not know this and my parking charge was £32. I’m not sure was as well advertised on the website or pre visit emails as it should be."
555,Hotel Brooklyn,"Can highly recommend this hotel. Stylish, clean and didn't blow the budget. Only one criticism was we couldn't manage to get any of the films on demand to play in the room. The restaurant was excellent too. The location in Manchester was just what I wanted."
556,Hotel Brooklyn,"Good hotel with good facilities. Rooms are well equipped and well thought out. Beds are big and comfortable and the room was warm and quiet- just what we wanted. There was some dust in the room, which made us wonder if the room had been cleaned as well/recently as it should have. To be fair, apart form the dust, the room was generally clean. We paid extra for a ‘City View’ room but the rooms lacked a city view as such because it was so low down we only had a view of the shops opposite. This let the room down a little as we were expecting actual city views which would have probably been the case a few more floors up. The additional charge for ‘City View’ which we didn’t really have, meant the room price was creeping up a little and made us wonder the true value of the room cost.…"
557,Hotel Brooklyn,"Nice enough room, very comfy bed, good bathroom, nice reception staff but I could get those things in most hotels. We paid for breakfast because we thought an American themed hotel would have a good one, but that was really disappointing. The only fruit salad was a bit of sliced watermelon, the only bread was white or brown standard pre-sliced loaf, no pancakes, completely standard cooked stuff, a few small pastries which we only found after a good search, tucked away between the coffee machines in drawers. The photos on the in-room TV slideshow advertised pancakes and eggs Benedict for breakfast - these were certainly nowhere to be seen. In the room, the bedside table had drink rings from previous customer, the shelf above the bed was very dusty and the air con wouldn't switch…"
558,Hotel Brooklyn,We had a good time in Manchester. Hotels location perfect for nightlife and shopping. Staff where friendly and helpful. Rooms came with good facilities and the shower was the best. Manchester venues don't all accommodate Hen Parties. We went to Peaky Blinders and the Blues Kitchen who do and had a briliant time at both.
559,Hotel Brooklyn,I recently stayed here for a works conference in the city. The hotel is a short walk from Manchester Piccadilly station and easy to find. You have the option here of either checking yourself in using the touch screen or going old school and checking in at the desk. I picked a busy time for the reception team so used the self check in - have to say it’s pretty straight forward and I had no issues with it - instructions are self explanatory. I had a room on the first floor which benefitted from a private balcony/terrace - shame it was raining so didn’t get to use it much. Room was very clean and the bed was comfortable- plenty of power sources so I could work. The standout of the room was the walk-in rainfall shower - amazing. I ate in the hotel restaurant and I certainly didn’t…
560,Hotel Brooklyn,"Me and my partner have stayed in this hotel twice now and really enjoyed it both times. We really loved the aesthetic of the hotel. The rooms are lovely and clean, and really well looked after. The location of the hotel is also excellent. The staff are really friendly which always makes a stay at a hotel much more comfortable. The breakfast is delicious too with plenty to choose from. Would recommend and would 100% come back if we ever are staying in Manchester again."
561,Hotel Brooklyn,Superb attentive service from the moment we arrived. Neil on reception was very welcoming and super helpful (saving my car from a traffic warden). Excellent room with great Brooklyn detail. Cocktail list is great and good value. Great decor in and around bar area. Will definitely come here again.
562,Hotel Brooklyn,"Fantastic stay at Hotel Brooklyn whilst in town for the night! Lovely, welcoming and helpful front desk staff. Great local knowledge from Alex for a breakfast recommendation. Perfect location to walk to from the station and placed right in the central part of Manchester. Stunning, modern, large rooms feeling boujee and comfortable at the same time, spotlessly clean. Would definitely stay again when next in town!"
563,Hotel Brooklyn,Upon departure reception did ask how my stay was - but I was in a rush to catch a train and was feeling a bit tired so I think I just said 'yes' and scurried off so I thought I'd do a proper review to share my experience Good: * Location - right in the city centre - plenty of places to eat/drink nearby - close to station - couldn't fault * The room was huge * Nice toiletries - The White Company * Robe and slippers * SMEG Mini fridge in room * Nice big bath * Comfy Bed * Waters provided and restocked in room * Good quality biscuits provided in room * Cocktails were delicious To Be Improved: * Tea/Coffee assortment in room - attention to detail - there were random amounts of tea and coffee - it hadn't been organised properly and wasn't presentable - the brown sugar was never…
564,Hotel Brooklyn,Went to the Fawtly Towers Experience. What a fabulous way to spend a few hours. The hotel staff were great in supportingvthe event & obviously had to fit in with scripted show and the characters. The hotel is beautifully presented. A credit to Manchester
565,Hotel Brooklyn,"This was an attractive, stylish hotel that was well located in the city centre. The rooms were spacious and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom and White Company products were also great. However, we chose this hotel as a luxury stay at over £200 for one night (a Saturday). For this price, I expect everything to be spot on or for any issues to be dealt with. When we got back after a night out the room was too hot. We tried to turn the air conditioning temperature down but the digital device in the room was not working. It would not even turn on so I called reception and was told that they could manage it from a central point. Then someone came to the room just as I was falling asleep, looked at the monitor and again said that they would turn the temperature down from a…"
566,Hotel Brooklyn,"We stayed at Hotel Brooklyn for 2 nights this weekend. The hotel is gorgeous and very modern, great location too, China Town a 2 minute stroll and the theatre isn’t much more than 5 minutes walk. The room was well equipped and the bed really comfy. Also extremely quiet for a city centre location. All the staff were welcoming, the hotel bar is a bit pricey, £13.49 for a glass of wine but that was the only fault I could find, and that’s being picky! Would definitely stay here again 😊"
567,Hotel Brooklyn,"I stayed in the hotel, Brooklyn for two nights Saturday and Sunday. The staff were very welcoming and the service was 2nd to none. I just had to small problems. Overall, I would recommend the hotel. The bed is comfortable the restaurant had great service, the housekeeper was lovely it was just room 426 had a couple of maintenance niggles. I admit I should’ve report these immediately, however, I discovered both of them at times which was inconvenient to do so, and they are things that should’ve been right The first one was the shower the controls meant the shower is the freezing or boiling, no in between and no comfortable temperature. The second was the air conditioning. Set at 26C the temperature of my room did not increase. i got a chair see if there’s any hot air…"
568,Hotel Brooklyn,"Hotel decor is lovely when you first walk in , staff seemed nice on the desk especially the morning staff who got me a plaster for my toe , the bedroom was nice but they didn’t seem to restock the coffee area between guests but wasn’t worth complaining about , my main issue was the noise ! Some humming noise in the room not sure if a unit was above the room or what but I probably slept 3 hours max , left feeling exhausted , I’m very glad this was paid for as a buy a gift voucher otherwise I would of felt ripped off I couldn’t of stayed more than 1 night , the complimentary breakfast was nice lots of choices , overhaul not a bad experience but a tiring one"
569,Hotel Brooklyn,"A really nice room 3/4 bed, good hospitality tray, Nesspresso machine, a fabulous shower with White Company toiletries. I ate in the restaurant which, although not cheap, serves excellent food with really pleasant efficient service. I left for an early flight so cannot comment on breakfast. I will definitely stay there again!"
570,Hotel Brooklyn,"From the outside, the building is aesthetically pleasing. And as you enter it just gets better. The staff are friendly, happy, polite, cant do enough for you. We were incredibly lucky and got a complimentary upgrade to what must have been the best room in the hotel. A suite which had character and comfort. Clean, airy, just beautiful. The breakfast was excellent. Well cooked hot options, so much to choose from - full English, cerial, pastries, fruit, more juice choices than I've ever seen. The bar was good, they had a Dj one evening who played some belters. The atmosphere on the bar was lively but not too much. Lovely quirky decor. Everywhere immaculately clean. I cant speak highly enough of our two night stay there. Absolutely perfect. Thanks to the team that made it…"
571,Hotel Brooklyn,"Great hotel, fun theme. We booked a room with a terrace as we travelled with a small dog, room was a great size & had everything we needed. (Including a doggy bed & bowls ☺️) cocktails at the bar were fantastic & all the staff made us feel very welcome with our dog Bailey. Hotel is right by Chinatown with lots of places to eat. We didn’t eat at the restaurant but we will definitely be back & plan on eating there as it looks amazing. Thanks to Hotel Brooklyn & all the team for a great stay 😊"
572,Hotel Brooklyn,We stayed at Hotel Brooklyn for my wife’s birthday and theatre visit (The Lion King @ The Palace Theatre - very good!). The hotel staff were all great; very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent both for dinner and at breakfast. The place was spotless. For us the location was great being a few minutes walk from the theatre. Would definitely stay here again.
573,Hotel Brooklyn,"Fab hotel in east walking distance to the centre and Piccadilly station. Breakfast was great with lots of choice and the service was lovely, nothing was too much I would highly recommend and stay here again!"
574,Hotel Brooklyn,"I can’t speak highly enough of this hotel. The staff here are so super lovely and can’t do enough to help. We’ve stayed in a lot of hotels across the country and this is by far the best for friendly, helpful staff. The hotel is very clean, cool and has a fab ambiance. I just love it here 💗 Thank you Brooklyn hotel staff, you are totally Lovely"
575,Hotel Brooklyn,"Really surprised how much we enjoyed our stay here! Part of an experience voucher with a Thai cookery class. Situated next to Chinatown, with good US teeming throughout. Room was the entry level, but with very comfy bed, good facilities and nice bathroom. Large bar and restaurant with seated area to watch massive TV screen for sport etc. Breakfast was a traditional English self serve, generous and good. Would definitely use as a hotel to stop over in Manchester!"
576,Hotel Brooklyn,"Recently returned from a 2 night business stay at Hotel Brooklyn. First time visit for me. On arrival at 3.30, there was a small queue for the reception desk, so I opted to use the self-service terminals, which were easy & quick to use. I was allocated a room on the 4th floor (414). The room was clean and well equipped & had all the amenities I needed. The room had an extremely comfortable bed. One of the most important attributes of a hotel is to be able to provide a good night's sleep. On this point, the hotel succeeded. Similarly, a great breakfast is key. Again, this was excellent. You help yourself and I was more than content with the quality of the items on offer. I genuinely enjoyed my stay. I was however, interested to read some comments about staff's treatment of its…"
577,Hotel Brooklyn,"I stayed here this weekend with my girlfriend for a special occasion and I have to say I’m quite disappointed. The hotel’s facilities were great and I couldn’t fault them. However from the first member of staff we met at check in we were disappointed. We’re both 21 and are quite young looking and the way the receptionist spoke to us and the tone made us feel unwelcome - not the best first impression. Then the next morning we went for breakfast and the person ticking the sheet off of room numbers was rude towards us, it was even more of a suprise to see how different the interactions were between him and older guests. All the other staff we interacted with were nice but these 2 interactions stuck out to us after seeing the way the spoke to other and older people. I’ve…"
578,Hotel Brooklyn,"Friendly staff and atmosphere, hotel in a great location and parking close by , would definitely recommend and stay at this hotel again, we parked at Q Plaza which had 25% discount voucher and just 2 minutes away from the hotel"
579,Hotel Brooklyn,"Perfectly situated Hotel in Manchester. Stayed with my partner for 2 nights. Lovely clean hotel, decent bed and tea making facilities. Fridge, iron, hairdryer in room. Shower was amazing. Staff at check in were friendly hotel had a lovely smell to it. Used the bar facilities, good chill out space. Would definitely stay here again and recommen it to others. Please note that this hotel has no parking (we were informed of this beforehand). The Q park piazza is across the road but took us 20 mins to get into it due to road works. The cost was £60 for two days and the car park isn't secure and the car was broken into. Look for secure parking close by."
580,Hotel Brooklyn,"Couldn’t fault it, great room, location and breakfast. Great value too. Much better than big brand similar price point hotels. I would recommend staying here. Great to get local discounted parking too especially in a city centre location."
581,Hotel Brooklyn,I stay quite a lot at hotel Brooklyn it’s in a great location the hotel itself is fantastic from the large spacious rooms to the amenities to the regular staff who work there especially Mark who is always front of house welcoming guests day or night it’s always good to see a friendly face who remembers your name more hotels would definitely benefit from this kind of service but I don’t know if you can find another Mark
582,Hotel Brooklyn,"We have just checked out from Hotel Brooklyn & I can't recommend this hotel enough... clean, modern, comfortable, fantastic staff & a great breakfast. It is perfectly located within walking distance to everything you can possibly want. We can't wait until we can visit here again and will always choose this hotel for our future stays in Manchester."
583,Hotel Brooklyn,"Amazing hotel with a central city location, everything is within walking distance! Staff are friendly and helpful, the hotel is very clean and smalls amazing! The hotel is also very secure with your own key for entry! I would recommend staying here to anyone interested in staying in Manchester, I can’t wait for my next stay! Thanks"
584,Hotel Brooklyn,"Great hotel, staff were really polite and friendly . Swift check in and up to the room, room was a twin on the third floor and more than comfortable for our one nights stay. Beds were really comfy and we didn't hear much in terms of other guests coming and going which is a bonus to getting a good night's sleep. Negative was the fire alarm going off at 2am which woke us up in a panic but false alarm. Breakfast was great, good choice which was constantly topped up if running low, friendly staff and the place in general was very clean and tidy. Overall would recommend!"
585,Hotel Brooklyn,"A group of us all stayed at the hotel for a friends birthday. We could not fault our stay, Staff were friendly and attentive, the rooms were lovely, spotless and the bed very comfy! The Breakfast buffet was good with lots of variety. In addition, The smell throughout the hotel was heavenly which was a lovely touch. The location was spot on too, we’d definitely stay here again!"
586,Hotel Brooklyn,"We booked Hotel Brooklyn for a company event. There were 33 of us in total. Check in/ out was quick and efficient despite there being so many of us. We had lunch in the restaurant which we had allocated an hour and a half for due to going on to an event elsewhere and it went so smoothly! Lucas and the rest of his team were very friendly and the chef did a great job cooking for so many people at once! The hotel is lovely, clean and stylish and the rooms are just perfect. I can't think of a single negative! We all had a fantastic stay and I'm sure I speak for all of us when I say we would love to return in the future! Thanks so much for a great stay! From all of us at ByteSnap Design!"
587,Hotel Brooklyn,"I orgainsed meeting space, accommodation and dinner at this hotel and I was not disappointed with any of it. Location is great - 5 min walk from Picadilly station. Bedrooms in excellent shape and I got a great night's sleep (unusual for me when I stay away). Natalie and Phoebe were brilliant with communication leading up to the event and Coral and Lorna were so attentive on site. Meeting space is really nice with lots of windows (it's on the 9th floor). Food was yummy and all the staff (reception/restaurant/bar) were friendly, professional and helpful. Really pleased with everything and will definitely be back."
588,Hotel Brooklyn,"Check in was smooth and very friendly, I had a room on the 3rd floor, I was allocated a club double and the space was massive in the room, the views were of the back of canal street. The shower area and amenities are amazing, the room was very comfortable. The only down point were the pillows, they were very poor, very lumpy and not really up to the standard of the rest of the hotel. The communal areas in the hotel are really fresh and clean. The breakfast was great, if not a bit small on the continental side, I would have been expecting more fruit, cheese, ham etc. I often use Hilton hotels and this property is a double of what you would get under their “Currio” brand, it’s elegant, chic and trendy in one. I would definitely stay here again."
589,Hotel Brooklyn,"An excellent stay at the Hotel Brooklyn - the team are first rate, the rooms are amazing with the most comfy bed. Breakfast - spot on! great location for the city centre - can't wait until we can return."
590,Hotel Brooklyn,It was a wonderful experience strying at the hotel. The room was very relaxing and nice. It was also easy to walk around the city from the hotel. I would definitely go back whenever I am back in Manchester again.
591,Hotel Brooklyn,"Fabulous hotel. Central location, clean thoughout. The staff were wonderful nothing was too much trouble. Amazing breakfast the next morning, plenty of choice from pastries,fruit,cereals to full hot brekafast. Would definitely return."
592,Hotel Brooklyn,"First time at Hotel Brooklyn, and can't wait to come back. Staff all friendly and welcoming, especially Neil. Our room was amazing, bed so comfortable. Breakfast was stunning and thoroughly recommend. Can't wait to come back to Manchester and stay at Brooklyn again and again."
593,Hotel Brooklyn,"This was our second stay at Hotel Brooklyn and was every part as good as our first, with the improvement that the bathroom window has been painted out which made the stay more comfortable for my partner. The rooms are excellent, breakfast very good and the staff are excellent too. Slight issue with room 819 which I forgot to mention on checkout that the bathroom smelt a little damp. We will return the next time we stay in Manchester"
594,Hotel Brooklyn,"Not sure if this is a ploy to obtain money from you in the hope you might think it’s a bar charge or hotel charge. I did not see any notice to say you’re welcome to take shampoo and we will charge you later (manager’s words) all seems a bit odd to me. Nor would I ever take anything from a hotel without confirming this was allowed. Stayed here purposely because we’ve stayed before and had a wonderful time. The hotel is lovely and unusual and the staff who work there are very helpful and friendly. This review is simply down to the after-stay service, higher management and absurd polices. I’ve taken a month to decide to write this negative review, because I don’t really leave them. However, I cannot get over how I was made to feel and if I had been given an apology I would not…"
595,Hotel Brooklyn,Great staff. Great food great room. Overall all location great too. I stayed here for 2 nights knee new years. From check in the staff were lovely. The staff really make the hotel as the experience was amazing. Even in the restaurant very attentive. The rooms are big and spacious and lovely big shower
596,Hotel Brooklyn,"We booked this hotel as we had tickets for the Palace theatre. Hotel was a short walk from the venue so ideally situated , Check in was straight forward and we found the room to be modern and clean. We sat in the bar area after the show and this had a lovely atmosphere and was well staffed. Breakfast was buffet style and was a typical hotel breakfast which set us up for the day. Thanks for a lovely stay"
597,Hotel Brooklyn,Thank you for a great stay during a busy Christmas period. Stayed in the Governor room which was very nice. Needs some tlc in places but we had a great break. Would definitely stay again. We enjoyed breakfast and loved the bar in the evening time. All staff were great.
598,Hotel Brooklyn,"The hotel itself was lovely - amazing decor, friendly reception, clean and tidy. The room was large (accessible room) and things like electric closing curtains were a novelty. However huge issue when using the shower- it was a wet room and the drain was blocked so after running shower for as little as 30 seconds the whole floor of the bathroom was wet. After a full shower you needed wellies!! Asked reception to sort it, maintenance team said they did but it was worse. When checking out the manager was not willing to compensate or offer anything other than “ when you are here next time stay with us and will make sure you get a nice room”. The coffee machine also leaked all over the desk so could be used. It didn’t spoil our trip but was not what was expected for a 4 star…"
599,Hotel Brooklyn,"My husband booked us in here for a pre Christmas treat. We had tickets for a concert, and he decided to upgrade to this place rather than the usual Premier inn/travelodge. We were not disappointed! The room was impeccably clean, modern, and had everything we needed - the robes and slippers were a lovely touch. We had a city view room, and the view was amazing. The staff were brilliant, and nothing was too much trouble. The bar staff are responsible for my hangover the following day, as their cocktails were to die for! We'd also like to give the concierge, Mark, a special mention for making us feel so welcome. He really is an asset to the place, and we look forward to seeing him again next time we stay."
600,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"My family of four visited London the week before the King's coronation and stayed in connecting rooms at the Hotel Athenaeum, and it was perfect. The location is directly across the street from Green Park, so we walked everywhere (except for the Towerr of London, for which we rode the Tube from the Green Park line). All other neighborhoods were within a 1-2 mile radius of the hotel. We walked to Soho, the National Gallery, the West End, Buckingham Palace (daily b/c it's a walk across the park), Westminster Abbey/Churchill Museum/Parliament and Hop On/Hop Off (which is what we used to visit Notting Hill). Upon our arrival, check-in was smooth and our bags were delivered to our rooms. Our guaranteed connecting rooms were in the residence part of the hotel, which worked out…"
601,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"This is hands down my absolutely favourite hotel ever. I have enjoyed 3 stays at this hotel now and all 3 have been nothing but impeccable! The staff are attentive, helpful and very friendly. Nothing is ever too much for the staff and the rooms are all beautiful. I would recommend The Athenaeum to everyone who is looking for a fab hotel for a London visit. Im very much looking forward to my next visit already!"
602,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"The hotel and staff were fabulous during our stay. The beds and pillows were comfortable and the location is great. Nice place to stay when in London, Green Park is right across the street and train access is just down the street."
603,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"overall rating of this property of The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences excellent location, quite hotel, clean, kind and patient staff, I was stay with my friend and we enjoy in our staying every things was perfect service clean sleep quality and the view of our room, also the concierge very polite and helpful and hope to visit again"
604,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"We stayed at this hotel for my birthday weekend and was not disappointed at all. The staff were extremely welcoming and a special shout out to Matiusz, the Doorman, who is an absolute credit to the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable and all the little extras were provided. The bar area was very pleasant with great service. We will definitely return hopefully soon. Thank you for making my birthday extra special 😘"
605,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"was only there one night( for a reunion ), but found the experience most pleasing.The room was very clean and complimentary snacks and drinks provide. I not know what mattress they use but I can honestly say it was one of the best sleeps I have ever ever had!! I wish the stay could have been longer as I had the impression nothing was too much and lots of smiling staff."
606,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Our family arrived Athenaeum Hotel after a 5 hour flight delay. We had been up the whole night - including our grandsons 7 & 10. The Staff at the Athenaeum was so welcoming. They were great. The boys loved the bunk beds in their room. We all liked our rooms. We ate breakfast as a family and the Staff again was very accommodating. The hotel is in a good location and the boys especially loved the park across the street. It gave them a chance to run a bit. A lovely boutique hotel.
607,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"We really love this hotel. The staff is always very friendly and helpful, the room was very lovely and the breakfast is nice too. The location is great, because there are 3-4 bus stops, in front of the entry door."
608,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"If you’re after a relaxing luxurious break in London then this is the place. We stayed in one of the townhouses with its own entrance which gave us the flexibility to come and go as we pleased. The views from the View were spectacular - Big Ben, The London Eye, Walkie Talkie building and the Gherkin to name but four. Happy memories"
609,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Highly recommend! Beautiful hotel on a beautiful street. So much to do and see within walking distance. Quick walk to the underground tube. Enjoyed breakfast and afternoon tea there. Everyone was very warm and personable. Really enjoyed our stay at the Athenaeum.
610,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,From booking to leaving the hotel our stay was truly special . Travelling with my pregnant daughter for a night away we were made to feel very relaxed . Every single member of staff were friendly and seemed genuinely happy at work . A special mention to the lady in the champagne rooftop bar for her beautiful smile and welcome. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a treat . Thanks also to Elly for reply promptly to my email requests.
611,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"The hotel is by no means typical and is quite quirky, in a good way. Very comfortable rooms - especially the bed and ambience are one of being in a friendly environment where you are encouraged to feel relaxed after enjoying London. The team are very personable in the main with just one exception found in the bar with one member of staff, on two occasions. We have given feedback direct to the hotel that this did not add to the brand reputation. This was a shame as the other member of the team here was great and a true asset, but regrettably this individual was only on duty on our last night. Location is great and breakfast very enjoyable with again very pleasant service. All in all, we found it to be a good visit and believed the staff when they wished us ""have a good…"
612,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"We had the pleasure of staying at The Athenaeum, a POB property. From arriving to leaving the experience was wonderful, every member of staff we met was friendly and really helpful. Check in was efficient, informative and very welcoming. Our room was lovely, comfortable with everything you needed. We ate in 116 the food at dinner and breakfast was excellently cooked and well presented, portion sizes were large. The location of the hotel is also excellent. We look forward to our next visit. Thank you Athenaeum, some lovely family memories made!"
613,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"This was my 3rd stay at The Athenaeum. Here are the pros and cons: PROS: 1. Excellent location in Mayfair which allowed us to walk to many shops and tourist attractions. 2. Clean and stylish. 3. Ask for access to The View, their top floor lounge which has views over Green Park. Complimentary tea/coffee are served 24/7 and a happy hour of sorts takes place from 5-6 pm. CONS: 1. The Front Desk staff seemed very new and untrained. We were not given a King Bed as promised when booking and the Front Desk Clerk overcharged my credit card by GBP 500. I had to go back downstairs and speak with the Manager to ask to move rooms and have my credit card refunded. 2. The lighting in our room was bizarre. There were seemingly 2 choices given their elaborate electronic lighting system. All…"
614,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"On arrival, all the staff were so welcoming and throughout until we left. Anna, who checked us in showed us to our room and gave a rundown of the facilities in the room. Had a fantastic view of the park, with a great seating area by the bay window, ideal for taking in all the buzz of London when you had a few moments too ! The room was really comfortable (especially the bed) and stylish and I particularly liked the artwork ! The bar was really relaxing after a long day out and the barman was more than happy to make cocktails that were not listed. Had a full english for breakfast and it was just the right amount to set you up for the day. Location of The Athenaeum is ideal for sightseeing without having to jump on buses or the tube. I would highly recommend this hotel and…"
615,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"From start to finish an excellent experience. Every member of staff we encountered from check-in to check-out was so friendly and helpful, understated first class service. The room was superb, beautiful view out over Green Park, all the amenities you would expect and probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. Really well located and lots of good tips on what to do from the concierge. Will definitely be back!"
616,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Very responsive, friendly yet professional staff! Food was fantastic - full English breakfast was perfect (not the big greasy plate) and the in-house steak for room service dinner was melt in the mouth. Concierge also gave a great recommendation for afternoon tea at short notice on Mother’s Day w/end which worked out perfectly for our group (thank you!!). And Trish who was the manager was super helpful and friendly too. Rooms had a great view over the park to Buckingham palace and the hotel was in a great central location"
617,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Arrived at the hotel and was met with the warmest of welcomes by the friendly staff. Once checked in we was shown upto our room and was told to leave our luggage which would be brought up to our room for us. Never experienced that sort of service before. The room was amazing and comfortable and the little extra touches were great ie bathrobes and slippers. We had an amazing stay and can’t wait to return for our next visit.
618,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Great location wonderful staff so friendly and helpful, highly recommend this hotel. A great room with views love the teddy bear, a nice touch in the room. Concierge so helpful great tips where to go and directions. Food and afternoon tea lovely good hotel great facilities highly recommend."
619,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Second time at this hotel. Returned because of the exceptional service. This time we decided to take our little dog because we realised last time round that the hotel is dog friendly. The service for little pooches was outstanding, the team made such a fuss of him, especially Kim. We were able to have a table at the front of the restaurant area so he could be with us while we had breakfast. You don’t find that often. There was a dog bed and bowls etc waiting in our room on arrival. The hotel is just across the road from Green Park so we had an amazing walk with our dog. London has always seemed dog unfriendly to me but the team here have certainly changed my opinion on that front, well done, we will definitely be back!"
620,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"The best nights sleep ever! The hotel was welcoming from the moment we stepped inside. Friendly and professional staff. Nothing was too big of an ask. My husband and I enjoyed a weekend away celebrating his 40th and to say we had a lovely stay is an understatement. Midnight order of drinks, breakfast in bed, it simply made for a memorable birthday and the best stay we have had in a hotel. The hotel was super stylish and the artwork kept me entertained for hours."
621,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,The staff at this hotel were most welcoming from reception to bar staff and restaurant staff The bar staff were particularly knowledgeable with regards to the drinks they served. Concierge was very helpful in arranging reservations for dinner. The rooms were very clean and cosy. We will definitely return
622,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,My husband and I had a lovely 2 nights stay as his birthday treat. Beautiful room overlooking Green Park. Great location. Easy to get to the sights in London either walking or by bus. Very close to Buckingham Palace. The food was excellent especially the beef in the evening meal. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. Hopefully we will return again.
623,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Wonderful ambiance and fantastic staff make The Athenaeum a very special place to stay. From a drink in the bar on arrival to the wonderful breakfast. Really couldn’t fault the stay. The location is perfect for exploring London and the rooms quiet for a great nights sleep. Just perfect.
624,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"This is a beautiful hotel. Excellent location - right opposite the park and a stone's throw from the luxury end of town - Bond Street, Fortnum's, The Ritz.... The staff really know about customer service, we would echo the comments about Chris on reception - really helpful, knowledgeable and exceptionally professional. Our room was wonderful, with a really comfortable bed and superb amenities. The bar is cosy, just the place for a late-night cocktail and the art throughout the hotel is a very special feature - definitely worth taking it all in. Breakfast was very tasty, with a wide choice of main dishes included; augmented with a decent buffet to cater for all tastes. We also had scones in the afternoon and they came with one of the most extensive range of teas that I have…"
625,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"This was a surprise weekend to London for my Mum’s 60th birthday. My brother and I had saved a lot of money for this gift and unfortunately we were underwhelmed. Our top grade apartment had an annoying ticking sound all night and our room service breakfast arrived 30 minutes late and stone cold. The bed was super comfy, rooms and hotel were very clean and the complimentary lunch we had was delicious. Spa was much smaller than we imagined although it was nice and very clean. Whilst Aytash was quick to help us and resolve our issues, we left with a sour taste in our mouths, after what should’ve been our best ever hotel experience based on the cost. Location for us was great, 15 minute walk to Oxford street."
626,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,We had a fantastic stay here earlier this month. Our room was stunning and the location was perfect for the attractions we wanted to visit. All the staff were very welcoming - Amanda in the restaurant was particularly helpful and so lovely to chat to. We will definitely be back!
627,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Thanks for a wonderful overnight stay which was a special treat for us. The decor was amazing! Particular thanks to Chris on reception for your help and advice. We were looked after from start to finish!
628,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Stayed at your wonderful hotel whilst visiting friends in the Capital, this was our first stay but won’t be our last. Our room was out of this world, more than we expected but what made our stay so special were your wonderful team, every single person we came into contact with: welcoming, warm & exceptionally professional without being too much. Too many to name but the ones that stood out to our family, firstly was your Doorman Livio, absolute gent, Amanda in the Restaurant, how nice to hear a fellow northerner 😊 & Chris on reception who was great with our son! A wonderful stay & one I would recommend to my friends & family!"
629,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Superb hotel - luxury combined with top class personal service. Hard to beat in London and excellent value for money. The room was so quiet and comfortable with everything thought of. Make sure you go to “the view” on the 6th floor for the best views of Green park and Buckingham palace!!
630,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Had a very enjoyable stay in mid January this year. Room was spacious and comfortable, loved the fact there was a nice coffee machine not the usual powered rubbish. Staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast included was great, I didn't manage to sample the food for dinner this time though, will do in the future."
631,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Fantastic hotel, views from the top floor, service and location is perfect for everything London. We stayed in one of the suites with our 2 kids, the hotel made it super special for them and us! Also enjoyed the cocktails in the bar, made to perfection!"
632,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Great location, comfy rooms and helpful staff. Beds are very comfy and The View does indeed have a good view. The staff are polite but unobtrusive, very helpful, Chris on front desk and Keren in The View"
633,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"I decided to meet a colleague for a working lunch at the Athenaeum I had the classic burger and chips which I thought was good value. The team were attentive but not overbearing, allowing for a very productive meeting. I will definitely be having more of my meetings at the athenaeum. I would recommend this venue to all my business associates."
634,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Had the best stay ever , the team made me feel like I was at home . Will definitely be staying again on our next trip when we are back in London and will also refer all friends and family to stay at this wonderful hotel"
635,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,The entire hotel is exceptionally good. Rooms are comfortable and spotless. The staff from the door to reception is friendly and extremely helpful. The tasting menu with wine pairing at the hotel restarount was top class.
636,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,We come to London most years to see the Christmas lights and decided to stay overnight and treat ourselves to some pampering. The hotel was perfect. The staff so kind and attentive. The View from the 10th floor incredible. We will be back.
637,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Exceptional customer service in an ideal location to enjoy London. Evening meal set menu fantastic & excellent value for money. Will definitely return. Lovely atmosphere with contemporary interior but very comfortable.
638,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,We found the hotel to be one of the best we've stayed in London. Top class service and facilities. The bedrooms were fantastic and the location was excellent. Every member of staff was polite and courteous and could'nt do enough for you. Would definitely come back!
639,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Everything from check-in to check-out was amazing. The staff are very warm and friendly and go out of their way to make your feel special. Dinner in the restaurant was lovely. The ambience and service was just wonderful. For all your London stays, the Athenaeum Hotel is the one!"
640,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Lovely hotel in a great location. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had a lovely room overlooking the park.The breakfast was good with plenty of choice. My husband enjoyed using the spa.I would definitely stay here again when visiting London.
641,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"The hotel was a great find. We will stay here next time we are in London. The hotel is beautiful, very clean and the service was caring. A special mention to the lady from the North of England for looking after us in the restaurant. We will be back! It is worth the extra for a Park View room, stunning looking out at Green Park."
642,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"A lovely stay, from beginning to end. Food was superb, lots of friendly, professional staff. Room 714 very comfortable although noise from Aircon outside our window could be heard throughout the night."
643,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"Overall a great experience in a great location, quick check-in and -out, friendly staff, clean and recently refurbished rooms. Restaurant and drinks services also quick and efficient. Definitely recommendable"
644,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,Worst hotel i’ve stayed at in London and will not recommend to anybody I know. Housekeeping left our door open and unlocked and we realised when we came back late from dinner. No compensation. Unsafe.
645,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"We returned to the Athenaeum and stayed in one of the residences which are superb. The team are all so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble. They all take great delight in making your stay special."
646,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"I could not rate this place more highly! My welcome was so warm and I commented to my partner how wonderful the place looked and even smelt. We were greeted and after a swift check in were shown to our beautiful room. As a frequent traveller, I know what to look for in terms of cleanliness and standards and The Atheneum team went above and beyond. We had a stunning room with gorgeous amenities and a lovely little room gift. We sadly didn't get to experience the restaurant as we had theatre tickets, but we ordered room service which was above and beyond our expectations. In the morning we had booked the spa and were able to truly relax in style. We then had room service breakfast which was 10/10, I didn't need to eat until much later that evening. I couldn't recommend this place…"
647,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"We had an absolutely fantastic stay at the Atheneum in London! The rooms were great, modern, lovely looking and all the amenities needed. What really stood out though was the absolutely fantastic and kind service we received. For reference, we stayed there for our wedding weekend (Friday - Sunday). Pretty much every member of their staff was super friendly, accommodating and helpful. We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. Note though: The spa and gym are small. But there its in central London, so there is plenty of other stuff to do."
648,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,"We stayed here last weekend and had an amazing time. All of the hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating, a special mention to the lady (sorry I didn’t get her name) who served us at breakfast she was so lovely. The hotel room is beautiful and has all the amenities you need. The hotel is situated in a fantastic spot just a short walk to Buckingham palace through the park! We had such an amazing stay here we will definitely be coming back."
649,The Athenaeum Hotel & Residences,This was my second visit to the hotel and understood the high amount I am paying but thought it would be great stay like first time. But many issues was wrong. I asked to change my pillows to non allergic twice and only got it when I asked for the third time after 4 days of my stay. I have to ask for the replenishment of the tea baba. The toiletries. Vanity kit!!. Every trial to call the reception from the room was unsuccessful. It stay ringing for ever and no one answer although by going down I found 4 staff standing there!! The house keeping lady came in the room when the sign of Don’t disturb was on and my daughter was in the shower. One of the ground office staff was telling my that my room is only for one person where I booked the highest suit with 2 beds indications on…
650,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","My husband and I have stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions over nearly 3 decades. It has never failed to impress. This time, as a special treat, we experienced one of the new loft rooms with a spa bathroom - sauna and steam room included. Love the Clarins toiletries."
651,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Had a fantastic time at the salutation as always staff are wonderful so welcoming and helpful. Food in the restaurant was excellent had an evening meal and breakfast plenty of choice. This is a wonderful place to stay would highly recommend
652,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Whilst the hotel is well located and serves a good breakfast, it is otherwise not recommended. It is massively overpriced given the size and comfort of the room. Even with the window open and fan on, we sweltered and barely slept. Staff did not seem to care about this on check out."
653,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","This hotel is luxurious. It is also central to Ambleside so is the perfect location. We had a room with a hot tub on the balcony which was amazing. The room was large and had all the facilities you need. The staff in the hotel are so friendly and helpful, especially Manuel in the dining room. We used the pool area which has a steam room, sauna and jacuzzi and it was always quiet. Anita at the Clarins spa was really knowledgeable and gave great advice for skincare and massage."
654,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Only our second stay at this brilliant hotel. Rooms, staff, food, service all excellent. Ejoyed both the breakfast and the evening meal. Staff friendly & can't do enough for you. We booked our next stay before we left. Would highly recommend, sure you'll love it."
655,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","This hotel is the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Total perfection. Every staff member so friendly and helpful. Immaculately clean and food was so delicious. We asked for a room change on our 2nd day to one with a balcony, Kerry on reception was so understanding and kind, she arranged this for us, and we got a room with a view and a hot tub, perfect way to celebrate our Silver Wedding Anniversary , and a bottle of bubbly too. Well done to you all, take a bow."
656,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We especially like the town centre location of the Salutation Hotel, as there is a good choice of bars & restaurants within walking distance, though we'd advise to book a table if possible since they can get busy. There are lots of walks in the mountains & fells which start & finish in Ambleside."
657,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","A beautiful break in the Lake District. Beautiful weather, excellent accommodation, wonderful service and a welcome return to our favourite hotel.Travelled by train, used senior bus passes for local travel with bus stop outside the hotel. Hotel offers a warm welcome and a very personal service. Their loyalty rewards offered a further discount on our bill."
658,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","This is a hotel that knows what it's doing. It is a 'classic' , comfortable type of hotel, with a particular focus on excellent breakfasts. The staff seem happy, the place is very clean, and the situation could not be better. I left some shoes behind and they forwarded them to me without even charging me."
659,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We have stayed all over the lakes for many years and without doubt this is the best hotel we have stayed in. Right in the centre of Ambleside with free parking and amazing facilities. The staff are amazing - calm, friendly and all professional. Food amazing - succulent local lamb or plump trout beautifully presented and very tasty. I loved my stay and will definitely be back."
660,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Excellent hotel and spa and we have stayed here several times, the staff and location are second to none. The bar is well stocked at reasonable prices and the breakfast service is absolutely brilliant. The pool and spa are superb as well as the rooms. Definitely will be back in later in the year."
661,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We spent three nights here during a very warm June long weekend, which coincided with half term so very busy in Ambleside with tourists. To be able to park securely in the centre of Ambleside is the first bonus, but the hotel itself is excellent. The staff were helpful during booking several times and once we arrived we couldn't fault their excellent attitude, demeanour and service. The pool, outside jacuzzi, etc, are really smart and enjoyable. The lounge areas (several) are plush and comfortable without being too posh. The bar drink prices are fine (we joined the westmorland club for £25, which gives us two £25 vouchers for dining and 10% off drinks so it was a no-brainer). The evening we ate in was lovely for both service and food (we had sea bass and salmon, both generous…"
662,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Exceeded expectations for attention to detail, courteous staff, comfortable quiet rooms, and spa facility. The restaurant menu was good, although noticeably better on our first night. Not the same chef on the second evening I suspect. However, could not fault the standard of service. A truly enjoyable experience for one and all."
663,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Just ended our umpteenth visit to the Salutation in Ambleside. The friendliest place we have ever stayed where your every need is covered and the ambiance and decor is superb as well as the food. Breakfasts are still waiter/waitress service and throughout everyone is well trained efficient and friendly. Try it sometime but leave space for us please
664,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","A perfect location as a base for walking from. We had a balcony that overlooked the town that was lovely. Excellent food, especially breakfast. The spa was relaxing and peaceful. Comfy room, really friendly helpful staff. Would recommend for adults."
665,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","After reading the reviews left by previous visitors, it was obvious that the Salutation was where we were going to stay. The room was nice, clean and peaceful, had a balcony room overlooking a pleasant stream. The hotel bar was pleasant, tidy and comfortable. The missus enjoyed the spa treatments and all the little goodies they gave. As with everyone elses comments relating to parking, yes, it was a bit snug, but it's only if others park properly.(obviously not the hotels fault)"
666,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We stayed in one of the newly completed Loft Suites. The room was beautiful - very comfortable and spacious with a large jacuzzi bath, sauna and shower all tastefully designed in slate. The leisure facilities are excellent. The hearty breakfasts are cooked to order, with plenty to choose from. Dinner in the hotel restaurant was very nice. Altogether a perfectly relaxing stay in the beautiful village of Ambleside."
667,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","This is one of the best run hotels I have ever been to. Service, cleanliness, staff attitude and breakfast is all exceptional. any niggles were dealt with promptly and with a smile. Thoughtful touches in rooms like fans and additional heaters as well as a functional fridge. More salad or vegetarian options on the evening menu would have tempted me to eat at the hotel in the evening as well."
668,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Excellent stay for us and our two little ones. Location exceptional and quality of service up to the usual high standards. The hotel parking removed the stress of parking in a very busy town over a bank holiday.
669,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","My partner and I booked this hotel as it was 5 stars and meant to be the best in Ambleside and it was a pleasant and nice stay but by far it was not worth the money. The spa was great and felt super social and the rooms were nice and big and comfortable and the lounges and bar was nice but no where near worth £200 a night Im afraid. You would be better off staying in a cheaper guesthouse but we heard that they are terrible largely speaking. It may very well be the best hotel in Ambleside, mind you the staff were amazing, it was a great time and the location could not have been better. Great trip nonetheless was just surprised at the cost for what it was."
670,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We have stayed at the Salutation a number of times and would thoroughly recommended it. Every stay has been excellent. Spacious rooms, lovely spa and great breakfast. Location is unbeatable. Staff are always friendly."
671,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",I have stayed at The Salutation Hotel Ambleside many times over the past ten years and always had a great experience both with the quality of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. The hotel has been upgraded and extended over the years . Everything is perfect with quality decor. A most relaxing holiday. I have used the Spa on one occasion and that is a relaxing treat.
672,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Whenever we stay in Ambleside we stay at the Salutation Hotel, 10 out of 10 always. Great Hotel and all the Staff are very very good at their jobs in the Hotel, be it Reception to Housemaids. We love this Hotel."
673,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Great quality / value in a perfect location in the heart of Ambleside. Ample parking but a little awkward in places. Only breakfast and dinner available no lunch but plenty of places in town. Staff are warm and friendly
674,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","The Ambleside was a Lovely hotel very convenient and a lovely spa , the hotel staff were helpful the breakfast was a lovely start to the day too. There was plenty of parking which was great as we had a mini bus . We would definitely return."
675,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","A fabulous stay with friends over the Coronation weekend. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful & polite & the hotel rooms & facilities were first class & the breakfasts were amazing. This is our second visit & we will definitely be back."
676,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We’ll run, friendly hotel in the heart of Ambleside. Throw in a pool and spa! What’s not to like! Parking can be a bit tight, but it’s secure once your in. Overall the breakfast is good and plentiful, always some improvement to be made but you can say that about anywhere."
677,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We picked the hotel as my partner has stayed here before and it didn't disappoint. It is a very central location which made exploring around Ambleside very easy. The team were great; very friendly and helpful. The only thing to be aware of is that our room didn't have air conditioning and it was warm in the evening which meant that the window was open, and as you are opposite the Ambleside Inn, there was noise late into the evening on two of our three evenings."
678,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Excellent hotel with the balance just right of great service with comfortable surroundings. The staff are friendly, the hotel Is spotless, breakfast is first class. It has everything we need. There are lots of lovely touches which just make a stay here special. The location is right in the centre of town however there is no noise disturbance from traffic. We can reserve taking and so there's no worry. Two minutes from the hotel, there has a lovely waterfall walk to the back if the hotel."
679,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Very nice stay. Staff are lovely and very helpful. Pool area very nice, tho the jets on the outside pool were not working when we visited. Hot tub on balcony was great, lovely and hot, tho definitely needs a screen between the properties for privacy. The lounge area are fabulous, very clean and comfortable. The location couldn’t be better, central Ambleside, and lots of parking on site."
680,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","From check in to check out, the standards of service were excellent. This is a beautiful hotel and cannot be recommended highly enough. The staff are so friendly and helpful and the position of the hotel is perfect."
681,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",We have just returned from a weekend away for my Birthday. We had an amazing weekend this hotel is excellent everything was spot on. We had the Langdale room with a hot tub it was a lovely room spotless and very comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with lots of choices and the staff lovely and very accommodating. We are already talking about coming back later in the year. Thank you to you all for a perfect Birthday weekend.
682,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","We splashed out for our 20th anniversary and booked a fabulous spa room with a sauna,and private hot tub on our balcony, we loved it. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The bed is very firm. Breakfast was made even more wonderful by the fabulous Spanish gentleman who greeted us and made us feel very welcome and like nothing was too much trouble, thank you ! Great food selection and quality. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
683,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","This was our second visit to this lovely hotel, which is well positioned in the village of Ambleside. On our first visit we had a wonderful Spa room.. beautiful furnishings comfortable bed and facilities to die for..Hot tub, Sauna and Steam shower we were bowled over by how clean and modern this room was...well worth the extra to secure one. On our second visit we booked late and plumped for a club room again with hot tub facilites..well...just as fabulous...we were placed in Troutbeck..so lovely and private, practically had our own front door entrance from just a stones throw from the hotel. Beautifully furnished, a huge bathroom and shower, hot tub in a lovely garden area could not fault it. Unfortunately due to the hotel experiencing a kitchen fire we could not get the…"
684,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Excellent hotel with excellent facilities. Welcoming and helpful team members. We enjoyed the room with our own jacuzzi bath, sauna and steam - a real treat for our special wedding anniversary! Great location for visiting Ambleside town and the surrounding area. Fabulous walking. Weather was kind so all in all a fantastic stay."
685,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",An excellent hotel in a prime central location with its own free car park. Comfortable lounges tastefully furnished and a beautiful indoor swimming pool. Would highly recommend. My only problem was the bed was too firm for my taste although my wife found it acceptable.
686,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Wow! Thought I would try a hotel in a busier area and glad to have found this gem. Great location in heart of Ambleside with plenty of on site parking. However, what stands out from this hotel, is the staff. I have never met a hotel population so intent on ensuring you have a good stay. Welcoming, helpful, engaging, polite. Customer service at the heart of what they do. I was notified before staying that a fire had damaged the kitchen which would affect meals at the hotel and only a continental breakfast would be available. This was managed so well. More than enough for everyone and the Buck’s Fizz was a nice touch. As was the birthday card in my room. The pool was lovely and my spa treatment…worth the trip for that alone. I loved my stay here and will be back. Rare to find such…"
687,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Had an excellent weekend away for my birthday. The salutation go above and beyond. Excellent service and nothing is too much trouble. Stayed in the loft suite and the room was something else. Can't speak highly enough of the staff
688,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Good experience overall. Great location. Loved the spa. Very friendly and helpful staff. Shame there was no hot breakfast due to a kitchen fire and felt that a greater reduction should have been made ( I had prepaid). We stayed in a classic room and it was little small for our needs. We will return though as everything else was fine.
689,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Great location, excellent service, stunning room and lovely breakfast Thoroughly recommend the suites with hot tub, over-looking the stream Great service in every aspect, as always Spotlessly clean as always"
690,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Stayed for a couple of nights over the Easter break. Honestly the hotel is great. We stayed in one of the loft rooms and had our own steam, sauna and jacuzzi in the suite. It was all high end materials and really comfortable room. The staff were amazing, no exceptions and couldn't do enough for you. The spa is really nice and free to use the pool and hydrotherapy options which were all lovely. I especially enjoyed the outdoor hot tub with the massage options! Unfortunately the kitchen was closed during out stay so they couldn't serve hot food - the hotel did call me in advance to advise this, but I was a little hesitant we would receive a basic continental breakfast - it wasnt! They really made sure there were plenty of options and the service was great. We will…"
691,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Hard to know where to start beyond ‘this is an exceptional place to stay’. Communication: every staff member (and I mean every) was helpful, communicative, friendly, informative (whether it was about walks, ideas for a rainy day, or what tea to choose for breakfast!). Pre stay, they’d had a fire in the kitchen and the way that they communicated this and the accommodations made because of this were superb (and the continental breakfast served incredible and varied). Every staff member behaved as though they really did care for your welfare, so it felt like being in a really comfy place but spoiled and looked after. Rooms and beds were perfect. Good space, great service, lovely bathroom, comfy mattress and pillows, thoughtful layout and decor. Spa: I’ve rated separately, but…"
692,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","I was blown away by this hotel from the moment me and my husband stepped through the door. We stayed for 2 nights in the STICKLEGHYLL suite which has a sauna and hot tub in the room and it was amazing! This was our first proper night away without our kids in years and we loved every single minute. All staff at the hotel were so friendly and couldn’t do enough for all the guest staying at the hotel. Our room was spotless, the breakfast was delicious, the spa facilities were relaxing and it’s in a great location. We will definitely be back again. Thank you for a lovely relaxing stay."
693,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",All staff give their all to make your stay the best they can. Meals are all very good although since covid the variety has been reduced. The quality of service has not diminished and it appears there is a sharing of duties between staff within the hotel and restaurant. Very comfortable atmosphere.
694,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Our third time here and you simply can’t fault the place. We stayed in Rothay suite again which has a hot tub on the balcony overlooking the centre of Ambleside Hotel is spotlessly clean, staff very friendly and the breakfast is exceptional Spa and pool area are both spot on We’ll be back"
695,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Our fifth time back to the Salutation and the hotel and staff were as excellent as ever. From the reception, to the restaurant to cleaning teams everyone you meet is polite, friendly and professional.. The hotel is clean, warm, welcoming and relaxing."
696,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","This is my third stay at this hotel. It sits right in the heart of Ambleside surrounded by great shops, a lively atmosphere and wonderful scenery, a mecca for hill walkers! The hotel is extremely well run. Beautifully clean, well decorated and with a few quirky touches to make you smile. There is a choice of room sizes and prices. Even the cheapest rooms have a nice ensuite, a seating area, and nice large bed. There is also a spa bath. The hotel provides a lovely breakfast selection with very attentive staff, food is perfectly cooked. They also serve a wonderful evening meal, also beautifully cooked with a good selection of drink options. There is a nice lounge with intimate seat groupings spread through three rooms. The bar is open all day for alcoholic or non alcoholic cold…"
697,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Had a lovely time at this hotel. Celebrated hubby,a special birthday with friends.staff were excellent and very welcoming.I booked 2rooms one was very modern and the other could do with a facelift but all in all it was a lovely break."
698,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection",Fantastic hotel. We paid for a room with a hot tub. It was well worth the extra money. We were in Troutbeck room which was situation away from main Bullding but still accessible to the main building. We had a private terrace which was lovely. The bedroom and bathroom were spacious - only criticism was the shower curtain on the shower cubicle was too short so the bathroom floor got too wet and could be a slip hazard. Breakfast was one of the best I have ever had even though it was table service nothing was missing. In fact there was probably too much on offer. We also dined on the Saturday evening in the hotel restaurant and again we couldn’t fault the food. Great portion sizes and affordable.
699,"Ambleside Salutation Hotel, BW Premier Collection","Excellent location and staff (parking is a major challenge) highly priced for an ok room. Great breakfast. Hotel well decorated but the Suite we had, had only one comfortable armchair, which was disappointing"
700,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",What an amazing service we received from Stevie & Linda when we arrived for our afternoon tea. The food was well presented and plentiful and came with drinks as well as tea or coffee. Would highly recommend a visit.
701,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Had a great experience at raddison red. Everything clean and fresh. Stevie and Linda were great at breakfast, welcoming and helpful. The food at Breakfast and dinner was great. All staff welcoming and friendly"
702,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Fantastic service from when we arrived. Loved the room, really spacious and beds very comfy. Sky bar delightful with great views as well as great cocktails. Really lovely breakfast, Stevie and Linda very welcoming and enjoyed Stevie's banter. Defo be back."
703,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Great hotel. There was a slight problem at checkin but Bradley sorted this all out to our satisfaction. Really helpful guy. Perfect location for Hydro. Really friendly efficient staff. Nicest and friendliest staff we have had in a hotel for a long while. Really good breakfast.Well done to the whole team. We will stay here again in the future.
704,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Staff were excellent and attentive. Breakfast was very good as was Pizza dinner. Rooms very comfortable, clean and well maintained with great shower. Couldn't fault anything and live music a great bonus!!!"
705,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",We love the hotel and will return but the felt on this occasion the beds comfort were compromised with very poor quality pillows. Also lack of bottled water offers in the room when the room is costs a little more than my weeks wage . All staff are friendly and very helpful.
706,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Loved the Radisson Red. We stayed 2 nights to see Elton John and upgraded (£25 per night) to a Junior suite with a view of the Ovo Hydro, The Armadillo and Finnieston Crane. The hotel is very music focussed in it's decor and it's a cool place to sit around. The room, on the 7th floor was fantastic, spotlessly clean and came with a long table by the window, a fridge, loads of storage space and really nice toiletries. The room was huge and the shower etc were all perfect. No queues (surprising with Elton John a stones throw from the front door) for what was a really good breakfast and the staff in the Sky bar were really accommodating when we asked to move table and change numbers of guests etc. I'd highly recommend it."
707,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Gifted a wee overnighter in this local hotel as a present so not somewhere we would normally stay Check in easily enough Parked round the back (£10) and it’s a short taxi ride into town Returning to the Sky bar it was busy but got seated no problem Not booked in for the breakfast , just decided to stroll in,no problem as Stevie effortlessly slotted us into a nice booth at the window Food was plentiful, omelettes huge and plenty of options Staff at breakfast attentive and helpful We’d be happy to return here, found the process flawless, no hidden charges and all the staff approachable, engaging and professional"
708,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",We had a lovely evening at Skybar. Poppy was fab and managed to extend our table for us. Food and rose wine were absolutely amazing. Even loved watching the rain out the window! We’ll def be back. Thanks Poppy!
709,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",The Radisson Red has a great rooftop bar which is perfect for taking in the Glasgow skyline with a drink on a sunny day . However on a recent visit it was just too hot outside and my friends and I decided to move inside where there were many empty sofas and tables. Having given up our outdoor seat to another couple we were told that all the tables and sofas were reserved. We said that there were no signs on most of them to say so and they said they didn’t have enough signs but that they are all booked within the next 15 minutes. So we went back outside to swelter in worse seats and waited and watched while half of them lay empty for another hour and a half. It was a disappointing end to our visit because up until then the service had been great.
710,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","just now on Google We had theeeee most fabulous afternoon at Red Raddison Sky Bar! The staff first and foremost! Stevie and Teigan were exceptional!! Thank you so much for your hospitality today! The afternoon tea was delicious and veered away from the usual doughy sandwich and scone theme! With quirky bacon and maple mini roll, duck bao bun, sausage roll and chicken waffle mmmm 😋 in addition to yummy strawberry milkshake, mini scone red velvet cake and jelly pot! The terrace and views are the icing on the cake! We can’t wait to return mainly for Stevie’s Glasgow banter!! Priceless! Loved our experience! Trip"
711,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Highly recommend on entering reception A very warm friendly receptionist Jack and Chloe made our arrival so easy to check inn everything was explained about our stay. We were guided to the Red Sky Bar for afternoon tea, again a very friendly staff member Stevie showed us to our table and was exceptionally helpful and friendly, Our room was to a very high standard with an amazing view , breakfast was served by Stevie and Linda , Staff at Radisson have to be congratulated for their friendliness and all very professional and helpful. Look forward to our next visit."
712,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Superb business stay, a really great vibe at Radisson Red Glasgow. Fabulous room so spacious and comfortable with desk and working area essential for a business stay. Most of all, super efficient and friendly service in the restaurant with Stevie and Linda in particular being the stars of breakfast. Can't wait for the next visit"
713,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",What a fab place to stay! Lovely room and great breakfast! I’m Gluten Free and Stevie and Linda are brilliant! Asked about Gluten free food for breakfast and was given Gf hot breakfast and Gf muffin.
714,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",only thing i would recommend is if you are a person that feels the heat to take a travel fan wiht you has the room only got cooler after a long while. i was swealtering.loved the shower and lovely view
715,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Fun hotel with excellent restaurant and rooftop. Great location for conferences and the city center. River walk right at the doorstep and tons of restaurants that are walking distance . Staff is really top notch!
716,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",We held a networking event at the Radisson Red. I cannot fault the event team. From Amy who was impeccable with her prompt emails and organisational skills to Euan and Emma who served the perfect Customer Service and nothing was too much hassle. This is a venue I would recommend and use again myself for forthcoming events.
717,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","My first time in Scotland - here for the European genetics conference right next door at SEC. Just wanted to give a huge shout out to Stevie and Linda at the OUI restaurant who were so welcoming and got me to like haggis. Stevie taught me about the magic of HP sauce with haggis and convinced me to try it again to see if he could change my mind about haggis before I flew home. Linda was encouraging and patient and came in to check up on me. They shared their culture and food with me, and if that isn’t the epitome of hospitality, then I don’t know what is!"
718,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Excellent stay at the Radisson Red! Perfect rooms, service and location. Really couldn’t ask for anything better! The staff are especially kind and courteous, the breakfast service was a great addition to our stay, Stevie and Linda especially were charismatic and full of energy during the breakfast service and left a smile on our faces for the rest of the day! We were staying here to attend a concert at the OVO hydro and the hotel served as a perfect stay for that purpose! Will definitely be back next time I’m in Glasgow. Highly recommended!"
719,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Rooms were lovely and bright and the beds were super comfortable. The breakfast was lovely and the breakfast staff were amazing. Stevie and Linda provided excellent service and Stevie was super funny and his singing brightened my morning. Thanks!

721,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Came with my mum using an itison afternoon tea voucher. A step away from the old traditional afternoon tea of boring sandwiches and made it boujee with bao buns, chicken and waffles. Cakes/milkshakes and cocktails were amazing and so were the staff. We were served by Linda and orla who came over and chatted away. Finished it off with tea and coffee. Perfect wee afternoon. Been to radison red before for drinks and it’s always such a good vibe. Loved it!!"
722,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Had a wonderful time at the Sky Bar, with our attentive and accommodating host Poppy looking after us throughout our visit, and fantastic bar service from Mark…we’ll definitely be back for more…🥂🥂🥂"
723,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Great hotel with fabulous rooms and amenities. We loved the Sky Bar and the food was good too. The hotel was spotless! We were situated on the second floor and had great views looking onto the river. The drinks are reasonably priced for a city hotel.
724,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Great stay, everyone very friendly apart from the red sky bar. Expensive drinks with no care to the detail. Bar was always soaking wet, lots of staff standing around, tables dirty etc you need to get the breakfast team to train those upstairs, much better care for detail, organised, friendly and showed great energy."
725,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Stevie and Daniel were so helpful and enthusiastic with our course running in Studio 1! Great service and helped ensure our day went as smooth as possible. They made it easy for all our participants to find us and the day went brilliantly
726,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","I stayed for a business trip and was met on my 1:30am arrival after a long flight by the cheery face of Andy. Lovely to have after such a long late trip. The room was clean and comfortable. Again met by Andy on the checkout the next morning who was again chatty and helpful even after a night shift. I appreciated the friendly face. Thanks very much, and i would definitely re visit!"
727,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Amazing hotel with tremendous staff and awesome views. Loved the Skybar and easy stroll into the centre along the river. Our check in & check out were made extra special by the lovely Julie who was able to train new staff and make a fuss of us at the same time. Looking over the Finneston Cran and the river Clyde was really spectacular too!
728,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Stayed at the Radisson Red for a birthday night away. Upon arrival, we were advised that our room has been upgraded to the superior room which was a lovely surprise. The hotel is very nice and clean and the staff are very welcoming and willing to help. We would highly recommend the Sky Bar for cocktails and an amazing view."
729,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","On arrival at Radisson Red, Glasgow, we were warmly welcomed by Bradley, setting a lovely tone to our stay. Our room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was tasty and our servers (Linda and Stevie) made the experience fun and relaxed. Friendly and professional staff really made our stay memorable and will be the lure that warrants a return visit."
730,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Lovely lunch in the stunning Red sky bar. Food from the small plates menu was delicious, drinks lovely and view was stunning. Our server Linda was chatty and helpful and made our lunch experience very enjoyable. Will definitely be back!"
731,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Fab afternoon in the Red sky bar looked after beautifully by our server Linda. Nothing was any bother to her and she was welcoming and friendly. The food from the small plates menu was delicious and the cocktails were lovely. What a great place for lunch with stunning views up the Clyde. Will definitely be back!
732,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Had a great stay at the Radissin Red and all the staff were so helpful. Linda in particular went out of her way to engage and her bright demeanour brought a smile to our party's face. Would def stay there again Located near OVO Hydro and bars/restaurants in Finneston. Train station 10 minute walk
733,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Travelled up from Manchester for work for a couple of nights. Made to feel welcome immediately. Great rooms with incredible views, and great working set up. Breakfast was brilliant and really attentive staff, thanks to the whole team especially Stevie and Linda!"

Linda , done an amazing job of serving our afternoon tea which was appreciated greatly! Amazing experience!!"
737,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Speedy check in. Spacious, comfortable & spotlessly clean bedrooms. Great atmosphere and very welcoming. Nice options for breakfast, something for everyone and the team there, especially Linda & Stevie cant do enough for you. See you again soon 😊"
738,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","All staff are really welcoming, you have everything you need in your room, mine was very spacious, great decor, a cozy king bed and a six seater table to get some extra work done (complete surprise). The breakfast hosts were fab (Stevie & Linda) and the recommendation of an extra poached egg was spot on! I’ve tried a few hotels in Glasgow for work meetings, this is surely to become my regular choice."
739,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Very pleasant hotel very friendly helpful staff, Linda and Stevie at breakfast couldn't have been more helpful. Fair brightens up the morning! Roof bar a nice addition to take in some of the Glasgow sky line to the west."
740,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Staff so friendly and welcoming. The people really do make Glasgow a great city to stay! In particular Stevie and Linda were fantastic. So warm and made me feel right at ease with my stay. Thank you guys!
741,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Service with a smile, thank you Bailey and Erin for making our evening so magical in the sunny sky bar - would recommended for the perfect summer atmosphere, remember your sun cream. Pornstar martinis we’re exceptional - thank you girls next time we’re in Scotland we’ll visit!"
742,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","This is an amazing hotel. Cool vibes, great decor, modern and home to my favourite Sky Bar playing the best DJ’s. But just wanted to give a shout out to Dana for going that mile extra and noticing my regularity to the hotel and making me feel extra welcome. Personal service second to none. 10/10 Angela Peden"
743,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Stayed here the start of June with my husband for our aniversary. Very modern hotel with unique decor with a great vibe! Reception staff was amazing at upgrading with welcome drinks and note in room, Thanks linda! Lovely views especially from the Sky bar, the girl on hosting was amazing but didn't catch the name. We ate at the Oui bar two nights and honestly some of the best bar and restaurant service I've had from a hotel in terms of genuine friendly and happy staff. Shout out to the lovely girls on the bar Sophie and Sam who made some great cocktails. Will 100% return to this hotel and recommend to anyone as a treat when looking for somewhere to stay or have a drink! The hotel is also dog friendly which i didn't know prior but will definitely bring my pup along next time :)"
744,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","We went to celebrate my friends retirement with Afternoon Tea booked at the Sky bar. A big thank you to Julie at reception and Linda at the Sky Bar. You were both fantastic. Your warm welcome, humour ,friendliness and customer interaction was superb. The food, surroundings and atmosphere were great.Linda herself was exceptional. Both girls a credit to your company. First visit to Radisson Red in Glasgow and certainly won't be our last..xx"
745,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Hotel excellently placed for a visit to Glasgow; walking distance to Hydro - hop on bus stoped across the road ; made travelling around easy . Food good - in the main - breakfast a little chaotic even when not busy - about 15-20 min wait best we had 45 mins first morning was frustrating. Sky bar was a bit over- rated staff quite dictatorial made you feel uncomfortable to be there - so didn’t return - shame cause views were great.
746,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow",Rooms were so spacious and very clean. Couldn’t hear a thing during the night which was amazing. Unsure what his name was but the younger guy on reception was so nice when he checked us in to our room! Only downside was the pillows were too fluffy so weren’t other comfiest :(. But overall it was an amazing stay and great value for money. Would definitely return! xx
747,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Fantastic hotel, sky bar was amazing especially since the sun was out. Only criticism and its my personal preference was the pillows were too fluffy, which makes 1 pillow not enough and 2 too much. Restaurant staff were outstanding, especially Ian in the restaurant at night and Linda at breakfast - both couldn't do enough to help you and were extremely friendly."
748,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","Linda took care of me . It was a busy time in the restaurant for breakfast. She was friendly and helpful as it’s my first time in Glasgow and in Scotland . She a 5 start server , friendly and great service. I would recommend to anyone to eat at the cafe 😊"
749,"Radisson RED Hotel, Glasgow","We have visited this hotel a few times. The previous stay was not great due to a rowdy event happening in the sky bar. However Julie and her team really made up for it in our most recent stay. With an upgraded room with lovely views of the Clyde and a welcome note and drinks. Amazing service from all staff, making you feel comfortable and nothing was a bother. The staff really went above and beyond. Definitely recommend staying here. Looking forward to my next stay at Red."
750,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Absolutely could not fault this place. Staff members were all so friendly and helpful. Location was fabulous, just across the road from the deer park. Hotel beautifully decorated and we had everything we needed. Breakfast was absolutely wonderful"
751,Richmond Hill Hotel,We stayed for 2 nights and everything was as expected. We had a Junior Suite for our family of three and there was loads of space. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great with loads of options for everyone’s preferences.
752,Richmond Hill Hotel,Gorgeous stay in a lovely junior suite with roll top bath! Dinner was super and made even more special by Patricia and staff who spoilt me on my birthday! Lovely touches - glass champagne and birthday desert given gratis by the team.
753,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Excellent room, amenities, service, breakfast, etc. It was perfect for my business trip survey. Location is quiet, in walking distance to restaurants and commercial areas. I will choose the hotel again on my next business trip."
754,Richmond Hill Hotel,"I have stayed twice now - as it is a convenient place to stay when visiting friends in the area. It is a lovely looking hotel. Very clean and welcoming. Some slight reservations: 1. Get there early as they do not have enough car parking spaces - and the ones they have are tight! 2. The hotel was ridiculously warm 3. At breakfast I do not expect to be charged for a latte. They offer filter coffee or tea only. Anyhting else needs to be bought - despite a hefty breakfast price regardless... 4. The two times i have stayed at the hotel, I have had a view of construction work taking place in the car park - or the bins. A bit disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice place. However, I'm not from London - I appreciate Richmond is a lovely area but it is also an expensive area…"
755,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Beautiful room, incredibly comfortable, exceptional staff can't do enough for you, view is beautiful and the roll top bath is such a wonderful treat, even in the hot weather! Thank you to the whole team at the Richmond Hill Hotel for providing a welcoming environment and base for my husband and I to have our vow renewal."
756,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Fantastic hotel in a lovely location. Within minutes from centre of Richmond, the Thames riverside and Richmond Park. Lovely room and restaurant and staff incredibly friendly and helpful. Fully recommend paying a visit, you won’t be disappointed."
757,Richmond Hill Hotel,"We were there for 4 days. The staff were very friendly and helpful taking good care of us. The food was also very well done tasty and a bit different to the usual. They had a power cut when we were staying so we couldn't dine in, but they compensated well"
758,Richmond Hill Hotel,"We have just arrived home from a lovely two night stay at The Richmond Hill Hotel. Everything about the hotel was great. Our bedroom with large roll top bath was very comfortable especially the bed. Spotlessly clean. We had afternoon tea on arrival which was delicious. Dinner on the second night was superb. All the staff were really friendly, helpful and polite and nothing was too much trouble. Choice at breakfast was amazing. Great location and very peaceful. 25 minutes walk to the tube to go into London which we did on the evening of arrival for a concert at The Royal Albert Hall and the following day for sightseeing. Perfect break. Thank you"
759,Richmond Hill Hotel,Perfect location lovely food and friendly staff comfortable room value fir money have been before would go again our daughter lives in Richmond . Would have stayed at hers but she’s packing up to move . Luckily still in Richmond .
760,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, you feel a sense of calm as soon as you walk through the door. The hotel is beautifully furnished, with large comfortable lounge areas in which to relax. The staff are friendly and very helpful, nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are not large, but very clean & beds are super comforable. The location is brilliant, walking to Richmind and overlooking the river. Breakfast is outstanding and excellent value"
761,Richmond Hill Hotel,Great 3 night stay with my partner as part of a wedding group - staff were very polite and helpful especially the bar waiters - breakfast was well stocked and fresh ! Room cleaners were polite and left the room spotless thanks for making this a pleasant experience! Also perfect location for walks in Richmond park and short walk to the shopping centre !
762,Richmond Hill Hotel,Every aspect of our stay was top quality and we will definitely stay again. The room was exceptional and all of the staff were very helpful and friendly. Having access to the car park prior to the checking in time was also an unexpected benefit.Would highly recommend.
763,Richmond Hill Hotel,Good location - main high road with restaurants about 15min walk away and station 20min walk. Room was gorgeous and bed was large and very comfortable. Staff were friendly and we arrived early and were able to check in straight away. One downside was we had a pram but had to go up some stairs to access the room which was tricky. I would recommend but if specific requirements I recommend ringing the hotel to ensure these are taken into account when allocating a room in future if required rather then rely on the notes on the booking.
764,Richmond Hill Hotel,We enjoyed our stay but the room was very small. I was impressed with the engineering of the. Bathroom set up but you don’t want to be moving walls around when you want to use the bathroom. Also there were urine stains around the toilet on the marble floor that wasn’t particularly pleasant.
765,Richmond Hill Hotel,We booked 3 superior double rooms. 2 for 2 nights and the other room for 1 night. The rooms were small. We were attending a wedding and there was not enough room in the wardrobe to hang up our clothes. We had to ask for an ironing board and an electric radiator to be removed from the room. The door to the room could not be fully opened with the radiator and the bag stand in use in the room. We paid around £1200 for the three rooms but still had to pay for parking £15 per car per day. Plus we also had to pay for breakfast £44 for 2rooms per day. I don’t consider what we received to be particularly good value and would not recommend or book again.
766,Richmond Hill Hotel,"I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff were professional, polite and knowledgeable. We had lunch on both days which was excellent and top quality. The hotel was clean throughout and in good condition."
767,Richmond Hill Hotel,"A lovely hotel right next to Richmond park and within easy walking distance of Richmond riverside and high street. Welcoming staff and lovely modern, well equipped room, on site free parking for direct bookings."
768,Richmond Hill Hotel,We only stayed one night as my partner was running from london to barcelona for charity and he has Parkinsons. The staff were friendly and happy and the room was perfect. The also welcomed our dog Oscar and we ate in the bar area and the food was really good too.
769,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Wonderful stay for a wedding event. Staff very friendly and helpful. Service was excellent and a good breakfast. Ask if you want anything not on show, like poached eggs for example as there's no 'egg station' as they have in some hotels. Bed a bit too soft for us but that's a personal choice. A warning - there is no lift on the old side of the hotel and quite a few stairs to climb so notify the hotel if you'd have a problem with this."
770,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Stayed 3 nights to visit Kew Gardens, Strawberry Hill and Ham House. Suited our needs and is a very pleasant location for a city hotel with parks and river walks close by. Our mid range bedroom was clean, a comfy bed, adequately equipped if a tad small. We only dined in one night (there are plenty of local restaurants to choose from) but dinner was good. Very good selection for breakfast. Must say that every member of staff we had contact with were extremely efficient, helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Car parking good. We will certainly stay here again."
771,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Hotel was pleasant, breakfast was great lots to choose from. However the hotel room was tiny (I had a double room) not enough room for two people. One thing I do have an issue with was the additional service charge that appeared on my bill. I called the hotel to ask what the charge was for, (the receptionist found it very difficult to explain) because I had a drink at the bar and someone bought it over to me I was charged an additional cost for that. I really don’t agree with these charges so for that reason I won’t be staying again - I think I paid enough for my room without hidden charges being applied to my bill."
772,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Stayed one night and it had easy access to the shopping areas but also the lovely scenery as you walked down the hill, with views of the river Thames. The walk up-hill is made slightly easier with the views, but still harder than going down. The staff helped whenever I had any questions, and the layout of the room is good, with the rainfall shower being part of my favourite thing from the hotel."
773,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Had a lovely stay, was able to check in early, which was very welcome, rooms are a little small but had everything we needed. Breakfast had lots of choice, hot and cold options. Situated in a lovely spot not far from the river, had a lovely walk along the river, was a great people watching spot."
774,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Thank you for an excellent stay, we revisited the area 25 years after our first date. The guest relations manager and all the staff were so friendly and accommodating including of our dog Archie who was with us. Great location on beautiful Richmond Hill with the best view in London. Rooms, bar and lounge areas all beautifully furnished - excellent food - highly recommended"
775,Richmond Hill Hotel,"From the moment we arrived to when we left every team member we interacted with was excellent! This is what makes a stay for us. The restaurant staff were especially exceptional, accommodating our request to sit outside when it wasn’t really even open! Looking after our puppy dog and just generally doing everything with a smile. The room was great, very comfortable and well equipped. I’m not a big fan of the glass toilet and shower setup but it was manageable. Breakfast was excellent, such a great variety on the continental section, really cleverly thought through options rather than just typical yoghurt, fruit and cheese. It made such a difference when you’re eating healthy and not wanting beige pastries and fried bacon (don’t get me wrong that did look good too!) I would…"
776,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Great rooms, clean and beautiful decor. Great check in and check out and kept our lugares for us: Room service was great and food was lovely. Staff super friendly and diligent. I would definitely recommend. Thank you for the lovely stay."
777,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Had another great stay at the Richmond Hil Hotel. Staff always friendly and welcoming. Room was clean and comfortable. Visited the Bar for a night cap, shown to our table and dealt with in a friendly and professional manner. Overall a great place to stay, would highly recommend."
778,Richmond Hill Hotel,Easy walk in to town. Steep coming back. Excellent breakfast. Comfortable rooms. Parking available free if you book direct with hotel. Worth the upgrade to front facing room. Music in public areas too loud
779,Richmond Hill Hotel,Lovely room with nice view of The Thames. Very friendly staff. Love the bar and The Terrace and the bar staff. Beautifully and conveniently positioned for access to Central London and obviously the glorious Richmond Park.
780,Richmond Hill Hotel,My third stay at this haven at the top of the hill and as always it was great from start to finish. The standards are extremely high and I always feel like a valued guest. I particularly like the public spaces in the hotel and the rooms are very comfortable.
781,Richmond Hill Hotel,"A combination of stylish and old-fashion London. The Richmond Hill does deliver a great experience. I was pleasantly surprised with how comfy the ned and pillows were, which coupled with the great shower temperature and water pressure makes it a hard to beat. Breakfast was full British style and of great taste. Overall a well recommended option for those that would like staying around Richmond."
782,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Richmond Hill Hotel was the venue of our wedding reception drinks followed by lunch in April 2023, as well as accomodating half of our guests for 2 nights. We are so happy we chose Richmond Hill Hotel. Our contact for our event was Roisin who was absolutely brilliant in ensuring we had considered all aspects of our wedding day and patiently adapted as our event evolved from what we initially discussed. We had 3 face to face meetings and left each time feeling that we could rely on the hotel staff and reassured that we were in good hands. Priyanka helped with the room bookings and communicated with great clarity and friendliness in the lead up to the weekend. On the day itself every member of staff was faultless and everything was managed so efficiently. We hired the Queens…"
783,Richmond Hill Hotel,"The hotel is in a great location. The rooms were modern and very clean. The bed was so comfortable, as were the pillows, we had the best nights sleep. Friendly staff and abeautiful breakfast with lots of selection. All in all a great visit and would highly recommend."
784,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Beautiful hotel up on Richmond Hill and easy walking distance into the centre. The staff were friendly and attentive and check-in didn’t take too long. We stayed in the lower-ground room which had windows up to the terrace that provided enough natural light. The beds were comfortable and there was tea and coffee provided. The bathroom was gorgeous - best thing about the room. Breakfast was lovely, a buffet style with an extensive range of delicious foods. Would love to stay again."
785,Richmond Hill Hotel,We stayed at The Richmond Hill to celebrate my birthday. We have stayed here on many occasions previously and see it as our special place in Richmond. We were pleased to discover that we had been given a room upgrade with a view overlooking the Thames. We love this hotel and look forward to staying there aqain hopefully in the not too distant future.
786,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Stunning room, fantastic breakfast and the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. We love coming to Richmond, and being close to the river is a great plus. Looking forward to our next visit already"
787,Richmond Hill Hotel,Short break with my partner and like Richmond as a base for various things in and around London This time rugby at Twickenham Then an evening in to central London via the train Then a day starting with breakfast and a mooch around Richmond itself
788,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Excellent hotel, the room was cosy and immaculate with a very comfortable bed and the staff were welcoming and well organised. We will be staying again as it is very well located and the bar has a great cocktail menu."
789,Richmond Hill Hotel,Would highly recommend if staying in the area.great vibe and comfy rooms and location. Friendly service and good value for money. Excellent facilities including Sky in the rooms. Would definitely return
790,Richmond Hill Hotel,"We stayed ,once again, at this hotel for a family Wedding which was to be held nearby. We experienced a wonderful few days . The staff were so very friendly and helpful in every way. The front desk staff could not have been nicer in greeting us on arrival and helping to unload luggage and take it to our room. Our room, a classic double, was immaculate . Cleanliness exemplary. Breakfast had a very good choice of dishes and was taken in an inviting restaurant. No fault with any meals . The food quality was excellent as was the service. My wife had arranged for friends to have a three course meal with drinks to celebrate our Sons last night as a single man. This was taken in a private dining room. The waiting on staff could not be faulted and so helped to make a very…"
791,Richmond Hill Hotel,"There is so much to love about this hotel that it’s disappointing to write a critical review. However to be candid I have been left disappointed. The staff were excellent and the breakfast very good. The room was well appointed and the Wi-Fi was strong. Didn’t use the gym, but looked reasonable for a hotel. Downsides were that the room was a little warm and the duvet and pillows uncomfortable. I did not sleep well. I was also surprised to have to pay extra for a cappuccino with my breakfast (around £5.00). Most hotels offer different coffees within their breakfast menu. I was equally surprised that from a healthy bar menu there was only one cider - again, even a Premier Inn offers a choice of these items. However what was most disappointing was that when I responded to…"
792,Richmond Hill Hotel,"The hotel was excellent, the staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great. The rooms were very clean and well equipped, we liked how the space changed with the movable wall and bathroom door! We really enjoyed our stay!"
793,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Lovely hotel with brilliant staff, nothing was too much trouble. We had rooms in the Georgian Wing, beautifully furnished, very comfortable beds and pillows, walk-in shower and plenty of towels plus Penhaligon's Toiletries. Excellent breakfast served in our room. Hotel is at the top of Richmond Hill with great views of the river and an easy walk down to Richmond Village. Will definitely stay again."
794,Richmond Hill Hotel,"I recently stayed here with my wife, father, sister and mother-in-law and will certainly be returning. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. Check in and check out was very easy. The rooms were extremely clean and well designed to maximise the space. The breakfast was excellent with a huge variety. The hotel is very close to the park and we enjoyed a long walk on the Saturday morning. The town centre is close by too with many different shops etc... Everything is within walking distance. I'd highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we will most certainly be returning. (I hope very soon!)"
795,Richmond Hill Hotel,"Really friendly check in staff, excellent quiet room if somewhat “compact” bathroom- but spotless. Very good location and outstanding breakfast. Look forward to visiting again. Ideal for checking out Richmond and the Thames walks."
796,Richmond Hill Hotel,"We stayed at the hotel with my 11 year old daughter. The room and other facilities were very good. The location us very picturesque and close to public transport. Although our room windows faced the main road, it was still quiet and cosy"
797,Richmond Hill Hotel,Our family of five stayed in two adjoining rooms. The hotel did a great job putting the rooms together and check in process was easy. Location on top of the hill is beautiful and a short and pleasant 15 minute walk down the hill to town. Highly recommend this hotel. Book direct to save.
798,Richmond Hill Hotel,Our second stay at the Richmond Hill Hotel was just as good as the first. It is so easy to commute into central London and yet you feel like you are in the country. The staff are the greatest strength of this hotel and made our stay even more special. Breakfast was excellent and once again the staff were extremely helpful. Our room was extremely comfortable and we will definitely be returning at some point in the future.
799,Richmond Hill Hotel,"We stayed at Richmond Hill Hotel for my partners 30th birthday, We stayed for 4 nights in the Georgian Deluxe room. I would highly recommend Richmond Hill Hotel, the room was very comfy and we both slept brilliantly. In our room we had a roll top bath at the end of the bed, it was great. The breakfast is great, a variety of hot and cold food. We also ate at the restaurant, again no complaints! I would reccmmend booking through the hotel/website as the prices were better and parking is also included. Great location."
800,Genting Hotel,"I stayed here whilst working at an exhibition at nearby NEC. Arrival was easy as I had VIP parking as part of my room rate, the car park was really convenient. The check in process was easy and the lady was very helpful. The room was a good size, and had a view of the lake. The bathroom was excellent with a great shower, and the bed was comfortable. I ordered room service and this was ok, it was delivered pretty quickly and the main course was nice and warm still. The food was pretty tasty. My only slight issue was that the air conditioning didn’t cool much. But overall a good stay and a hotel I’d happily stay at again."
801,Genting Hotel,"Lovely hotel but they cancelled my room the day of check in and luckily enough there were spaces but for the cost of the room for one night, I was mortified that this happened. I couldn't get into VIP parking or out of it! Hotel is nice but a fiasco from start to finish."
802,Genting Hotel,Perfect place to stay when in the area or visiting the Arena. Facilities and service are first class along with quality of the food and choice of food available. Would recommend to anyone looking to lay their head down for business or pleasure trip 👍😃
803,Genting Hotel,"I recently stayed at Genting Hotel during my visit to an expo at NEC. The hotel is situated near the exhibition center, which made it extremely convenient. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast offered a nice selection of both hot and cold items, including a full English breakfast buffet. I would definitely recommend Genting Hotel."
804,Genting Hotel,"Lovely smart rooms and facilities, clean, spacious and quiet. Staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Room service took a while and only satisfactory - much better food to be had at local take aways. I would stay here again."
805,Genting Hotel,"Our recent stay at Resorts World Birmingham was fab! Staff were all super friendly and helpful! Room was lovely and clean. We had breakfast in the Sky Bar which was very nice buffet style with a choice of Al a carte eggs which was a nice touch as was the stocked mini fridge in our room, especially after a long journey in traffic with out a stop for food or drink"
806,Genting Hotel,"Stayed for wife’s birthday. Requested upgrades were as advised and all there on arrival. All staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms were great, had everything we needed. Easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go. Overall an enjoyable stay."
807,Genting Hotel,"Might be biased because my boyfriend proposed in the room. But it might be the nicest hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Huge soft bed, modern and clean bathroom with rain fall shower. The only issue is one lift wasn’t working so the wait for the one that was working was VERY long. The reception staff were so lovely and gave us the choice of a room with a bath or a shower. We also got a room on the airport side which is not a full runway view but you do see planes on takeoff and landing which was great. Staff in the casino also so sweet to us as we had no idea what we were doing. And sports bar fantastic aswell, we asked about f1 and the nice Barman put it on the tv closest to us for us. Such a nice hotel and resort, would recommend"
808,Genting Hotel,"We splashed out a bit for the signature room but it was absolutely worth it. The location is perfect for the NEC and the train station (a few minutes walk). The facilities are great - really nice bathrooms, great selection of free toiletries, hot drinks and glass bottled water in the rooms including delicious Nespresso coffee. The spa is free and is high quality, with saunas, pool, hot tub, free fruit and juices. The staff were really friendly and helpful our whole stay. Room service was quick and tasty and available 24 hrs if you arrive during the night. So glad we decided to stay here."
809,Genting Hotel,"First time staying here - so close to NEC Birmingham. Loved the place - spacious and comfortable rooms. Friendly and helpful staff from the guy on Reception to Tracey the late maid who helped explain how the air con worked. Sky Bar was a treat too. Next time, I will explore the Spa as I'm sure it will be good too."
810,Genting Hotel,"Staff excellent, room superb and food in the restaurant reasonably priced and great, best hotel breakfast I have had for ages, if i am working in this area again I certainly would stay again, worth that little extra!"
811,Genting Hotel,"Excellent hotel with fabulous staff. Good location and even though it is in a busy place, it always feels peaceful. We visited for our first anniversary and the staff made sure it was special for us. The bar is wonderful and has a good range of drinks and snacks. Breakfast is a lovely buffet with a fresh fruit bar as well as the usual cereals, pastries and cooked options. The staff in the restaurant were very welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Would definitely recommend"
812,Genting Hotel,"Location for a short stay is great. We had the standard room, no complaints on quality of it or interactions with staff throughout. The shower was amazinf, so powerfull. There are many options for food and drink all in 1 building."
813,Genting Hotel,best hotel and resort if you wanna relax and chill!! the spa and swimming facilities were amazing also it has its own shopping outlet so you can shop on the go i really recommend going with family and friends!
814,Genting Hotel,Great hotel but the friendless of the staff make it stand out. Nothing was too much trouble and everything is done with a smile. A complete transformation from out stay a couple of years ago. We will definitely be back. Thank you!
815,Genting Hotel,"An amazing place to stay for special occasions. The hotel is just second to non, all you need under one roof, being part of Resort world. The staff are so friendly and will go the extra mile, to please you. I would highly recommended"
816,Genting Hotel,"Great staff that saved the day for me. Room staff were great, they gave me what I needed when I needed it. Reception jumped through hoops to get my reservation sorted. I do however recommend that the payment method that you planned to use is possible - for some who dont have a company behind them it could be a problem. For people traveling from the Netherlands - they do not accept maestro - so be prepared."
817,Genting Hotel,Brilliant hotel - best you'll get at the NEC by a distance! The Sky Bar is so nice too! Would recommend staying here (budget allowing) if ever staying at the NEC. Staff were polite and helpful and everything was very clean.
818,Genting Hotel,"Good hotel in ideal spot for Resorts arena or NEC. Clean and tidy, friendly staff. Shame that the spa was fully booked every time we tried to get a slot. Could do with more teabags in the room but will be staying again"
819,Genting Hotel,"Had a great time, really enjoyed myself. Will be definitely going back, the visit was too short so much to do in such a little area. The sight seeing was lovely and the staffs were very help and respectful."
820,Genting Hotel,Lovely hotel. Got a good deal on an accessible room which was fine when travelling for business. Had dinner at Miller and Carter grill next door and the food and service were excellent. I was on my own and they fitted me in at short notice and looked after me!
821,Genting Hotel,"Friendly & helpful staff, clean room and just an overall great experience. We only stayed one night however every single time I came to the front desk for help with luggage or for instance needing milk refill all the staff that I spoke too we're more than happy to help and gave service with a smile. Would happily book again :)"
822,Genting Hotel,"We stayed at the venting hotel after attending an event at the NEC. The hotel is located at resorts world which is on the same complex as the NEC so made it nice and easy to get to. There are lots of things to do surrounding the hotel and many restaurants to choose from. The service was excellent from check in to check out. The spa is a must and nice and relaxing, sadly they did not have spa treatment availability when we stayed despite trying to book in advance but I’m sure it would be great. The only downside in our opinion was the beds/ pillows in the room - the mattress and pillows were extremely hard and both my husband and I woke with back ache. Everything else was faultless."
823,Genting Hotel,"Booked two single rooms for our party, we arrived to an informative member of staff who recommended stuff to do on our stay , our meal in sky was fab, highly recommend the food, also had cocktails which were delicious, also an acoustic duo played on the night time, a really relaxing stay , breakfast also fab , there’s something for everyone at Resorts world , will be re-booking as my family could not fault in any way, The room was spotless and the most comfortable bed in any of my hotels I’ve ever stayed in , faultless stay ."
824,Genting Hotel,What a great place this is to stay. Especially if you like a little flutter in a casino which we do. From check in to check out our experience was fabulous and I can highly recommend. Breakfast was yummy in the Sky By the Water Bar and the cocktails were the best I have ever had. Every member of staff throughout were just the best and so welcoming. Thank you to everyone for looking after us.
825,Genting Hotel,"Couldn’t fault anything with this hotel, the staff, service, rooms, food, bar all exemplary, wouldn’t hesitate to recommend or stay again My room had a huge walk in shower with a waterfall shower head which was definitely a highlight . The setting is amazing so much at your fingertips to do and see ."
826,Genting Hotel,Birthday Celebration - Lovely cocktails in the sky bar - best I've ever tasted! Followed by a fun evening in the sports bar and Casino. Didn't get chance to use the spa - hopefully next time! Great choice at Breakfast too.
827,Genting Hotel,"Was given great service at the reception, secret garden waited for long without even getting drinks, service was slow and lots of confusion. Went on to the spa for us to get to the pool, the moment we walked in we were given some odd type of looks by staff at the spar reception. We were told we were supposed to make a booking first before coming hence was told it was fully packed inside so no space for us to go in. Our mood was negatively affected as all of us had planned out activity’s. Went back to the rooms till 9pm and went for dinner, sky restaurant service was amazing and made us feel good."
828,Genting Hotel,The treatment we got from the hotel spa staff was unprofessional we were told that to go into the spa we had to book yet the receptionist confirmed that we were allowed to walk in between the hours of 6pm to 10pm unfortunately the staff were rude and unprofessional towards us hence this affected our visit negatively. The only place we got excellent service was at the sky by water restaurant were staff delivered excellent and exceptional service to us which made the trip more pleasant and enjoyable.
829,Genting Hotel,"Nice location bit over priced for the rooms and think breakfast should be included for the price ,but overall nice hotel and very clean . Reception staff very polite and helpful on arrival and departure ."
830,Genting Hotel,If you have a concert or atteneding a event this is perfect - I feel the price of the hotel is very high for what it was but but over all was ok. - The only issue we had was the window would not shut correctly and this meant you herd all the nose and wind. This kept us awake and made the room cold. -
831,Genting Hotel,Excellent customer service Very clean n smart Close to arena Would defo recommend to friends and family and wud defo use again Lots of facilities and shops and restaurants Massive spacious room great layout
832,Genting Hotel,"My daughter and I stayed at the Genting Hotel Resorts World as part of our trip to see Olly Murs at Resorts World Arena. There was a bizarre coincidence at check-in when we were allocated the same room as another party. The receptionist could not apologise enough and offered each member of both parties, a complimentary breakfast. We had a lovely stay and will definitely be staying there again."
833,Genting Hotel,"Great service and staff friendly. Nice beds very comfortable. Great bar. Unfortunately breakfast let it down for me as buffet... dry black pudding, watery eggs, watery bacon. Sliding toaster not a fan! Never toasts enough and people forget which is their bread/toast and build up of queues unnecessarily. Great choice of fruit, yogurt, cheeses meat and cereal though!"
834,Genting Hotel,"Very nice & clean room, spa lovely and quiet both in the evening and early morning, outdoor hot tub was particularly good. Option to use the gym is great. Room service was excellent and very friendly staff! Would return!"
835,Genting Hotel,I rang ahead and said I was a light sleeper and could I have a room away from the lifts I was put at the end of a corridor but all I heard all night was the motorway traffic I even checked the windows were shut properly. The time before I had stayed saying the same and had a lovely nights sleep but apparently I was the wrong side of the hotel and they said to tell them next time and they would put me on the other side
836,Genting Hotel,"I visited here with my partner for one day in the suite and was not disappointed the workers at reception in the spa and main hotel were very friendly and helpful with any queries I had the quality of the room was great and spacious the bathroom was very clean and can not fault they even leave you a information leaflet on how to work certain things in your room along with some complimentary snacks, cold drinks and hot drinks. Overall 10/10 experience highly recommend"
837,Genting Hotel,"A very good run hotel,the staff being very friendly and welcoming with the food in the restaurant at an excellent standard for breakfast, would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the area."
838,Genting Hotel,From booking to check out perfect stay… room had lovely views of lake … comfy bed ..amazing nights sleep … chose superior which gained acces to vip parking & well stocked mini bar … shower was lovely with amazing toiletries Looking forward to booking again
839,Genting Hotel,"Booked a suite at this hotel today drove 250 miles waited till 3pm till check in with a que of people also awaiting rooms,then found the suite was given to someone else so we had to wait for another room.I spoke with the manager and said its not acceptable then was told she would ring housekeeping to sort it ,finally the Kuala lump suite was ready she said so off we went to the 5 th floor to find the bed wasnt made room not cleaned...FUMING back down to the reception again to complain now still waiting on our suite with a full refund and a complimentary drink in the bar...I WILL NOT BE STAYING HERE AGAIN AND WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM...."
840,Genting Hotel,"Fabulous stay everything under one roof , cocktail in sky bar amazing and the spa well just what we needed used on arrival and next morning Very friendly staff throughout Room I paid for standard but wow it was amazing We parked under in vip and was well worth it It was fab just what we needed Many thanks"
841,Genting Hotel,"Loved everything about this hotel, I would recommend this hotel to everyone I know. There was so much fun things to do for all age groups. The spa was my favourite part it’s so relaxing and clean. 10/10"
842,Genting Hotel,"Very nice hotel .. quiet,clean, comfortable, great location , convenient, warm enough, enough staff. Buffet breakfast is ok, but toaster could be in a better place. The restaurant is spectacular for a special meal. Wonderful view. Would have got 5 stars if one of the four receptionists with No customers could have served us a drink in the bar.. and we could have had more than one teabag each in the toom. Will most probably come back. Recommended."
843,Genting Hotel,Spent a night in this suite prior to a trip to Mexico for my wife's 50th. A very large and spacious suite or more like an apartment. The hotel is also very nice and very well located near Birmingham Airport. Food choices are also good as well as possible shopping options. We will stay again.
844,Genting Hotel,"I chose this hotel for it's convenience for the Genting Arena. I usually stay somewhere else when visiting the arena. But this hotel is the best. Everything is there clise to hand making it all so easy. Beautiful hotel, friendly & professional staff, spacious/comforatable/clean room, restaurant with a view, quality food and brand new spa."
845,Genting Hotel,"The hotel was very clean, the Staff excellent everywhere and cannot be faulted. As I cannot drink wine I was disappointed a little bit with Sky on the Water and the Hospitality Suite at the Resort as no provision was made for this."
846,Genting Hotel,"Stayed here recently. upgraded to a superior room which came with free parking and free mini bar. Excellent spa with outdoor jacuzzi. Eat at Miller and Carter which was very good . Plenty to do in the complex shopping cinema , ten pin bowling etc Breakfast was very nice."
847,Genting Hotel,"We only stayed here for one night, but were surprised by the hotel's quality of service. We had a huge bedroom with an enormous bath. Staff were friendly and pleasant. Overlooked the NEC and easy to stroll down through the lagoon front. With Nando's restaurant which my wife enjoyed the food. Good restaurant-great buffet. All in all-pleasant hotel for short stay or long stay."
848,Genting Hotel,"On arrival I received a warm welcome by the staff on duty, was great reception. The process of checking in was seamless. I was giving a recap of all the services available for make my stay enjoyable and relaxing. Fantastic complex and location that has all amenities within the visibility for my pleasure. I strongly recommend this hotel."
849,Genting Hotel,"A nice Spa Day Stay Over. Nice room, the Spa was superb. Lovely breakfast and meal in the Sky By The Water Bar. The room was clean, the mini bar was well stocked. The espa shower gel and shampoo added a little class to the stop over."
850,Hotel Cristina,This is a very comfortable hotel with magnificent views across St. Aubins Bay. The staff are very friendly and helpful . The service in the Restaurant and Bar is very good. If you are travelling to the hotel by car it is best to approach it coming down the hill on Mont Felard heading towards the bay. This is because there is a very tight left hand turn into the drive if you approach from Victoria Avenue which is not advised.
851,Hotel Cristina,"lovely hotel with great views over the bay. Food was excellent and the staff very helpful. Pool was in a sun trap so the windy conditions during our stay didnt impact us too much, we were able to sit out and relax by the pool"
852,Hotel Cristina,"Loved everything about this hotel! I would definitely recommend it! Being in an elevated position the views from the sea facing balconies are beautiful! Just about every staff member was pleasant, helpful and efficient."
853,Hotel Cristina,Nice hotel with views. All the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are a bit smaller than expected and the soundproofing was not very good. Breakfast buffet food was often cold as was the toast and coffee
854,Hotel Cristina,"Lovely, friendly hotel. Breakfast had a great selection of either continental or full English. Lots of steps to the hotel or long walk up steep driveway. Buses readily available, nice walk along the front to St Helier or St Aubins. Lots of restaurants and pubs for eating and drinking."
855,Hotel Cristina,We were here for work we had a Fantastic stay 3of us stayed the hotel was lovely the staff were all amazing and very friendly .The breakfasts were great plenty of choice and i managed to get a few afternoons around the pool which was spotless with a fantastic view even the car park was a great size and we had work vans .
856,Hotel Cristina,Stunning views over the bay from the terrace bar and restaurant. Friendly and helpful staff. Lovely pool area. Clean and comfortable rooms. Lots of space to relax within the hotel. Good location on the bay for walking into St Heleier or St Aubin in you don't mind the climb back to the hotel. All made for an enjoyable stay.
857,Hotel Cristina,"We arrived on Tuesday 30th May 2023, when we left Jersey airport and headed for the hotel you can get the no.15 bus or you can get a taxi. The bus is around £5 whereas the taxi is around £20. It also takes twice as long on the bus. When we got off the bus at Coronation Park, we went up La Rude de Haut where there was a signpost telling us Hotel Cristina was up that road, La Rude de Haut is really only a pedestriation route to Hotel Cristina if you are coming in a car or taxi just go straight to the hotel entrance. So, once we went up the road which again was signposted, it was a bit steep so for people with ability issues you may want to consider a taxi. After that first signpost we did not see another one and so we kept going up the road which eventually lead to us realzing…"
858,Hotel Cristina,"Staff were lovely - all so helpful & friendly. It’s difficult to single out particular staff as each person gave 100%. The menu was new & the food we had was lovely. I can recommend the small plates of tapas in the afternoons - a little taste sensation. The hotel was spotlessly clean & this was maintained throughout the day. Some minor tweaks with the wifi in areas, but this hotel is gorgeous, beautifully maintained & with stunning views. Go see for yourself."
859,Hotel Cristina,"This hotel is lovely and has great views. Had one overnight stay. None of us could sleep beds were very uncomfortable, we was all so tired the next day we had to pay for late checkout just to try and get rest. Food and drinks overpriced. Spent over £300 and only had one evening meal with a few drinks. If a larger family went for a week the cost would be silly."
860,Hotel Cristina,"Attractive, clean, comfortable, with a very high level of customer service. The dining and bar team, in particular, provide cheerful service that made a difference In our stay. At the end of the day, a drink or a tea on the terrace, with a view of the nearby bay, is a highlight."
861,Hotel Cristina,"We came to Jersey for a few days in our wedding anniversary week. The weather was good and the hotel exactly what we had hoped for. The room was well appointed with generous tea and coffee supplies and bathroom essentials. Plugs, mirrors etc all helpfully positioned and the view from both windows was fantastic. We did not hire a car but used the very comprehensive bus system and walked between routes when necessary. There are a lot of steps up to the hotel ( which got easier as the week went on!) but not a problem if you are reasonably fit. If you have mobility issues, hire a car for better access. Thoroughly recommend a stay here."
862,Hotel Cristina,Fantastic hotel with very nice and helpful staff. Nothing negative to say. Rooms very well looked after and clean. Ask for a room over looking pool area as has little terrace Sea views from the terrace are amazing.
863,Hotel Cristina,"Perfect short break with incredible staff - very friendly and helpful. Only downside was that the rooms would be very hot in summer as no air con, although fans are available from reception for use in the bedrooms."
864,Hotel Cristina,We had an overnight stay here for a birthday celebration. The food was excellent and all the staff are very friendly and efficient. Room 1 is particularly charming with tasteful decor and extremely spacious.
865,Hotel Cristina,"The hotel is in an excellent location with beautiful views. The staff are all polite, friendly and helpful. Perfect for a relaxing holiday. It’s close to the main bus routes which makes getting around easy."
866,Hotel Cristina,"Room spacious enoigh. We had a sea view and the view was stunning. The staff are very polite, helpful and look like they enjoy working there. Always a bright hello and nothing too much trouble. Would definitely stay here again. Restaurant was lovely, bit pricey compare to the UK but normal for a hotel."
867,Hotel Cristina,"Just back from a 5 day break at The Cristina Hotel in Lawrence. From check-in we were looked after by the fantastic staff they have, nothing too much trouble always smiling and attentive. Will definitely be back to hotel again."
868,Hotel Cristina,Really enjoyed our little break in jersey hotel lovely upgraded our room to a sea view with balcony definitely worth doing staff very pleasant and can’t do enough for you food very nice only downside was the walk back up to the hotel apart from that would highly recommend the hotel hopefully be back sometime in September
869,Hotel Cristina,"Fantastic hotel, lovely view of the bay, staff very friendly going out of their way to ensure we enjoy our stay as much as possible. We have dined in twice and found the food to be excellent. The breakfast choice is extensive and we never leave the hotel in the morning hungry. Would definitely stay here again"
870,Hotel Cristina,"Hotel Cristina, the best hotel we have stayed in, in Jersey. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. The cuisine excellent. We did not take the car and had no problems with the local bus service."
871,Hotel Cristina,Hotel Cristina was just as it was described. The food was amazing throughout. The staff were always on hand and very friendly and the reception staff couldn't have been more helpful. The hotel was just what we needed for a long weekend away to visit Jersey.
872,Hotel Cristina,"This was the first ""proper"" holiday we've had for some years now. It might have only been a long weekend in Jersey, but it was just what we needed to get into the holiday mood again. Jersey is beautiful. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a beautiful, peaceful and relaxing long weekend (or week) away. We booked the hotel as part of a package deal and we didn't pay too much attention to the hotel. However, it was great. The location of the hotel is perfect. Central south location, not too far from the airport or St Helier, but far enough away to be peaceful. Everything we wanted to visit seemed to be a 15 minute drive away. We were lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to a sea-view room. I'm glad we did, as it was stunning and I can't image the…"
873,Hotel Cristina,"We're just back from a superb stay at Hotel Cristina (05.05.2023 to 08.05.2023 and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the lovely Victoria on reception through to our final departure we couldn't have asked for a better stay on our first visit to Jersey. The hotel is perfectly placed for fantastic views across the bay, which were enhanced even further thanks to a complimentary upgrade to a sea view room with balcony, a totally unexpected surprise. It has to be said, however, that access to the hotel could be a problem for the less able but this is purely down to its location at the top of a hill The staff at the hotel are amazing, so welcoming, cheerful and chatty, and it wouldn't be right to single anyone out so, suffice to say, the…"
874,Hotel Cristina,Superb view over St Aubins bay. Nice hotel which has a very good location with good food and very friendly staff. To walk to the fantastic beach there is a footpath from the hotel gardens which leads to a local road then to the beach.
875,Hotel Cristina,"Beautiful hotel with amazing views. We were given a complimentary room upgrade with a sea-view which made our holiday. Super cosy beds, had the best sleep. Very attentive and friendly staff. Lovely food. After a long day walking around the island , The Christina was a little bit of paradise to come back to."
876,Hotel Cristina,"Friendly, clean and comfortable. Fantastic evening meals. Beautiful views overlooking the bay. Great location for walking between St Aubins or St Helier along the promenade. 10 min walk to the seafront."
877,Hotel Cristina,"From the moment we stepped through the door to time we departed, absolutely everything was outstanding. Warmest welcome, Superb staff, fantastic food, live music subtly seducing our ears. Big thumbs up for breakfast too!"
878,Hotel Cristina,"We booked this as a last minute staycation, and the first with our new born baby (4 weeks old). The staff were very helpful, set up a cot in the room prior to arrival, and gave us extra space at dinner / breakfast for the pram."
879,Hotel Cristina,"The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was was well equipped and very clean. I don’t understand why a review has to be 200 characters. I am giving my review is short, sweet and to the point. Maybe you should reconsider the characters?"
880,Hotel Cristina,"Excellent food and services provided by all staff - reception, bar, restaurant and chambermaid. Good place to stay for both visitors to Jersey and local residents. Out of season offers to local residents very good value."
881,Hotel Cristina,"First the location. Views are truly amazing. Sitting on the terrace enjoying a glass of wine in the sunshine - pure bliss. Close to attractions and bus stop. Rooms are comfortable, clean and quiet. Food and drinks are so good. Every meal we had was really well prepared. The chef knows what he is doing. Last but not least is the lovely staff. They work very hard to ensure guests are happy. Would definitely recommend staying here."
882,Hotel Cristina,Great property which we stayed at short notice due to our flight home being cancelled. The staff were more than welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. The room was large and spotlessly clean with fantastic views of St Aubin Bay.
883,Hotel Cristina,"Had a local’s staycation and have been to Cristina before. It is a gorgeous hotel with excellent food, rooms and views. What makes this hotel even more special is the team that work there. They are friendly, welcoming and nothing is to much trouble. Will definitely gonback!"
884,Hotel Cristina,"Prior to retirement I experienced a very substantial number of hotel stays .This hotel was without doubt one of the best.The staff at all levels are excellent .One in particular Gina, was way and beyond anything I have experienced before. The view is superb and in the right weather the pool would be very good (we did not have good weather). The dinner experience was certainly not cheap but the quality was excellent . I did feel that there was room for improvement with the breakfast buffet (temperature of food, more breads ,butter or spreads,more cutlery ie. spoons).The terrace and adjoining gardens were very ,very good. If it were not for the buffet I would give the hotel 10 rather than 9.5"
885,Hotel Cristina,"Lovely positioned hotel, with stunning views. But its a slog uphill, so not for the infirm. Breakfast lovely, staff exceptional. Now the minus points in my opinion. No complimentary toiletries, plastic cups in the bathroom, no mini fridge in the bedroom, bathrooms dated, bowl of crisps with drinks, charged for. Only silly things, however they add up. This isn’t a 2 star hotel. These things should be included in the rate. If you must charge for a bowl of crisps, add £5 on the room rate! Just makes the hotel appear a bit naff. Plastic cellophane clad cups In the bathroom☹️ this isn’t a travel lodge! No fridge! Surely that’s obligatory in a hotel of this standard? Over all a lovely stay, world return, but those bathrooms…. 80s!!"
886,Hotel Cristina,"Went for a wedding last September and decided there & then that we'd go back & stay. Lovely hotel with friendly staff makes a nice, relaxing break. Would definitely recommend. Oh and the view is stunning!"
887,Hotel Cristina,"The hotel was in a beautiful location with fantastic views. The staff were superb - genuinely friendly, welcoming and helpful. The rooms were very clean and lots of biscuits, tea bags, coffee and milk provided."
888,Hotel Cristina,"I had an overnight stay here and it was very enjoyable. I was made to feel very welcome and valued. There was a private function going on, but it did not impact on any aspect of my stay. I would gladly stay here again and would highly recommend the hotel to others."
889,Hotel Cristina,A beautiful place with some fantastic views across the bay. Wonderful food and some lovely helpful staff. We could not rate this place any better . Jersey is a wonderful place and we could not stay anywhere else other than the Hotel Cristina
890,Hotel Cristina,"Not often I write reviews but credit where credits due. Stunning hotel amazing views. Very relaxing environment, clean, friendly and very nice and accommodating staff. Food is the best I've had in years. Not often I walk away feeling I got my money's worth but on this occasion it was worth every penny."
891,Hotel Cristina,"Stayed here for 3 nights & wasn't disappointed. The hotel sits high up so has spectacular views across the bay. The breakfast/restaurant & bar all face the sea, which is great. The food is exceptional. The staff are polite and friendly & nothing is too much trouble. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and we will definitely return."
892,Hotel Cristina,"Came from guernsey for a week away. Couldn’t really fault it. We had the car so needed somewhere with parking and not too far from st Helier. When we arrived they upgraded us to the balcony sea view room which was a lovely surprise as I only booked inland view. The view was beautiful and it made you feel like you where on a Caribbean island from the view. The staff where very friendly and our room got cleaned/tidied everyday. The only thing I could nit pick about was that if you don’t pay for breakfast included it is a bit on the expensive side, and the bathroom had a couple of hairs when we arrived but apart from that I loved the stay and will definitely be returning next year! :)"
893,Hotel Cristina,Really good friendly hotel in fantastic location. Friendly obliging staff and great breakfast menu.Clean and well presented.only real concern was access by car from Road which is very tricky in a small car didn’t try in a large one!
894,Hotel Cristina,"Superb time at this amazing hotel, fantastic service & food was delicious with great choices, wine & cocktails were also delicious, views truly spectacular from the lovely terrace and our balcony overlooking the whole bay."
895,Hotel Cristina,Lovley Hotel inbetween st Aubin and st Helier. Lovley comfortable rooms with amazing panoramic views. Beds are so comfortable .loved the complimentary toiletries in bathroom . Staff are great can’t do enough for you and very helpful and friendly .They made our stay very welcoming . We stayed bed breakfast breakfast was part buffet cereals fruit juice cold meats .there was menu you could order off with good choice . I wouldn’t recommend this hotel if you have mobility issues as there’s about 70 steps up to the hotel quite steep near the bottom . Hotel is situated on hillside has lovely gardens outside. There is a patio area outside with parasols table chairs would be lovely in summer months. There’s swimming pool outside but not open until May . There’s bus stop near coronation…
896,Hotel Cristina,"The hotel is lovely,and the staff that make the experience. Nothing was ever too much trouble, staff went out of their way to ensure we had a good stay. We stayed in a sea view balcony room which was beautiful. Breakfast was delicious! Thank you Hotel Cristina! Should we ever return to Jersey; we’ll be sure to return to the Hotel Cristina."
897,Hotel Cristina,"Lunch on the terrace at the Hotel Cristina Jersey always a pleasure. At random on Easter Friday we decided to have lunch at Cristina, it was exceptional. All the staff without exception were ultra friendly and efficient and most important the quality of the lunch was superb. I chose the Seafood Linguine, well I have eaten the same on the Italian Riviera, the ultimate, but this was of the same quality. Well done Cristina for making us feel welcome and relaxed and delivering high quality food."
898,Hotel Cristina,Friendly and outstanding service from all staff. And a beautiful hotel apparently refurbished and shows. Gorgeous buffet breakfast with really lovely hot food choice on top if wanted. Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to others and we will be back.
899,Hotel Cristina,Early autumn break to Hotel Christina. Located on a hill on the outskirts of St Helier overlooking the sea and Elizabeth Castle. Nice room overlooking sea. Breakfast included in our package and Restaurant very good for evening meals. Entrance road very difficult to get in from bottom of hill much better to go past and come back down hill.
900,Grand Central Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, great location, but, the breakfasts were poor for a 5* hotel. Everything was luke warm. They served margarine with toast, the fried eggs had a skin on them, the sausages were cheap and not meaty, the fruit salad was tasteless and had only basics fruits in it, ie, apples, a few chunks of pineapple, and a few bits of melon. To top it Al the coffee wasn't good either. Fir this reason, I wouldn't stop here again. We paid £700 for 2 nights, so I would've expected more. Ian on conceigrge was very helpful and kind."
901,Grand Central Hotel,We can not say enough about our experience at the Observatory Bar. We had a birthday party for our sister. We loved everything from start to finish. Your host Pauline was so happy and danced and sang for us. Then up the lift we went and greeted by Trisha. She was ready for us with smiles and laughs. We sat on the most gorgeous sofa and Trisha explained everything. She knew my sister was vegetarian and explained how she would have a few substitutions but reassured everything was still good. We even upgraded for the champagne special. We had Kimmy help us choose teas. There was one girl who brought the food who wasn’t so polite but the others made up for it. Our sandwiches were nice and the best treat was the piece of cake Trisha surprised us with. She even had a candle. We all…
902,Grand Central Hotel,"Having watched the TV program highlighting the Grand Central, Europa and the Hastings Group we decided as this year was our 40th Wedding Anniversary we would stay at the Grand Central. This was our third time in Belfast and previously stayed at the Maldron and how I wish we had returned to it. I emailed the hotel on several occasions and asked that a bouquet of seasonal flowers to be in our room on arrival. This failed and so did a lot more things in our weeks stay. The room was comfortable with a great bed, bedding and pillows but there it goes downhill. On numerous occasions we had to request teabags, milk, hand towels, face cloths and worst of all toilet rolls. Room servicing left a lot to be desired and needs tightening up, in fact we have had better servicing at lower star…"
903,Grand Central Hotel,"This was our first trip to Belfast and I’m so glad we chose The Grand Central to stay at! Fabulous hotel with great facilities! Breakfast buffet was delicious! And I have to do a shout out to Maeve, Rebekkah and Nora for their 5* service! Thank you!"
904,Grand Central Hotel,"An amazing experience with grand central especially from Maeve, Nora and Rebekkah, they took care of sorting our rooms out to be available straight on arrival, any queries about where to go for food or the hotel bar were answered! Overall a very hospitable environment with such friendly staff!"
905,Grand Central Hotel,"Amazing stay, Maeve, Rebekkah and Nora very accommodating and made our stay super easy with us not having to worry about a thing! I would recommend this hotel for any business that is coming to Belfast for a trip, or any trip for any occasion. Super stay."
906,Grand Central Hotel,"Beautiful hotel in a great location, staff couldn’t be more helpful and friendly. Special shout out to Maeve, Rebekah and Nora for going above and beyond! Very comfortable bedrooms and lovely breakfast. Can’t wait to revisit on our next trip over."
907,Grand Central Hotel,"Maeve, Nora & Rebekkah were great!! We felt super welcome and looked after from the second we checked in. Will definitely go back when we’re next in Belfast! Great amenities for everyone, lovely cocktail bar and spa and restaurant is great."
908,Grand Central Hotel,I have stayed in this hotel 3 times now & it is absolutely superb from comfort to customer service! On my last stay I checked in with Matthew who was absolutely excellent & very helpful. If I could give him more than 5 stars I would … the rooms are very comfortable & luxurious! The observatory bar is absolutely amazing 🤩 I also had dinner in the restaurant each time I stayed just delicious 😋 I can’t wait for my next visit. Thank you Matthew & staff 🙏
909,Grand Central Hotel,"Well, what started off rocky was turned around. The team here are wonderful. When checking in we couldnt find my booking. But they still found a room for me They were so nice about it!! I was in a wonderful room on the 18th floor. The bed so lovely and comfy. Thank you to Nial for helping me get all my suitecases to the room. I then went upstsirs and was greeted by theamerican maanger who was so much fun and made me laugh as she joked she was taking me to the worst table but the view from the corner was better then i could even express. Not being a big drinker but wanted a cocktail she went over options and even made a change to a drink for me. It was the best. The team was full of life and fun. A must go for all. The next day breakfast was good. The team went over…"
910,Grand Central Hotel,"I visited the seahorse restaurant with my husband for our anniversary. Had the tasting menu … amazing food, amazing staff and service. Thank you so much and a special thank you to one of the staff Rachel Baird who was so informative and helpful."
911,Grand Central Hotel,"We stayed here in Belfast for just one night and wished we had more time. From the moment we arrived Niall, the Concierge, was friendly and helpful. He recommended a few places to eat and we chose the Sweet Afton, which we loved. We ate breakfast here, which was included with our rooms, and loved the experience. The buffet has incredible breakfast offerings. Lots of options, plus you can order from the menu. Our room had a spacious sitting area, very comfortable bed, and came with two robes and slippers. We were a party of six in three rooms and we all loved our stay here and will miss it as we push on with our tour of Ireland. Thanks for the exceptional service!"
912,Grand Central Hotel,"We stayed at the Grand Central hotel in Belfast in Nov 22 and again in December, and it was an absolutely brilliant break in both occasions. The hotel itself is immaculate and well situated close to everything we wanted to visit. The staff were lovely, attentive and welcoming without being obtrusive. The rooms were very spacious and very clean with amazing views over Belfast city. We also dined in both of the restaurants which were lovely and had cocktails in The Observatory Bar which was just amazing! All in all would totally recommend this hotel and a visit to Belfast, and we’ll definitely be returning!"
913,Grand Central Hotel,"So happy we decided to stay at this fabulous hotel. Staff - professional and very friendly. Rooms - spotless, luxurious and comfortable Food - only had breakfast and this was delicious Location - very convenient to shops & restaurants Would highly recommend this hotel but just 1 criticism - the price of drinks in the 23rd floor observatory bar - way overpriced be warned"
914,Grand Central Hotel,We have never stayed at such a welcoming and efficient hotel and we have stayed at a few. It was so lovely staying in a hotel where all staff were friendly informative and efficient. The other plus for us was that you had a choice of places to eat drink or just sit - most hotels have ceased having those facilities. The observatory bar was well worth a visit but the lounge bar was such a relaxing and lovely place to sit. Also the drinks and food were good. We dined at the seahorse restaurant and also the ground floor restaurant- both excellent and following recommendations from John the concierge and other members of staff dined at other excellent restaurants. This is one hotel we will definitely recommend and hope to return to soon.
915,Grand Central Hotel,"Was refused entry to observatory bar as I was wearing shorts.. in the middle of the day, in the warmest Saturday of 2023 so far The shorts were nice dress chino shorts, (not sport shorts) What year are we living in? If that’s there attitude, gladly won’t return…"
916,Grand Central Hotel,We stayed at the Grand for four nights on the eighteenth floor our room was very clean with plenty of towels etc As we can’t have UHT milk it would be very useful to have small fridges in the rooms to keep fresh milk ! On our first night we ate down stairs as the main restaurant wasn’t open hand on my heart I wouldn’t write home about the food the service was ok staff very nice and helpful ! We found John Mac goes the extra mile to help in any way he can he even went out to Tesco to see if he could find me a hot water bottle this we very much appreciated! Thank you John for your kindness
917,Grand Central Hotel,"Great service, top notch cleanliness; brilliant hotel overall. It is centrally located and everything is within walking distance. The staff will delight you with their warmth in true signature Irish style."
918,Grand Central Hotel,"Recently dined in the Seahorse Restaurant in Grand Central, availed of the Tasting Menu with paired wines. What an experience, the food and service was fantastic and the professional and friendly staff guided and explained us through each course which was impressive. A lovely friendly ambience throughout all of the hotel. Can’t wait to return!"
919,Grand Central Hotel,"I did not stay at Grand Central, however, I had drinks at Skybar at the top of the hotel. Our experience, the view and the drinks were wonderful. However, upon returning to our own hotel, I realized that I was missing my jacket. I was on a tour of Ireland and was distraught about losing my only jacket. We called Skybar and they did not have the coat. Then we walked back to Grand Central to see if I had left it on a bathroom hook. No luck. As we were leaving, we were approached by the Head Porter, John Mac. He offered to help but we assured him we had checked everywhere and talked to everyone who might be able to help. Once again we left Grand Central and headed back to our hotel. After walking for two blocks, I was shocked to turn around and find John Mac racing after us! He…"
920,Grand Central Hotel,Room was nice but all controls were very complicated. For some reason the lights went off and you had to use one switch on one side of the bed to turn them back on. I could not get them to work and finally had to contact someone from the front desk. The shower was small and again had complicated controls between the shower and the spray. Water easily sprayed onto the floor making for a very dangerous situation. I never did figure out how to use the AC (if it worked at all) so the room heated up considerably and was uncomfortable. I only stayed one night. Hotel was booked by a colleague so i would not recommend.
921,Grand Central Hotel,"Hotel is very nice and rooms are top drawer. However, this hotel is not set up for people on vacation. 1. Room wasn’t made up at 3.30 in the afternoon. Having been out all day, the last thing you need is a late room make up. 2. This issue is mentioned lots in feedback . The Observatory bar, Pretentious doesn’t begin to describe the attitude of the staff. We went up just after 3 ( when it opens) as our room hadn’t yet been made up . ( see above …) we thought we would enjoy the spectacular views with a drink while awaiting the room service. The bar was empty ( we will uk ls have been first customers) however I was told I wouldn’t be served as I had “ sportswear “on ( sneakers ) . I’m on my holiday staying as a resident in your hotel ! If you think I’m putting on a suit to…"
922,Grand Central Hotel,I recently took a friend to the conservatory for early evening drinks. I felt that that we were somehow judged as soon as we walked in. We were shown to a seat beside the bar which was a bit like sitting in a store room. This seemed odd given how many much nicer seats were available. We moved to a different table but it seemed to annoy the senior member of staff who had initially placed us beside the stacked up wine coolers. The drinks were very expensive but I knew this from previous visits. Thankfully my friend enjoyed the views but sadly on this occasion I found the atmosphere very stilted and unfriendly. I will not be back.
923,Grand Central Hotel,"Absolutely wonderful place. Very accommodating and helpful. Pristine rooms, great central location. Restaurant is brilliant. I’m here on business, and probably wouldn’t have been able to afford it if I wasn’t, but if I could, I’d 100% stay here again."
924,Grand Central Hotel,Horrible experience with the front desk staff at this hotel. They have a really bad attitude and all because I asked for a later checkout? They need a lesson in decorum. As someone who travels a lot for his work I would never stay at this hotel because of the staff. Rooms are nothing special either.
925,Grand Central Hotel,"We enjoyed another lovely stay in The Grand Central Hotel, our favourite Belfast hotel. The roof top observatory is a must, with amazing views of the city. A special mention for John Mac the concierge who is courteous, helpful and a""wee gem""."
926,Grand Central Hotel,"So, your getting married. In Belfast City Hall. Where would you stay? Look no further! For the special day, we had a few special requests. We needed to book in early for my (now) wife to get ready. We needed to surprise our parents, who thought they were meeting us for afternoon tea, with the news that they would be witnesses at the ceremony. We got all of this and more! Nothing was too much trouble for the dynamic duo that were Joanne and Matthew. From the moment we arrived they were perfection. Nothing was a problem. Our room was beautiful, clean and comfortable with stunning views of Belfast and and the Lough. We were surprised with chocolates, cakes and macaroons, and a message wishing us all the best, which we were touched by. Matthew channelled his inner spy, sneaking…"
927,Grand Central Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay in grand central.Rooms are spotless,breakfast really good and the staff are so helpful & friendly. The rooftop bar is a great place to enjoy a cocktail. John Mc was a pleasure to deal with. We will definitely return soon!"
928,Grand Central Hotel,"we've recently returned from our 2 night stay at the Grand Hotel Belfast. On arrival we were 30 mins early we asked if we could check in and the receptionist said this was possible but could only offer room on floor 8 which wasn't a issue but if we like to return at 3 she could offer us a room on 17th floor we decided to wait and had a drink at the bar. we then checked in and went to our room which was lovely only to find electrics were not working on all plugs we immediately raised the issue and the lady who I think was manager could not apologise enough and immediately gave us a upgrade for larger room on 22nd floor 1 word WOW. Room had an extra bed bath and shower, and the views were amazing. we finished our last night in the bar on top floor we were greeted by Will we…"
929,Grand Central Hotel,I stayed at this hotel for 5 days. Very clean and modern room and an amazing view.Great location. The breakfast buffet was not what we expected.very limited choices and we didn’t like it. But restaurants were clean and very modern atmosphere.
930,Grand Central Hotel,"I treated my daughter to afternoon tea in the Observatory at Belfast's Grand Central Hotel yesterday and we thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The sandwiches were so fresh and the best we have had at afternoon tea anywhere. Home made scones were perfect and the talented pastry chef had created sweet treats which tasted as amazing as they looked. Views out over Belfast are of course fantastic. Many thanks to Mary Ellen , Tricia and all her team who so warmly welcomed us and helped make our visit even better. Thoroughly recommend this for a special occasion or just part of a lovely day out."
931,Grand Central Hotel,"This is a beautiful hotel in an absolutely lovely location near the centre of Belfast city! We loved the warmth and easy efficiency of the hotel staff - from the concierge, reception staff, bell-boys, room service, housekeeping and the staff at their Sea Horse restaurant…a special mention for Terry here, who was energetic, super quick and friendly :) The rooms are spacious, well maintained and well lit, with nice city views. The bathrooms are large and beautiful and very well appointed. Sustainability seems to be at the heart of this hotel and is much appreciated as well 😊"
932,Grand Central Hotel,"Superb Stay ... Stayed here recently on a business trip. Well it was an enjoyable one. Networked during the day in the hotel cafe which suits its name ""Grand Cafe"". Then went out to enjoy golf with work colleagues. We arrived back and all of our bags were neatly in our room. Enjoyed a few cocktails in the observatory bar. WOW tallest cocktail bar in Ireland. What a view. Breakfast next morning was superb. The fact they had a full house night before was impressive. As we had no wait for breakfast. Cant wait to come back GC N D"
933,Grand Central Hotel,I had another great stay at one of my favourite hotels. This time with my son prior to a trip to England. Enjoyed a quick meal in the cafe and had a good nights sleep despite our early start. Super stay - thank you to all the friendly team who looked after us. Can’t wait to return.
934,Grand Central Hotel,Excellent hotel. Accommodations and service superb. Location of hotel was great. Delicious breakfast. View from the bar spectacular. One of our favorite stays while visiting Belfast. I can’t say much more … no weak link.
935,Grand Central Hotel,"Rude obnoxious staff in reception. Nice hotel but we will not return. Was accused of not paying for the rooms. A very aggressive lady would Brook no argument or discussion. Luckily my sister had a digital receipt which was snapped , checked and handed back without an apology. Was it our southern accents that so triggered same lady???"
936,Grand Central Hotel,Visited here before my visit to Derry and it was absolutely shocking service from start to finish. How this hotel is described as 5* is beyond me. no attentiveness from any of the staff and service was slow beyond belief. Prices in the observatory bar are also shocking. Avoid avoid avoid.
937,Grand Central Hotel,"Wow… have travelled all over the world, sadly, this was the worst service EVER. Supposedly highly rated. So maybe we all hit them on a bad day. Rooms were fine. No in-hotel fitness center. Power was out in the room when we woke up. Dinner took THREE hours! Had drinks upstairs in the observatory and the service there was no better. Would never return here nor recommend to anyone else."
938,Grand Central Hotel,"Friendly staff, clean hotel and really comfortable beds - central location recommended the double double room as they come with free standing bath and walk-in shower plenty of room for four ladies on a girls weekend - birthday cupcakes a nice gesture from manager"
939,Grand Central Hotel,"We went for coffee, tea and toast. We got a lovely pot of tea and a coffee. Our tea and coffee and toast plus jam and marmalade was served very quickly. We sat and took in the excellent surrounds of the hotel. Everything was excellent. The young girl who served us was very polite and pleasant. I apologise for not catching her name but it was around 10.00 on Monday morning 15 May 2023. Many thanks Grand Central."
940,Grand Central Hotel,We visited the Grand Central Hotel at the weekend and had a very tasty lunch in the Café served by the very efficient Phillip. On to cocktails in the Observatory bar 23rd floor where we were greeted by the very friendly Mary Ellen (who settled our dispute over whether the bar was the tallest building or bar in Ireland!) The cocktails were very nice but it was the view that we enjoyed the most. Would definitely visit again!
941,Grand Central Hotel,We had a fantastic stay this weekend! From start to finish the quality and service was excellent. Rooms are impeccable and spacious. Special mention to John Mac who was excellent and extremely helpful throughout our stay. We will be back :-)
942,Grand Central Hotel,"I could not recommend the Grand Central highly enough! The staff at the Grand Central were fantastic. Great attitude. Helpful, and always available. A true sample of excellent hospitality! The front desk staff were extremely professional. I dealt with Maeve and Matthew, and they were so pleasant, and easy to get along with.   I stayed in the Alfred Suite and it was so luxurious, spotless and every attention to detail accounted for. The Food in the Grand Café was exceptional, and the service was outstanding. The Observatory bar was extravagant and classy, which I loved! The pianist which played was so talented and lovely to listen to.   The best part about my stay was the breakfast – 10/10, could not recommend it highly enough!   Exceptional service, which made my stay truly…"
943,Grand Central Hotel,Stayed here on Saturday 6th May with another couple of friends. From the minute we arrived the staff at reception made us very welcome. The entire stay from the very nice and friendly staff to a beautiful room and breakfast was exceptional. A visit to floor 23 is a must for the views and the cocktails.
944,Grand Central Hotel,"I had a fantastic stay at the grand central Belfast, I am a disabled guest and the quality of the service I received was 2nd to none. I wish to pay particular attention to the two door men who were absolute gentlemen and obviously good friends, Ian Jameson and John Dodd. Overall, all the staff were magnificent, superbly trained, and very efficient. The rooms were beautiful, quality of food was fantastic, and the overall ambience was perfect. I required a room with accessibility needs, and was given the most beautiful room on the 22nd floor. The view was breathtaking and the room was amazing. I would greatly encourage anyone to attend this hotel, although this was my first visit, it, most certainly will not be my last. Regards, Steve Wilson."
945,Grand Central Hotel,Not 5 stars standards. Average room. Bed poorly made No mini-bar / fridge. Curtains won’t black out the room. Very disappointing breakfast nowhere near the 5 stars standards. Friendly staff but short of everything. Disappointing service.
946,Grand Central Hotel,"Staff in general were not the friendliest, the Observatory bar closed to guests at 11.30, and tables were being set around us, very noisily to encourage us to leave. The logos then were turned up so full to signal again it was time to leave that we had to ask for them to be turned down. Cooked breakfast was quite cold. All in all, not what would be expected from a hotel of this calibre"
947,Grand Central Hotel,"I would imagine that not many people would take an over night stay in a hotel only 3 1/2 miles from where they live but we made an except for a birthday night out with a meal and overnight followed by breakfast in the Grand Central Belfast. It did not disappoint at all. Even though its only opened 5 or 6 years, it was full of interesting facts and items from the famous old hotel it took its name from in Belfast that opened during Victorian times, as well as lots of reminders of the history of Belfast too. We cannot thank John Mac enough for making our stay extra special and looking after everything that we needed or could want. All the staff were so pleasant and helpful too. As for the view from the room and the observatory on the top floor, it was incredible! If you are…"
948,Grand Central Hotel,"First time on the 23rd floor for a coffee but I think it might be the last time as well... Fantastic view from the top floor and very comfortable seatings. The concierge at the door was very helpful and delightful to chat to, all the staff we met were super friendly and attentive... But why I'm only rating 3 stars?? ... oh gosh..your coffees were awful... For a 5 stars hotel, we were expecting to pay more , but if I'm paying £5.20 for a Americano I am expecting quality also, it was like a cup of lukewarm brown dirty water. I heard that yous have your own special blend of beans.. What a waste.. I'm sorry for being a coffee snob but if you can't do the simple things right than you lose me"
949,Grand Central Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay here The staff were very welcoming and good at their job The rooms were very comfortable and exceptionally clean The view from the higher floors is fab Breakfast was very good and we ate in the Cafe one of the nights as well and it was equally as good And of course, we sampled a cocktail in the wonderful observatory I would certainly recommend this hotel and it is a great location to see this great cities attractions and its friendly locals"
950,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"We stayed at this hotel from Friday - Monday for Magic Weekend at the stadium. What a fantastic find! From the get go, the hotel is warm and welcoming and so clean and tidy in the reception/bar area. Victoria on reception welcomed us and she was so friendly and really set the precedent for the rest of the weekend. The rooms were very clean and the perfect size for what we needed. We had one maintenance issue which we reported to reception, and by the time we’d gone out for a few hours, it had already been fixed! The location is great and if I ever come back to Newcastle, I definitely be staying here."
951,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Nice modern hotel located central for shops and nearby railway station. The hotel and our room was clean and fresh with a contemporary decor. We booked a room that had a double and single bed as they were shown as being larger than a standard double room, however the room was not really that big, it also felt quite claustrophobic as the window was of a letterbox configuration. We included breakfast which was buffet style and adequate."
952,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"I brought my son to Newcastle for a birthday treat and chose Maldron as it looked nice and the rate included breakfast. Kids love staying in hotels anyway but when Victoria at Reception realised it was his birthday she organised drinks vouchers (included soft drinks for my boy as he’s only 10!), chocolates and a card which he was so pleased with and it made him feel extra special. The room was really comfortable and we both had a good sleep after a busy day. Breakfast had plenty of options and good coffee. My only regret is that I didn’t realise there were robots delivering room service until we checked out, that would have blown my sons mind 😂 I will definitely stay here again!"
953,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Lovely hotel. Clean everywhere we went. Rooms (deluxe double) nice and good size. Breakfast was lovely too..buffet type and all good quality and quickly topped up. Would've been 5 stars but we had a bit of a wait to get our keys due to people turning up to get bags and only one receptionist, But was very pleasant and we were able to get in our room early. Would definitely go again."
954,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,Central location all you could need for an overnight stay. This says it all really. stayed 1 night due to work. Easy check in. Comfy clean room and great bathroom with walk-in shower. Breakfast buffet style and all you could possibly want both hot and cold. Overall great hotel in a super location if you are visiting central Newcastle. Would return and recommend.
955,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Spent the weekend at this hotel and was happy overall. Newcastle is wild with hen and stag do's and this was reflected in the hotel guests. We were there for a hen-do and felt very comfortable in this space, without any of the madness that can happen! A particular mention for Scotty in the restaurant who provided top tier service and hilarious chat."
956,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Really comfortable and very well equipped rooms and a great location for the city centre and station, not quite so good for parking. Breakfasts were great and staff every welcoming, especially Arif on reception"
957,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Nice hotel, well located close to the football stadium, the train station and lots of restaurants. The room was clean. Friendly staff and thank you especially to Arif at reception for his very nice welcome."
958,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"The hotel is slap bang in the centre of Newcastle, rooms are a decent size, clean airy and comfortable. Victoria along with the male staff member in the reception was polite, warm, helpful and able to deal with some demanding customers in a professional manner, you are a credit to your company, thank you. At one point during our stay I asked a member of the housekeeping team who was cleaner our room for extra milk and coffee and after having a look on her cart advised she didn't have any but would be more than happy to go and get some for us. I didn't get her name (she had pink tips in her hair), thank you. I think we will choose the Maldron next time we are in Newcastle."
959,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"enthusiastic staff, I arrived earlier than planned because of an unexpected business, but Arif - one of the staff enthusiastically helped me. nice clean room, right in the center and shopping area :)) everything is perfect, I will definitely come back 🥰"
960,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Lovely clean and fresh hotel. Right in the heart of the city with great transport links. Rooms are lovely and quiet and noise free. The staff are all extremely friendly, especially young Arif on reception - check in was swift, efficient and friendly. Thank you!"
961,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Stayed for 11 nights whilst visiting family in Freeman's Hospital. Originally booked for one night but had to keep extending my stay due to complications with surgery. The staff were amazing at reception and ensured I kept the same room to make things easier for me. Hotel is spotless and rooms are very comfortable. The service is excellent from all departments. Restaurant staff , Bar staff, and the lovely gentleman who checks people in for breakfast. Thank you."
962,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"This is my second stay in Maldron hotel.I highly recommend this hotel not only for its location, cleanliness, and service but for the amazing staff that they have brought client service to another level. Special thanks for Anna and the whole team especially Suzan, Victoria, Arif, Alex, Jodie, Sonia, Scott, and Jemi for making each stay unforgettable. Definitely coming back the next time I visit the city."
963,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Good hotel in every respect. Located in centre between the station and the RVI hospital which I was visiting. Both only 5-10 minutes walk from the hotel. Impressive sound insulation! Despite being in the middle of Newcastle on a Saturday night, the room was quiet. I was very warmly and sympathetically greeted and checked in by Victoria, who deserves a special mention. A lovely person!"
964,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Great hotel! City centre location, modern rooms, comfy bed and great shower. Arif was brilliant at reception - always helpful and happy, a lovely welcome to the hotel! Highly recommend to anyone wishing to stay in Newcastle."
965,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Great city centre hotel, offering a great breakfast. Not far to walk to the Eldon Square shopping centre, library, museums, and restaurants. A modern hotel with roomy, comfortable beds, large bathroom and very quiet."
966,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"This hotel isn’t suited for business travellers. There was no desk in my room to sit comfortably at my laptop. The restaurant chairs are lounge style so better for drinking than eating a meal. The menu is snacky, the breakfast sausages were undercooked, the coffee is from a cheap machine, the hair dryer was missing an attachment, when I moved a bed for a video call there were bits of litter and dust underneath. The tips don’t go to the staff. If all this reads as though I’m being picky then this hote will be fine for you because it is better than a budget hotel. But if you a travelling on business I would spens a little more if you can."
967,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Rooms are a good size and comfortable. Lovely walk in shower and hot water. You can hear next door though and doors slamming on the corridor. Bed was comfortable but pillows not great. They do provide shower gel which was incredibly drying, but there are no luxuries such as body lotion - which is a shame and would make a real difference. Limited milk and coffee too, and what no biscuits? The sink was incredibly slow draining - so clearly needs attention from house keeping/maintenance. The bathroom smelled of cigarette smoke. Breakfast was very good, possibly one of the best I've had for a walk up buffet. Good quality ingredients and nicely presented and decent temperature. Would of been nice to have been told that there was porridge available. I was pointed in the direction…"
968,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Excellent hotel - room was spacious and clean, lovely bar downstairs available for coffee and drinks, and breakfast was delicious. Victoria on the front desk helped us with storing our luggage post checkout and was friendly and professional. Highly recommended a stay at the Maldron"
969,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Love staying here, fabulous central location 5 mins walk to the train station and a great city. Fantastic value for money too. Special mention for Arif on the front desk who was so helpful and appreciative of us as returning guests."

976,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Superb. New, modern, well designed, quiet room and great value. Perfect for a stay for business/shopping/uni visit. Good breakfast offering. Organised, spacious, plenty on offer. Shout out to the fabulous Scott who greeted us, showed a real interest in our visit and choosing us a table that suited where we would like to sit. He is a real asset. Jodie on reception also very helpful when I had left my washbag in room. Would stay here again and recommend."
977,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,Excellent staff service from Clinton in the dining room despite being staff short-handed he served all diners and even served at the bar poor lad was virtually running until more staff turned up. Despite the busy time he was cheerful and had time for all customers.
978,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Stayed here for one night and the rooms are very nice, hotel very modern, staff friendly. A long wait for the bar as only 2 members of staff on and lots of groups of stags and hens. Clean hotel, comfy beds. Get discounted parking at Q park 5 mins away. Good location near by to everything.

981,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"What a fab 2 night stay at the Maldron Hotel. Perfect location - everything is a couple of minute walk away from the hotel which is ideal. The reception staff were so pleasant and check in was so easy - we arrived a little bit earlier than the 3pm check in and the room was ready. A wee shout out to Alex who was so polite and charming when we checked out. Great selection at breakfast aswell and it was all you can eat:) we paid for this as we didn't pay for it when we booked. A wee shout out to the elderly man who was working during breakfast (didn't see his name afar). It was so lovely to see his interactions with so many of the guests, he had a big smile on his face as he spoke to the guests and you could tell he loved his job🥰 it made me smile. The lights stopped working…"
982,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Great stay. Speedy and very friendly check in with Arif, who also upgraded our room. Spacious, clean room and bathroom. Great comfy beds, great night sleep. Excellent hot breakfast, with very friendly staff. Will definitely stay again - 😁"

984,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Arif is by far one of the best hotel staff members I've ever come across. Extremely helpful, polite and accommodating. 5th floor is a bit noisy due to a lot of kids staying currently (but nothing to do with the staff and overall stay)"
985,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"The best hotel that you can stay at in Newcastle city centre. The hotel is clean and the staff are exceptional. If you are lucky enough to be assisted by Arif then you can be sure you will get the best service. Arif upgraded our room at no extra cost. Brilliant service, I cannot recommend this hotel enough."
986,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Stayed here several times and won’t use any other Newcastle hotel now. It is immaculate in every way. It’s my home away from home. All the staff are fantastic but Arif especially who checked me in again made me feel like I’d arrived back home and couldn’t have been any more pleasant and accommodating. He is definitely an asset to the Maldron. I care full time for my mum who suffers with Dementia so these breaks at the Maldron Hotel mean the world to us both. It’s a wonderful escape from being at home all the time. It’s always comfortable, exceptionally clean, well appointed and within easy reach of shops, transport hubs and numerous restaurants and bars."
987,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"I'm a regular business visitor to the hotel with my colleagues and Arif is very helpful during check in, sorting out my preferred room and all round great customer service. We always choose to stay here when in Newcastle"
988,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Arif greeted me with a big smile in my hometown language, and I felt so welcomed to the hotel and Newcastle- much appreciated. He even upgraded my room. The room is as good as I expected from a 4-star, clean, mordern and has everything I need. Will stay again for my next trip!"
989,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"We had a lovely experience at this hotel, a nice room, great breakfast and a superb location in the centre of the town but best of all was the friendly greeting we had from Arif he was so welcoming anď made us feel totally at ease from the very start. Arif is a credit to your hotel and is to be applauded for his attitude, we would certainly recommend Maldron to our friends and family."
990,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip. Great hotel. 5 mins from railway station. Friendly and efficient staff. Comfortable rooms with all required amenities. Central area so plenty of food/shopping/going out options as well. Smart and modern. No hesitation to re book.
991,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Modernes, einfaches, komfortables Hotel im Stadtzentrum von Newcastle. Durchschnittspreise. Zu empfehlen für kurze Geschäfts- oder Erholungsreisen. Breakfast ist ok, as it is the location, for you are quiet in the town center. To be recommended, though"
992,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"I enjoyed my stay here ,wonderful and friendly hotel.Big thankyou to all the staff so kind and friendly and made feel welcome. Special thanks to Arif from the reception . I’m looking forward to stay there again ."

995,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Our 1st time staying at this hotel and we couldn't fault it, staff were excellent especially Arif lovely gentleman; 100% We only stayed 1 night for a concert but will definitely be staying longer the next time"
996,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"I arrived at the hotel on a Friday afternoon shortly before the check-in time of 3pm and was initially downhearted to see a large group on a hen party checking in before me - I contemplated having to buy some earplugs to get any sleep that night. The manager, seeing my reaction, came up to me to have a quiet word, assuring me that such parties are kept segregated on a separate floor and I would be given a quite room. The excellent Arif who handled my check in ensured that this was the case. I was given a very comforable room on the 5th floor and had a wonderful night's sleep. All of the staff were attentive and extremely friendly. The bar was a comfortable place to eat and the breakast buffet the following morning was outstanding. The trip was great value for money and I…"
997,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Really enjoyed our stay here ,really nice hotel.Big thankyou to all the staff so kind and friendly and made feel welcome.top customer service from Arif.will definitely stay there again if we visit again."
998,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Had afternoon tea , booked as Christmas present. Food great staff came over multiple times to see f we needed or wanted anything . Definitely recommend. Waitress excellent called Rebecca d . Sandwich’s, cakes . The usual with 2 mimosas in with it. Great day. Thank you"
999,Maldron Hotel Newcastle,"Booked dinner bed and breakfast but was very disappointed with the set menu choice. Felt like a second class citizen being giving a different menu to other people in the restaurant - I would have preferred to choose just one course from the normal one. Also I had a problem with the chrome cast on the tv which I reported to Reception and they said someone would come and sort it - No-one came. Also thick dust on the base of the phone in the room, I don’t think it can of been cleaned for months!"
1000,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","This hotel was awesome and the area is perfect--Seven Dial circle with Covent Garden just a short walk away. Restaurant of every kind and shopping too.. I have mobility issues and rented a scooter to use during my trip to London. It arrived and was the largest scooter I've ever seen! It would't fit into the elevator!! So the staff would put it in their office every night and charge it for me. I think it took up 1/3 of their office space! They were so nice and always helpful. The room was spacious (tower room with a fabulous view and a shower which I needed). Set reservation up to include breakfast and my-oh-my-it was delicious! Room was so clean with one the most comfortable mattresses ever. But by far, the biggest plus for this hotel is the staff. I would and plan…"
1001,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",Great hotel located right next to the tube. The rooms were good with adequate space and furnishing. For us the most liked aspect was the breakfast. The spread is good and everything coming out of that kitchen was delicious. Will stay here again.
1002,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","excellent located city hotel, many possibilities by walking, very good accommodation , perfect breakfast buffet for a great start in the day! very friendly staff. the rooms for a family with three people was good, not much left space left with the sofa changed in a third bed."
1003,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Great service accommodations and helpful friendly staff. Ed our concierge was very professional, friendly and attentive. We sure would come back to stay at your hotel. They gave us all the assistance we needed, accommodating my husbands needs with his medications . Thank you!"
1004,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Our stay at the Edwardian Blu on Mercer Street was fantastic. The location on the Seven Dials was perfect. There were many shops and cafes, the Seven Dials Market was wonderful. The nights were quiet very few honks of horns annd few emegency vehicle sirens. Juan at the Bar was fantastic and Ed the concierge was extremely helpful! We plan to go back."
1005,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","so much value for money and such nice staff. right in the centre of theaters we were able to walk to see our show and ate in the hotel, which was superb.. they even brought us a cocktail on the house."
1006,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","We found ourselves at the rear of the hotel when booked through Booking.com. We paid £390 for 1 nights stay.. Overlooked by lots of windows (2nd floor). No voile, so for privacy we closed the blind. The lights were only working on one side of the room so it was semi darkness. The bathroom was the smallest we've experienced in any hotel. Everything was very clean in the room but sparse and it felt very depressing due to this and the outlook of the room. Have prices gone up so much in London that this is what you get for nearly £400 !!??"
1007,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","This was one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in. The Hero of the hotel is the staff! Particularly I would mention the two Concierges that we met Ed and George. They were both capable, friendly, and made us feel very much at home. The information they g1ve us was right on the spot. Thankyou for that. Krishna working in the dining room was very helpful and friendly, We also met the lovely cleaning lady from the Gambia whose name we didn’t catch, but she was friendly and our room was always spotless. I mention theses because they made a particular impression on us, however every member of staff was friendly, and pleasant. We found the room comfortable, and the accessories supplied were useful. The bathroom was very small, and the only downside of the experience, but it…"
1008,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Our stay was 5* it was amazing. I highly recommend this hotel when you are staying at London. The location was perfect it was near a tube station and we did almost everything by foot. The service at the Hotel was wowwww!!!! The breakfast was delicious, the personal at the reception were so kind aswell in the Restaurant."
1009,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Excellent location close to shopping, restaurants, theaters and more. Walking distance to everything. In the heart of everything yet que quiet. Comfortable rooms, attentive staff and great breakfast. Perfect stay in London— will be back."
1010,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",The room is a bit old but is big enough and very clean . The location can't get better its perfect Some staff members were lovely so me not so much Worth the price mostly becouse of the location Is central but quiet
1011,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Very happy with this hotel! Quiet despite a very central location, clean and comfortable rooms. The staff was also very friendly. I will come back again and next time I may try the restaurant of the hotel or the room service."
1012,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","It was our first stay in this hotel and we loved it. It is right on the Seven dials, a very lively district full of restaurants, pubs and shops. the closest metro station is Leicester square . The hotel itself is situated in an old building. I was staying in a standard room - it is ok for one person but very small for two people . The bed was queen size. Yet the room was functional , had everything you need . We had breakfast in the hotel and it was very nice - everything was fresh and tasty. The waiting staff was exceptional. I also want to commend the front office - all the guys and girls were very warm and welcoming . Everyone genuinely cared about the guests. All our requests were fulfilled quickly. This hotel has become our favorite in London . Will definitely…"
1013,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Very good hotel, staff were friendly and helpful. The location was perfect as we had booked to see a show at the prince Edward theatre and it was less than 10 minute walk away. The food at the Monmouth was very nice and so were the cocktails. Would definitely stay here again"
1014,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","A great unexpected experience starting with very friendly and helpful staff, followed with a well appointed room with excellent comfortable bedding and completed by a fantastic breakfast with truffled poached eggs, a killing pain perdu and really good cappuccino served by smilling and friendly staffed!"
1015,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","We had high expectations and these were met! Visited coronation weekend and if the hotel was busy, it didnt show. The service was excellent from the moment we arrived. Best hotel breakfast. Excellent service in the restaurant also. Thank you. Excellent location, outside the business of the city but walking distance to Covent Garden."
1016,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",This was my fourth nine-day stay in the last two years . . . which says something in itself. Great location in fascinating Soho and only a few minutes walk from Covent Garden and also the tube. Very clean and well appointed rooms. Pleasant and knowledgeable staff. Great breakfast selection.
1017,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",Amazing location right in the heart of everything. Walkable to all of London. Super friendly and helpful staff. They were able to answer all of our questions and made excellent recommendations. The corner suite was very roomy for three of us.
1018,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Just double check that everything offered and that you pay for is delivered on. Some services are offered and then when you follow up on them aren't delivered. Okay room, nice overall aesthetic at the hotel, has a good finish. Was a little disappointed as well on checkout to see people being offered drinks on arrival the next day when I was offered nothing on arrival. Check out process promised a lot of things that didn't happen unfortunately. It's positioned well but for the experience and price I won't be returning or recommending."
1019,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Perfect location, good rooms, nice, but overprices breakfast. Unfriendly and not customer oriented staff at reception. I would not recommend to spend so much money only for location of the hotel... Everything else need to live up to the standard as well."
1020,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","I would have given a 4 star rating, but unfortunately we endured the worst check in we have suffered in 40 years of travelling. On arrival we were greeted by a disinterested person behind the desk. On giving our name he then spent at least 5 minutes muttering down the phone, totally ignoring us standing there. Clearly there was an issue. Eventually he emerged from behind his computer and told us the room was not ready and we would have to wait. Now bear in mind that we were checking in at 18.00 pm for a 15.00 check in. We were on a schedule and this was extremely inconvenient. At this stage if the check in person had shown some empathy and attempted to retrieve the situation, we would have been placated, but all we got was' I cant do anything' A sincere apology and…"
1021,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",Everything was excellent! The services were of high quality. Availability for tourist orientation. Very good food. The cleaning services were performed according to the client's availability. Mr. Edward Parkes fits the job perfectly.
1022,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Wonderful hotel in a great location. Staff really attentive and friendly. Couldn’t do enough to help with local advice, organising taxis and asking how our stay was. Breakfast was excellent and the bar really nice."
1023,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",The hotel is in a great location. The staff are really friendly and nothing was a bother to them. Ed on the front desk was particularly friendly and helpful. We were also given two vouchers for a free cocktail. A great experience all in all.we will be back again.
1024,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Three things stand out with regard to our 5 day stay here in mid-March. First of all, we purposely chose a Radisson Blu and this location (Covent Garden). Both the staff and the location were excellent! With the help of the staff we saw 3 plays and made arrangements for several tours and outings plus pubs and restaurants, most within easy walking distance. There was a slight billing hick-up with the restaurant but it was resolved immediately."
1025,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Radisson Blu Mercer Street was a great experience. The service in the reception was immediately a positive surprise. We also had a very nice room on the 7th floor with practically a 320 view mainly towards the London Eye +++. Very comfortable bed, spacious room, cool interior and a delicate bathroom. Nothing missing. We ate in the Monmouth restaurant, highly recommendable where we also had delicious breakfast in the morning. Very friendly service all over and the Concierge Ed, just fixed things for us with a smile and interest. Impressive! The hotel was perfectly placed for our London program and the ""buzz"" in the streets around is great. Radisson Blu Mercer Street is highly recommendable."
1026,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","This hotel is absolutely stunning & in a fab location near Covent Garden. Ed Parkes Head Concierge was outstanding from the minute we walked in the door. Friendly, smiley & customer focused at all times. Helped with luggage & taxi on departure. Rooms are very well equipped with everything. Breakfast was great too- great choice of food & great service. Will definitely return to this wonderful Hotel"
1027,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",This hotel seems to be without peer in the Seven Dials area. It is immaculately clean and the well-trained staff give it the feel of a fine London home. We chose a room with a king bed and it was superbly comfortable. The breakfast served is ample and includes a variety of hot and cold dishes. Reception staff was off the charts in their knowledge of hospitality and guest services. Definitely worth the money in a most central location.
1028,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",Excellent location and service. Comfortable and quiet rooms. Staff were very welcoming and helpful. The area has great independent shops and the hotel is perfectly placed for theatre land and Covent Garden
1029,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Wonderful hotel in a great location! The rooms are small, but nicely appointed with comfortable beds. Everyone at the front desk was polite and helpful. There are many choices nearby for breakfast, but the hotel breakfast was excellent with a lot of food options if you choose to pay the extra money. I definitely recommend this hotel."
1030,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Great stay, room clean and comfortable, shout out to the bar staff (22nd March) nothing was too much trouble, the team truly delivered a great customer experience, thank you! Will certainly book again …………………………………………………………………….. …….."
1031,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Upon arrival, we were given a friendly welcome, including complimentary Prosecco. During our stay all staff were very friendly and efficient. Special mention to those waiting at breakfast, who were very attentive, ensuring we had refills of hot drinks and that we had all we wanted to eat. Location is very good, a short walk to Covent Garden where we went to the ROH on our first night. Housekeeping was very good e.g. rooms were immaculately clean, fresh towels and crockery were provided each day. Only odd thing was two steps up to the door of our room and then immediately two steps down on the other side! Just something to be wary of as this may be unsuitable for some."
1032,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Great location with a highly motivated and accomplished staff. No request was too big or too small. The housekeeping staff was friendly and very easy to deal with on a daily basis. The hotel has a very nice cozy yet modern feel to it and the location is terrific with respect to the West End, shopping, dining, and public transportation."
1033,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Wonderful welcome, attentive staff, clean and comfortable room and very conveniantly located in the heart of Covent Garden close to theatres and sights. Can very much reccomend and will certainly be returning."
1034,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","We enjoyed a superbly located boutique hotel, near Covent Garden, with a very good service and welcoming staff, all needed for a enjoyable and lovely long weekend in London. Looking forward for next vacation there"
1035,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Friendly, helpful staff, conveniently located for theatre, Chinatown, Covent Garden and other major tourist attractions. Clean, simply decorated room, soft pillows, good breakfast choices .. what’s not to like?"
1036,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","We have just stayed for one night at this Hotel. This is our third stay over a period of 6 years and it just gets better and better! The location is perfect for us as we usually do a show, this time it was Tina and it was wonderful would definitely recommend. All the staff go above and beyond to take care of you, always a very warm welcome and professional service when we stay. We were very lucky to be upgraded to a corner suite on this visit, it was fabulous! And I highly recommend! I felt thoroughly spoilt, it has everything you could wish for including a dressing room with a professional lightbulb mirror and Dyson hairdryer, enough sockets for straighteners curlers etc. Robes, slippers, tea making facilities, coffee machine and a large fridge. The bed and pillows were the…"
1037,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","This was our second stay at Mercer Street, and every bit as delightful as our first visit. We were warmly greeted by Ed, who went the extra mile to ensure our stay was everything we asked for. Our room was small but perfectly formed, with a comfortable bed,a well appointed bathroom, and was well equipped. Light bites in the bar area were just right for a pre or post Theatre visit. Again, served by helpful and friendly staff. All these details add up to a very positive experience at Mercer Street, and I hope we will return before too long."
1038,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Our 4th visit in 5 years and we will be back again. The minute we walked through the door the welcome was fantastic and this was the same with every person we encountered. Fantastic situation for seeing shows, restaurants and shows and great link to Heathrow on Piccadilly underground line. In fact there are a number of stations nearby giving a range of tube lines to get around London. Not the cheapest hotel in town but we cant stop returning."
1039,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","The Radisson is situated perfectly for those who enjoy lots of activity though can have a peaceful nights sleep. In the seven dials and walking to so many different activities or closest to two different tube stations, including Heathrow. The room is small and well appointed. We were here for five days and were able to fit our luggage but still have room to move around. For longer then this and you’re two adults there just isn’t enough storage space. I’d recommend the hotel add hooks or shelves under the TV to accommodate other storage needs. The bed was very comfortable and the room temp also good. A window opens so if you need fresh air you can. Shower was excellent. All in all just a nice stay and very, very convenient. Ravi did a great job checking us out 😊."
1040,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Check-in was easy and smooth. We arrived a little early but a little wait and we got the room. We were celebrating our special occasion at the hotel, and our bed was nicely decorated with petals upon arrival-a sweet gesture. We had an upgraded room which was a little bit bigger than some-I would hate to see the smallest rooms then! I see that that’s what people mentions often-room size! I cannot complain as our room was decent size. Windows could be opened and we had a bath tub. Room was freshly updated. Location is SUPERB. Breakfast was ok. The lady taking care of us forgot half of the things and didn’t appear very friendly. Food was standard, not impressive. Better to grab a bite somewhere else if you can. The hotel is a boutique hotel so it’s cosy and almost feels like…"
1041,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",Excellent service at front desk and in restaurant. Breakfast was very good with table served warm dishes and special coffees. Only minus is that basic (superior) rooms were quite small and the double bed was bit narrow. Location was perfect between Soho and Covent Garden.
1042,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","We really did enjoy our stay. For theatre-goers like us the location was perfect and our room was quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious - and something really special with its Italian and Peruvian choices. People, the staff, were extremely friendly and helpful. Hope we can come back some day!"
1043,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","This is by far my favourite London hotel. The location is perfect, opposite the Cambridge theatre (currently showing Matilda - which is brilliant and I thoroughly recommend) 5 minutes from Covent Garden/Leicester Square etc. As someone who travels on their own for business, I always feel safe here. The rooms are quiet and comfortable, and I sleep very well. Breakfast is a good selection of freshly made hot food and cold buffet. On my last trip I actually visited the bar for the first time and can add that they have an excellent selection of spirits. However, what really makes it stand out from other hotels are the staff. They are simply excellent, always friendly and helpful. As a return guest, the fact that they remember me means a lot, and I really appreciate it. I’d…"
1044,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London",Had a fab visit to Radisson Mercer Street Hotel in fantastic location walking distance to all the attractions. Staff all lovely especially Concierge Ed who made our trip most memorable with his friendly chat and great advice…top lad! Will definitely be back soon.
1045,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","Fantastic location on the edge of the entertainment district of London, great service with attentive staff, beautifully reconstructed modern rooms, but it is poor value for money you are better off with a local Airbnb or just a few streets further out"
1046,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","The staff at the Radisson Blu mercer street were wonderful. I’d phoned when making the booking to request a room with a walk in shower due to mobility issues. When we arrived Ed was at the door to greet and book us in. They’d made sure to allocate us a room with plenty of space and a walk in shower. The hotel is in a great location for theatres and restaurants to explore, but Ed was also on hand with some great recommendations when needed. Overall great hotel that provides a personal experience."
1047,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","We visited as a family of 3, and booked a corner suite. The reception staff, the room and the helpful attitude of ALL the staff in the hotel has been quite unbelievable. My husband and I are visiting again this weekend ! We are regular ‘London’ visitors and have a favourite hotel, however we had decided to make a change and see what we thought. It was a huge gamble for us…. and it has paid off. Sometimes things work and sometimes they don’t , this did . They have worked hard to cope with disability , diet and awkward requests from us. We thank you. It has made travel a pleasure and something to look forward to."
1048,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","For the princely sum of £375 a night my spouse and I got a moderately sized room, which included breakfast. 2x we tried to order room service for breakfast, dutifully filling out the card. 2x it appeared late. (Strike 1). The first morning when breakfast was late, I was told the card was “filled out incorrectly” with the wrong room number. I asked to see the card - it was filled out correctly. (Strike 2 - instinctively blaming the guest for their mistake). After speaking to the restaurant Manager on morning 1, I was told breakfast would be no charge. I told him it’s pre-paid so he can’t give me something for free that I’ve already paid for. When the breakfast did arrive, an hour late, half was missing, and the delivery person told me he needed to charge me. I flat out refused. …"
1049,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel, London","The location was great. Close to Entertainment venues. Lots of good restaurants near by. Close to all the shops. Ed, the concierge was excellent with great recommendations for restaurants- which he then booked for us."
1050,The Stratford Hotel,"I wanted to do something a little special for my wife's birthday, so booked this hotel in London as our base. We had a fantastic time there. Lovely room and great, friendly staff...highly recommended."
1051,The Stratford Hotel,"Great people ( special shout-out to DJ), great food and ambience and a hotel where nothing is too much trouble. Would thoroughly recommend. The only thing that could improve the experience would be a make-up / shaving mirror in the bathroom."
1052,The Stratford Hotel,"I stayed at the Stratford Hotel for 4 nights in May 2023. My daughters had a swimming competition at the Olympic Pool, and I was looking for somewhere within walking distance. I think The Stratford is the best in the area. It was a 5-minute walk from the pool and next to Westfields Mall, which was fab. it was also right next to the train and underground stations. To Oxford Street, it was about 5 stops and took 15 minutes. The hotel itself is lovely. The rooms were small but nice. Would absolutely stay here again, especially if I am going to the pool again."
1053,The Stratford Hotel,"Absolutely loved our stay. It was to celebrate my husband’s 60th, and asked for the Birthday package, which included balloons and small cakes beautifully presented. The room was very comfortable and spacious. The breakfast was excellent as was their evening menu. The Stratford is a great location, with easy access to the tubes. Staff couldn’t do enough for you. Would definitely recommend and book again."
1054,The Stratford Hotel,"We (3 ladies who celebrated 50th birthdays during Covid) stayed at the Stratford International Way London. We were going to the Abba Voyage experience and this hotel seemed close by and was a great price. From start to finish, the hotel was exceptional. The staff from waiting staff to reception were so friendly and personable, a special mention must go to Simona! The hotel had something going on all the time, the rooms were exceptionally clean and no noise could be heard from outside or along the corridor. The breakfast was really fresh, even down to warm crusty bread. Directly outside the hotel was the Westfield Shopping Centre, the largest shopping centre in Europe and one of the exits led onto a street filled with restaurants and bars, It was a 10 min walk to the Abba…"
1055,The Stratford Hotel,"Nice and new hotel, with friendly staff. Our large room was very nice and we asked for a twin bed setup which was arranged as promised. Unfortunally just one pair of bath slippers available (out of stock). Which is fine but please communicate about this so I can bring my own. Now had to go out and buy them after a long day in London. Minibar was quite warm. Bathroom is very nice but I would of liked a magnifying mirror. The water pressure on the 6th floor is very bad. The breakfast is good, but standard. I was not really impressed but it was of good quality. One morning we were in a hurry, but we got some take away boxes for take away breakfast. Roomservice is only available if the restaurant is open (so do not expect breakfast or night service). What we really liked was the…"
1056,The Stratford Hotel,"Nice hotel, good location, excellent for O2 and other local amenities. Beds and bedding were fantastic. Lovely shower. Only had breakfast one day and would say that whilst nice, it was a tad pricey. Would stay again if visiting East London."
1057,The Stratford Hotel,"Relaxed but effective service always with a smile. Very comfortable rooms and bed, nice bathroom. Breakfast is very good, whether cold or hot buffet option is taken. Lounge bar and table service staff also do a great job"
1058,The Stratford Hotel,"The hotel is perfectly located, close to Westfield and just opposite Stratford International so access into central London is really easy. We were greeted very warmly by reception who made our room available a little bit earlier than the 3 pm check in. The hotel is walking distance from the East Village so there are lots of restaurants and bars on. you're doorstep away from traffic. Our room was modern and comfortable with everything we needed. Breakfast was very busy and the restaurant itself is relatively small. There is plenty of space in the lobby area of the hotel though. The bar in the main lobby was busy, we returned after an evening out and were hoping to sit in the lobby area. After waiting for a good ten minutes, the bar man told us rather abruptly that he was too…"
1059,The Stratford Hotel,"Bar man with white shirt was only interested in serving female's(just the 3 he was interested in and no-one else). It was 28th of April, his other colleagues seemed to be more professional than him. It's so frustrating when you are paying the same amount of money"
1060,The Stratford Hotel,"The Stratford hotel put simply is a ""showstopper"" property. The Stratford hotel is conveniently located a stones throw from Olympic Park and Westfield Shopping centre, and now the Elizabeth Line, makes the journey time from central London under 8 minutes - its a must stay for business or pleasure! The hotel has 145 bedrooms, and 4 event spaces as well as a amazing restaurants and bars, all with a luxury and contemporary vibe, including house DJ. The Allegro restaurant on the 7th floor with outstanding floor to ceiling views of the capital. The Chefs selection menu, was first class - mouthwatering and aesthetically displayed, with a exemplary service to match! Rooms tick every box, and entry level rooms come with full mini bar and unique Stratford hoodies as standard. If you…"
1061,The Stratford Hotel,"There are so many positives to staying at the Stratford Hotel and the first was being able to park next door to the hotel, it was not expensive and was easy to find. Next was the welcome, warm and enthusiastic and being given an upgrade was really kind. The Manhatton Studio was large, clean and contained one of the biggest baths ever! The bed was really comfortable with squishy but firm pillows and the tv was fully up to date so we could download programmes from our phone. Plus there were hoody's to wear in the room. One of our most comfortable stays and dinner and breakfast were perfect for the very reasonable price. We can't wait to return!"
1062,The Stratford Hotel,"Having lived at the hotel during each week for the past 5 weeks I have seen all there is to see. Professional, friendly and though not cheap certainly value for money. Staff endeavour to make your stay warm and friendly by remembering your name and knowing your favourite table for breakfast."
1063,The Stratford Hotel,Ideal situation near the train station and only 7' from the city center thanks to the southeastern railways. Good restaurant and very nice and modern rooms. The breakfast offers a large choice with options for everyone.
1064,The Stratford Hotel,"Good hotel. Clean and modern and a very real alternative to the big name hotels located in the same area. Food good. Hotel clean. Staff friendly and attentive. Bed and bedding excellent quality. Check in process very slick. One minor issue - the water pressure on the sixth floor is nowhere near high enough to service the large shower pan - the best I could manage was a trickle, but the smaller shower head works perfectly."
1065,The Stratford Hotel,"Great Stay. Very comfortable bed and pillows, good breakfast and lovely hot coffee. Staff attentive and overall very happy. Treated to a complimentary upgrade which was a lovely surprise. We stay here regularly for business and always enjoy our stay. Very central location with easy access to the Central Line."
1066,The Stratford Hotel,"Great location right by Stratford International Station. Easy to drive to from the M11 and multi-storey parking next door. Stayed one night when we went to the ABBA Voyage concert, easy walk ( DLR wasn't running) to Pudding Mill Lane. Nice room on the 4th floor with a view to the south overlooking the train station. Slight noise from the trains but not intrusive. Easy check in and out, they don't tell you they take £50 deposit which is quickly refunded on check out to cover extras. Great price when booking direct. Good buffet breakfast with plenty of choice."
1067,The Stratford Hotel,"Were a family of four and we really had a great time staying in! Staff are all friendly and love, room is very clean, our breakfast are superb. A very spacious Hotel. Always coming back at Stratford Hotel everytime were in London. 😊"
1068,The Stratford Hotel,"This is now my favourite place to stay in London. The location is great, shopping at Westfield, handy for the O2, or across the road from the DLR, hop on the Jubilee line and straight into the heart of the city. This is the quietest hotel I’ve stayed at in London. Always a great nights sleep. So much choice at breakfast as well."
1069,The Stratford Hotel,"This hotel was on a list of recommended hotels for the Star Wars Celebration being held at the ExCel . We made it out first stop on a 4 country tour in Europe. The hotel is very modern with dining options ,weekend entertainment and located steps from the London tube ,international train station and a large shopping mall . Room was quiet , very clean , comfortable beds etc. well appointed gym for a hotel . Staff were all very welcoming and helpful . We had breakfast included in our stay and the small buffet had something for everyone . We also had a lovely brunch on one of our quieter days. Highly recommend ."
1070,The Stratford Hotel,The hotel was fine and the vast majority of staff were lovely but we would not stay again if there was an event on the roof terrace. On the saturday night the noise from music went on well past midnight and we had a poor night’s sleep. With earplugs in I could still feel the bass/drums. By contrast the trains going past close by were hardly noticeable and no problem at all.
1071,The Stratford Hotel,Nice rooms for a good price however our heating did not work and this had also happened to us the last time we stayed here. Other than that i would stay again and recommend it for others i know. Rooms are also a good size
1072,The Stratford Hotel,One of the most lovely hotels we have ever stayed at! It was absolutely stunning and so modern - the whole hotel was immaculate! The staff were some of the kindest and friendliest I have ever come across in a hotel! Incredible place to stay and I will definitely return!
1073,The Stratford Hotel,Very comfortable room and a fantastic shower. The staff are extremely friendly and the buffet breakfast was great. And an extra bonus to be able to source a toothbrush and toothpaste (I had forgotten mine) .... once I had worked out how to order it on the bedside tablet!
1074,The Stratford Hotel,"Staff we very friendly and helpful, but don't inform you fully as the breakfast had an added service charge which wasn't mentioned 😕, also you pay £100 deposit which is used for upgrading your room or the service charge for breakfast, you do get this back though, rooms are lovely and spacious, the food for breakfast is filling and lots of choice, you can also go onto the TV in the room and see how much your bill is for your stay, shops, restaurants, and trains literally just 1 minute walk away, definitely will be staying again 😁"
1075,The Stratford Hotel,"Great location and the rooms were absolutely gorgeous. Comfy beds, nice shower. The only things I would say are that for the price they could at least provide free water for the rooms instead of mini bar water only. Also it can be noisy at times. I struggled to get to sleep on the Saturday night as there was an event on downstairs and I could hear the music very loudly in my room on the 4th floor. The food was nice, can be quite expensive as the drinks are also but it’s London prices. The hotel was lovely and the staff were really nice also."
1076,The Stratford Hotel,"Sadly disappointed with 2 major issues that dampened my overnight stay. At the time of checking in, there was a major issue with no hot water. It took a few hours to be resolved. This resulted in a delay for my birthday dinner. Second issue was my air conditioning fan was quite noisy around 10.30pm till before midnight. (which I reported to Anthony at the reception before checking out). That issue never happened to me before."
1077,The Stratford Hotel,"Excellent room with good facilities, unfortunately there was a water leakage around the room window which overspilled onto the carpet, everything else including the staff was excellent. We should have maybe asked to swap rooms."
1078,The Stratford Hotel,The beds are really comfortable but the rooms are really dark in the evenings as the lighting is poor. Overall all it is a fantastic hotel to book due to its proximity to the Westfield shopping centre.
1079,The Stratford Hotel,Lovely room lighting confusing to operate … great location but receptionist gave us dud directions ! Bed comfy … it was disconcerting to see into our room from the lift hall when our curtains were open - but keeping closed made it v dark
1080,The Stratford Hotel,"The perfect hotel and location . However I had a few issues with my room . The bathroom was not clean to my standard (I.e , smelt musty and there was a few hair balls at the side of the door). Although you would request dnd throughout my stay , please ensure you lock your door as cleaner seems to think it appropriate to open the door without knocking at random times ?? . If I did have another room honestly this would be rated 5/5 . The ambience , location and aesthetic is amazing , the staff was really polite."
1081,The Stratford Hotel,"Very nice hotel, room was perfect exactly what we needed for one night stay. If staying longer you may need more space. My only comment on the room would be on the water pressure in the shower, this could be greatly improved. When we were checking in there was extremely loud music being played in the restaurant. Seems like that was usual. We decided not to stay downstairs for a drink as it was far too loud we couldn’t hear each other speak."
1082,The Stratford Hotel,"Had a wonderful stay at the Stratford. The hotel is well situated for Westfield, extensive transport links and the East Village. There is loads on the doorstep and with the Elizabeth line in place only a 20minute journey to Paddington and about 10 minutes to central. I upgraded to a large room and it was very spacious. The bed was so comfortable and the bedding and pillows were gorgeous. The rainfall shower was wonderful and the Rituals products provided were a real treat. The hotel has a lot of choice when it comes to where to eat in the evening. I ate in the E20 restaurant the first night. The burger was delicious. The next evening I met friends for drinks at Allegra in the bar area. The snacks were lovely. I had the fried chicken which was a bit fabulous. The breakfast…"
1083,The Stratford Hotel,"We spent one night at The Stratford as a sleep over after a concert at the O2, which is a short walk then three stops on the Jubilee Line away. Everything about The Stratford was perfect; the location, the room, the in room facilities, the staff, the bar and the breakfast. We couldn’t fault anything. The icing on the cake is that The Stratford is dog friendly, so we will be returning with our pooches!"
1084,The Stratford Hotel,"Fabulous stay again at the Stratford. The room was amazing, and the food, as it always is, was great. But what we really like about the Stratfod is the staff. They are always really friendly, and nothing is ever too much trouble. It's a winning formula."
1085,The Stratford Hotel,"Good value, attractive hotel, ideally situated for the ABBA arena. Room was excellent. Breakfast good. Very handy for transport links. Adjacent to Stratford International train station and DLR and Westfield shopping centre."
1086,The Stratford Hotel,"Chose The Stratford only because the Premier Inn was fully booked for our dates, what a stroke of luck it turned out to be for us. We would never have known about The Stratford as we always look at booking the same hotel. On arrival it was warm welcoming and comfortable, the check in was smooth and quick and up to the room we went. The room was clean modern tidy and had everything and more we would have expected. Would I look to return, yes definitely this is now our first choice for booking at Stratford thanks everyone."
1087,The Stratford Hotel,"We had a lovely mother and daughter weekend at the Stratford. Dinner in the restaurant was delicious, as was breakfast. Saturday night at ABBA Voyage was epic. The staff at the hotel couldn't have been more helpful, especially the reception staff. The hotel clearly gets a lot of trade from ABBA , so it would be a nice gesture for the management to pay for the staff to go! I have only one gripe, a normal kettle and proper sized cups in the bedroom would be good as I am a tea addict!"
1088,The Stratford Hotel,"Our stay was perfect ! Our room was excellent, lovely bathroom and complementary toiletries, extremely comfy bed. The hotel staff were exceptional, polite, friendly and very attentive without being annoying. We ate in the restaurant and our meal was delicious, I especially liked the open kitchen. Breakfast was also excellent with a very wide selection, even for the gluten free among us! The only thing that let our stay down was the weather! Even the Stratford staff couldn’t do anything about that 😁"
1089,The Stratford Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, rooms and staff. Perfect location, spotlessly clean, impressive entrance and bar restaurant! Indoor and outside bar seating area in the sun! Modern room with coffee machine, TV, mini bar, etc. Couldn't fault it!"
1090,The Stratford Hotel,"Amazing Stay. So accommodating and great service! Can’t recommend enough. The staff were polite, the room was immaculate, and a very premium finish. If you are looking for a hotel with easy links to central London or shopping at Westfield, I cant recommend enough."
1091,The Stratford Hotel,"Fabulous hotel in convenient situation However, breakfast extremely disappointing. Reception area very claustrophobic and smelly/dark. No bottled water in room apart from expensive mini bar. No body lotion."
1092,The Stratford Hotel,"I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel and would definitely recommend it. Its located in a central spot, easy access to trains, Westfield shopping center is just a few feet away. Stayed in a Medium sized room, clean and elegant. You're able to do service requests from a nightstand tablet which was awesome. The lobby gave off a relaxing feeling. Perfect spot to chill and unwind, have dinner or catch up with friends. Even though there's a train that passes nearby, its BARELY noticeable, didnt experience any annoying sounds."
1093,The Stratford Hotel,"Excellent, friendly staff, clean and modern. Everything worked nicely. A small minus is the lack of sliced fresh veggies (e.g. cucumber, tomatoe, paprika etc.) and gluten-free pastries at breakfast."
1094,The Stratford Hotel,"We were made to wait, for 30 mins after check in as the rooms were not ready. This then made us late for a restaurant booking. One of the rooms was for 3 people, but there wasn't a 3rd bed, the pictures had 2 double beds. The bed that we got was o fold up, it was comfy, but for £135 each it was a disappointment. We had to ask for more towels, and the cups and glasses were not increased for a 3rd person. The receptionist was very off hand when I asked for for the extras. It would have been good to b able to order nibbles at the bar, and this also closed at 11pm We asked if we could buy another bottle to take to the room as the staff had cashed up for the night, This seemed very early to close. Breakfast was excellent"
1095,The Stratford Hotel,"The hotel has very friendly staff, a nice interior design, very comfortable beds and is located in a good neighbourhood with the QE Olympic Park, Westfield Mall and the Stratford underground station nearby."
1096,The Stratford Hotel,"Very modern and stylish hotel, which has retained its comfortable relaxed atmosphere with an emphasis on professional attentive service. The restaurant is very well managed and the food was excellent. The most memorable and pleasing aspect for us was the great service and attitude of the staff, they are friendly, welcoming and extremely helpful!"
1097,The Stratford Hotel,"A combination of understated elegance with a funky vibe. One of the best city hotels I’ve stayed in. From the staff (efficient, friendly, helpful) to the extremely comfortable room and cool mezzanine bar, I really couldn’t fault it."
1098,The Stratford Hotel,"This hotel ticks all the boxes. Super helpful staff, great sized rooms, very comfortable beds and pillows, immaculately clean. Choice of on-site restaurants and bars, Friday night Dj in main foyer/lounging area was just a good vibe, great for families, friends, groups, couples."
1099,The Stratford Hotel,We booked this as we were going to the Abba Arena and stayed 2 nights. It is a fabulous hotel far better than many central London hotels. All the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Room 404 was large and so good with gorgeous comfy bed. The bar area is very welcoming and a nice to relax. Breakfast was brilliant it’s a very wide selection all kept well maintained. You have a fabulous shopping mall minutes away and a short walk to the tube station. Connections to all major routes are quick so it’s easy to visit central London and all the sites. We would def stay here again! Loved it.
1100,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"I stayed at this hotel for a weekend conference that was also taking place here and checked in on the afternoon of the Friday. The year before, the conference was at a different Leonardo Royal hotel and halfway into the weekend, we experienced a fire and a power outage that lasted almost a day, so I was hoping for a better experience. The experience between the two hotels was night and day. Upon checking in, I was treated wonderfully and the whole process just took a few minutes. My room was available and this was thoroughly clean and very, very pleasant. Apart from having an interesting experience on the first morning for breakfast where, as a solo traveller, I lost my table and then had my drink cleared away when I hadn't finished at my new table, the staff were so welcoming…"
1101,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Great place and super hospitable staff. Arun at the Frontdesk is a superstar. He helped us with an early checkin and made sure we were comfortable while we waited. Great location and walking distance from some key tourist attractions.
1102,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"We booked 1 night stay with breakfast and spa treatment. We have been very well looked after, and especially Rayyan made me and my friends experience just perfect by making sure we had the best room! Thank you we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend."
1103,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"I love the overall look & location of the hotel. My room was very nice, clean & comfortable. The shower felt great, the staff was helpful & friendly, and the pool is amazing. Only 5 minutes from London Tower/Bridge, and with the Underground only a block away made getting around very convenient."
1104,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Clean and well furnished rooms, very bright. Air conditioning and all the necessary services. Abundant and varied breakfast. High quality restaurant. Excellent and fast service. Kind and always available staff. Gorgeous pool and spa."
1105,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,I always stay at this hotel when I am in London. Great Location and high quality accomodation. Close to all the sights many within walking distance. Staff are always helpful and Rayyan was extremely helpful on the front desk. I highly recommend this hotel.
1106,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"We showed up with a booking for Sept rather than June - I was mortified, but Yoanita at reception helped me not only calm down but was also able to find us a room for the night, without paying anything additional, and even added breakfast included for us. The hotel itself is chock full of amenities including a pool, steam, and sauna, and the room was extremely comfortable. Restaurant food was very yummy too! Can't thank them enough and would 100% recommend."
1107,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"1st time staying at Leonardo Tower Bridge and will defo be back, our weekend was made all the more special following checkin where Makul went above and beyond to make sure our stay was a memorable one. Our Room was on the 12th floor with fantastic views of the city, including the Shard, Tower Bridge and The Gherkin plus more. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and the omelette station was really good, Bar was very modern with great service and the pool area was a welcomed one especially in the heatwave. Location of hotel very good and would recommend a visit to St Katherine's Dock which is about a 10-15 min walk, nearest tube station is aldgate which gets you to most places."
1108,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"yesterday I got 7 rooms need to check in, and all Clint's wanna different floors and lucky room number. staff rayyan is very helpful, also rayyan is very professional ,patient,and nice. help me solve all the problem. there is two rooms need high floors and rayyan helped me change 3 times for that room. thank you rayyan."
1109,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Lovey hotel. The customer service I received from Rayyan at reception desk was great. He ensured my check in was smooth and helped with any queries I had with a smile on his face. Room was beautiful.
1110,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,The staff here is absolutely amazing!! Abdul and his staff has been incredibly kind and accommodating. I have loved the breakfast and late night drinks. Wonderful location for site seeing. Very close to bus stops. The staff filled our water bottles with ice and water every day! The weather has been super warm. Would love to stay here again and spend more time in the area.
1111,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Room is very nice, the entire room is decorated with elegance. The bathroom is also very elegant with a bathtub and a separate shower. Had dinner in the dining room and our waiter, Rafiz was great."
1112,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"The entire staff was friendly. Room clean and bed very comfortable. We were there for my husband’s birthday. Claudia went above and beyond to make the day memorable for us. When we came back from sight seeing she surprised us with balloon, wine and a small cake all set in our room. Thanks to all of you for doing that."
1113,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"The reason for the poor review is unfortunately due to my Bose speaker being stolen from my room. In preparation for my kidney donation which I’m currently recovering from, my friend booked a spa treatment and short stay at the hotel. To begin with, the spa service was quite nice and the masseuse was lovely, however the pool facilities were underwhelming. The following morning we noted we had missed the opportunity for room service and I called the concierge to determine whether we could order breakfast to the room, I was told I couldn’t and the concierge suggested I would need to visit the buffet which i accepted whilst confirming the opening/closing times. In anticipation of the checkout which would essentially follow immediately after breakfast, I packed my belongings…"
1114,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,We stayed 11 days at this wonderful hotel behind the Tower of London. Beautifully decorated with spacious rooms and comfortable beds. The room service was quick and the food excellent. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We look forward to visiting again.
1115,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,From the moment we walked in we were made to feel special above and beyond! From Chica through concierge made us say wow! To the hotel manager made us say wow! To raayan at check-in. Wow!! To Ahmed in the restaurant!!! Wow!!! They all went out of their norm to make us feel special. ! We will definitely stay again every thing! Was FANTASTIC!! THANK YOU LEONARDO TOWER HOTEL
1116,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Luxury hotel with everything and anything you might think you'd need on a nice vacation with friends. We especially liked the amazing view on the city lights at night, the swimming pool with spa and the delicious breakfast with a huge variety of options to choose from."
1117,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Stayed regularly in recent months for work trips. Front desk staff all v helpful (esp Yoanita), rooms good size and well equipped, gym and pool well maintained, good choice of food in room service and restaurant, breakfasts well stocked. Lifts are only bugbear …you can wait a long time for a lift!"
1118,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,The hotel is in a very good location and has all the facilities. The rooms are good sized and the amenities are good. I stayed overnight with my wife on 01.06.2023 to attend a ceremony next door. The bathroom had a very strong pungent smell like smelly socks/dead animal and you couldn’t stay in the toilet for more than a minute… the smell eased to a tolerable extent by next day morning. I wondered whether they was a drainage issue or it has got something with the cleaning product. I informed the front desk atleast 3 times but I don’t think they were bothered. I was also not really interested pursuing with my displeasure since I was checking out in the morning. I don’t usually complain but this smell was really horrible. I hope the hotel looks at it. I stayed in Room 218.. If…
1119,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,The beds were so comfortable and the hotel was spotless . The breakfast was great and the location is perfect for sight seeing and the tube . Even a swimming pool although I did not use this . Would stay again 😊
1120,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Rayyan from the reception made our check in very easy and very welcoming. He’s a great guy and really cares about his job. The hotel was really nice. The room was very clean and spacious . The pool and jacuzzi area was very relaxing and sanitised. Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who’s coming to London and wants to stay in a central location for a good price.
1121,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Great hotel. Special thanks to Mr John, who perfectly took care of us as our Customer Service Expert at the reception. Beds are bery comfortable, rooms are spacious. Location and accesibility to the hotel are great. Highly recommended as a place to stay during intense stay in London!"
1122,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant, great drinks and amazing service by Ahmed. The atmosphere was great, a nice place to go with friends for dinner or a drink. Ahmed was super friendly and very accommodating."
1123,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,I have never felt more at home while traveling than I did at Leonardo Royal. Amo & Claudia made sure my stay was impeccable. While Shajeeb & Shajahan took care of us and delivered customer service I’ve never experienced. Please go visit them at Leo’s bar and try the Pink Elephant; Shajahan’s specialty. you won’t regret staying at Leonardo Royal Tower bridge this has been the most impeccable traveling experience I’ve ever had
1124,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Had the most amazing experience at this hotel! Every member of the staff was extremely kind and helpful. Shajahan made us his wonderful specialty cocktail ‘pink elephant’ that had me me and my friends sat by the bar all night. The rooms were super comfy, which really made me feel at home. Amo made sure our stay was perfectly up to par. Could not recommend more!"
1125,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Rayyan was very nice and welcoming, had an amazing time. Facilities were all great and working. Room was clean and tidy and everything was great. I look forward to coming back again. Thank you team and rayyan for your hospitality."
1126,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"As always the Leonardo Royal London doesn’t disappoint. Staff are 1st class, always helpful and accommodating. All areas are spotlessly clean as are rooms. Breakfast is brilliant. We always stay here when in London because its so close to Tower Bridge. Highly recommend."
1127,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Lovely experience. We were having a little goodbye gathering and it was very relaxing. The facilities were good although at times busy. We were able to use everything and the relaxation room was a nice addition. We were supplied gowns and slippers which was great.
1128,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Pre-booking and after booking I received quick communication from staff - Shoutout to Gabriella, who was super helpful in organising romantic options for the room. We arrived early and were able to leave our bags at the hotel so we could explore the area. Check-in was smooth. Claudia, our customer service expert, truly made our room special and walking in the first time was unforgettable! We were just blown away with everything: stunning view, beautiful decorations, and a few surprises. The spa was neat, pool and hot tub was nice. Bar and lounge has a nice ambience. It was a magical stay!"
1129,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"We visited for a 3 night stay. Check in process was fine. Problems with the room were immediate with the smell of raw sewage very heavy in the room/bathroom. Initial complaint to the main desk was poor... the solution from housekeeping being some glade air freshener. I thought the main desk was not very reactive in their approach nor any need for urgency.... usual excuses... we fix when we can, we are fully booked etc.. It would have been very clear to housekeeping regards this smell, there should have a feedback mechanism to stop such rooms being released for use. We had to escalate to the duty manager who immediately moved us to a different room. I fully appreciate the managerial response. Post this initial issue, the rest of our stay was was fine. Swimming pool is…"
1130,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Leornado review ..... Trip Advising......add photo of 2nd room. Thanks We had a fabulous stay but not without its problems but Yoanita at reception made it all better for us - her professionalism, compassion and generosity. Nothing was too much of a problem. The lifts were not working and most bizarrely it was when we were here 6 months back. Yes, we were on the 11th floor and used the stairs because we could no longer wait for the service lift. Our original room, with fab views was also beside an overworked service lift that kept us awake. Thank you again to Yaonita for sorting it all out. Despite all this, we felt valued and can't wait to be back. You were great, especially voluntarily offering us a partial refund."
1131,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Excellent location. Excellent customer service. Very warm welcome received from front of desk staff member Rayyan. Lovely smile, made us feel at home straight away. Enquired as to where we were from, what was the reason for our stay etc., Allocated us a really lovely room on the top floor, (room 1406) with excellent views over the City of London. Spa treatment facilities were nice. We were provided with robes, towels, slippers. Tea and coffee whilst waiting and relaxing. Staff were friendly, but not over talkative, as they knew we were hear to relax and enjoy the peace and tranquility. We were given a drinks voucher for 2 x Mocktails - F.O.C. Very nice. We only stayed one night, as we had other plans. Breakfast choice was excellent. Service with a smile. Very clean and well…"
1132,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Arun provided a great check in experience with great tips on dining and drinking experiences! He greeted us with a smile and provided an amplitude of activities for my wife and I and friends. He certainly provided a great start to our London trip!
1133,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"I visited the Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge Hotel April 22 - 29, 2023. It was part of a tour package with Collette. The staff were great. Especially Arun and Rayyan. They took really good care of me. I was not use to how things worked in England and they showed me. They also made sure my bathroom was fixed. The room was neat, clean, and nicely furnished. There was a television, Wi-Fi, and landline. The room did not have an alarm clock. But my phone was able to wake me up just fine. The hotel is in walking distance to the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, and the HMS Belfast. I would suggest getting an oyster card and putting a travel pass on it. It makes exploring the city so much easier. There are convenience stores near by for your basic needs. And the…"
1134,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Me and my daughter checked into this hotel having travelled to London from Lytham to find that our apartment (booked via another website) was a scam. We googled, hopped in a cab and booked into this hotel instead. I was quite stressed out and a bit shaky on arrival - Rayyan on reception calmed me down, found us a beautiful room, a complimentary breakfast and we felt like we would be looked after now. The room was lovely. Breakfast was good and as my daughter is coeliac she found she did have a lot of options. Food brought out separately for her was served by staff wearing gloves which reassured her about cross contamination. All in all a great stay and we will be back hopefully to try the spa."
1135,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"We had a wonderful stay at the hotel. We were only there for 2 nights. Check-in was easy and the folks behind the desk were friendly and helpful. Room was clean, bed was firm (I liked). The only thing missing in the room was access to a refrigerator. The staff in the restaurant were very helpful (as that is where you went for ice). Breakfast had a nice wide selection of items including an omelet station. Makul at the desk was very helpful. All in all, it was a good stay."
1136,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"This has been a great experience! Ravyan at the front desk was very helpful, got us into our room early, and the room itself was very spacious and clean. We loved that the hotel was a short walk away from the Tower of London and the Tower Hill subway stop which made it easy to get to all the local attractions. I would highly recommend staying here for your next trip to London."
1137,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"A wonderful hotel with very friendly staff. Rayyan at reception was especially helpful and accommodating of our last minute stay as a family. Location was close to Tower of London but still in a quiet street, so it was easy to sleep. Thanks for the stay."
1138,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,I’m currently having a short Holliday with my girl in leonardo royal tower bridge hotel London and it’s absolutely amazing experience ‘from the accommodation to the view pleasantly surprise to see the shard and the iconic view of the tower bridge ‘the room is clean and daily serviced the housekeeping staff are friendly and very professional ‘but I would like to thank Claudia from guest relations that was wonderful from the beginning helping us with accommodation and tips and we got a welcome to this great hotel like nothing else to make our stay absolutely fantastic ‘
1139,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,The view it’s amazing 😍 perfect cleaning service. The whole hotel looks amazing! Your personnel’s are great! That food from hotel restaurant was amazing like the personnel who was taking care of us ( Ahmed & Shajib ). We totally enjoyed the stay at this gorgeous hotel! 🩷I’m sure we will come again soon! 🩷
1140,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Shajib was a legend. He provided us with an exceptional experience of afternoon tea at the hotel. He impressed with his knowledge of teas. Lots of smiles. We will return in the future. Great location
1141,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Wonderful facility from top to bottom. Special mention to our bartender Shajahan. Excellent bartender with an array of custom cocktails and a sparkling personality. Certainly one of the highlights of our visit to London.
1142,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"I have had an extraordinary stay at this hotel! I am traveling solo to visit with my children and grandchildren, and this hotel has been my second home! The room is wonderful and I have had nothing but good sleep at night in the very comfortable bed. The housekeepers are very efficient and I come back every night to a nice tidy room and clean bathroom. But there is more! Since I am solo and don’t go out at night, my place to hang out is downstairs in the restaurant and bar called Leo’s. Amo, a gentleman at the front desk is a friendly chap with a great sense of humor and always has me cracking up! Amo, along with many members of the staff of Leo’s have become my second family, and they are wonderful! Much thanks and a shout out to my new, dear, and accommodating friends who work…"
1143,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,A well positioned hotel to see the sights in London or travel along the river to go further affield. There is a good bar with a large lounge area as well as several sitting areas. Breakfast was very good with lots of choices to suit most dietary needs. The room was spacious with a decent size bathroom but an awful view.
1144,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,This hotel is amazing!!! We dined at Leo’s Restaurant in the hotel and Shajib our waiter was AWESOME !!!! I am GeForce the dining experience he provided. He left wanting nothing. He frequently checked on us and his recommendations were delicious and tasty. Shajib made our dining experience one for the books. I will be returning. Thank you again Shajib.
1145,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Leonardo Royal hotel, Tower-bridge is very good hotel bot in terms of location, hospitality & customer care. Especially i would like to share that Makul Malik is exceptional person with approach of customer first. Keep it up Leonardo Royal - Tower Bridge team."
1146,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,Shajib was our waiter and he was extremely attentive and kind. The food was delicious and the menu was wonderfully crafted! We had porn star martinis and they were scrumptious! We definitely will be returning for the great food and service!
1147,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"Honestly, my stay at the Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge hotel was impressive! Hands down the best experience I've had in a London hotel. First of all, it is cheaper to book a room on their actual website than using sites like booking.com. Secondly, as we were checking in, Rayyan at the front desk was incredible. He was very attentive and upgraded our room from the standard superior room that I booked to an executive room on the 12th floor! The view was beautiful and the room itself was magnificent and there was a bathtub in the room too! The hotel staff also left a lovely message for us and a dessert too as we were celebrating our birthday :) It was truly a lovely experience and I never have received a better experience at other hotels. The personal touches were amazing!…"
1148,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,A very very good hôtel with exelent staff thanks you so much for all . We pass 3 excelent days and we hope se you soon For another week-end. Nous recommandons chaleureusement cette hôtel au cœur de Londres .
1149,Leonardo Royal London Tower Bridge,"I was served immediately by Rayyan despite it being busy, he got us checked in quickly no less than 5 minutes, we checked in early which was a bonus, our room was very spacious clean very modern, the location was also perfect would recommend staying here, all staff members were lovely especially Rayyan."
1150,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"My family and I stayed here in April. We were excited to experience a W=A product in Scotland and the price we were paying set our expectations quite high for a great weekend. The hotel is very dated and the corridors were tired and carpets stained. We had a “family suite” which was drab, dark (interior facing, minimal light), and tired. Pool staff was helpful, but the whole pool area was quite sad an inadequate. You also need to go downstairs to come upstairs into the pool. Very inconvenient, especially with young kids. Staff confirmed that the hotel was going through a sales process and needed “50M in renovations.” That’s obvious. Staff also used hotel facilities (like the gym) during regular business hours, which I found quite odd. We booked through American…"
1151,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,Been at the hotel for 24 hours waiting to change rooms. Americans Express platinum member gets you a moldy smelling Premium king room Requested to move to another room last night when we checked in. Nothing in the whole hotel available except a 5th floor room that was left over from a youth hostel and was about 95 degrees since the 5th floor is an unrenovated attic. We asked for an air filter so we could sleep in the vile smelling room. None available. They were to move us today and we came back to relax for a few hours and its 3:30pm and we are still in the vile smelling room waiting to be moved. I don’t understand why anyone would stay at this hotel.
1152,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,The Waldorf Astoria is truly a tired and old hote and does not belong on any 5 star list. It is a three star experience with awful rooms. They gave me a room above a loading place for the kitchen. Room was too small to move. Bed very hard.
1153,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Recently ended a 10 day trip to Scotland, and final night of the trip was spent at The Caledonian in Edinburgh. We are very familiar with the area the hotel is in, and chose it for its location mostly. It has wonderful views of Edinburgh Castle. It is very conveniently located with great access to Old and New Town. Many good restaurants nearby. The hotel staff is mostly international. They were very attentive. The Hotel is beautiful. Our room, while well appointed, and with excellent Castle view, was small and felt cramped. Not much bigger than a cruise ship cabin really. The only other negative is that the location, though very convenient, is also very busy, with a lot of street activity and noise. It is overall a very nice place to stay, but not my favorite in…"
1154,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Lovely hotel in the heart of Edinburgh near George St., fine restaurants and not far from the Edinburgh Castle. The hotel is elegant in every way from its decor to the amenities of a spa, fine dining and attentive concierge services. The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming with information on what to do and where to eat. Our room had a wonderful view of the Edinburgh Castle. We would stay again in this historic and friendly place!"
1155,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Lovely traditional hotel. Excellent hospitality by all the staff, breakfast was great and the room large and very clean. The hotel is in a great location at the end of Princess street and definitely a great base for any visit."
1156,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,The Waldorf Astoria - Caledonian was the perfect place for us to stay on our trip to Edinburgh. We were there 3 nights and it was a great central location for the city we really wanted to explore. We walked all over and saw a lot of the city and the hotel was easy to get to. The complimentary breakfast options were delicious (and plentiful) and we loved the beautiful atrium dining room. Our room had giant high ceilings and was very roomy and comfortable and we had beautiful views of Edinburgh Castle. We were on the side street and did not hear any outside noises. The other couple with us were in a room that was close to the hotel entrance and they said they could hear some of the busy street out front. But the staff were terrific - friendly and helpful.
1157,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Excellent location, wonderful staff, historic building. They were most helpful, attended to every request. This is highly recommended place to stay if you want to enjoy the great city of Edinburgh. Easy check-in and check-out. This hotel has everything.

At Caleybar we were served delicious drinks by Ethan, Thomas, Damien and Melanie who were very attentive with us.

1161,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Gorgeous hotel! We stayed in two different rooms because our stay was extended due to a flight cancellation, and both were extremely comfortable with incredible views of the castle. The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff was super friendly. The location was great, and it was easy to get everywhere we wanted to go from there. We will absolutely stay here again on our next trip to Edinburgh."
1162,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"My best friend and I caught up with each other with an overnight stay at the Waldorf. From the second we arrived we were made to feel so welcome.

The impeccable service, delicious food selections and ambiance all ensure a wonderful experience. The staff all go out of the way to be helpful and friendly. It is a truly beautiful historic hotel that is beautifully maintained. The chocolates provided each night as part of the turndown service are a nice touch."
1164,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,the Waldorf Astoria or Caledonian or Caley as the locals call it is a marvelous historical hotel situated in view of Edinburgh Castle. our upgraded room was incredible and luxurious as was every staff member greeting. The peacock lounge restaurant was fantastic for daily breakfast .

Fantastic location with lots of attractions in walking distance. We can’t wait to come back to Edinburgh and stay at this lovely property again.
1166,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"This hotel can only be described as Edinburgh’s finest! From check-in to Check-out you’ll be looked after with care. The Staff is so friendly, Customer oriented and answer all your questions in a professional way. As we were there for birthday celebrations they made sure that all departments were aware and we were welcomed with a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates in our room. The room itself had an amazing view over Edinburgh Castle. We did get a complimentary upgrade because of my Golden Hilton Honours Status. So it’s worth to enrol into their program. Apparently there is a Sabrage of Champagne daily at 15:00 (3pm) which we luckily could witness. Breakfast is on par with anyone’s taste and a good à la carte to choose from. Here service is also presented with a genuine…"

1170,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,A really amazing stay at Waldorf Astoria - The Caledonian. This hotel is perfectly located on one edge of princess street. Really good Castle views from hotel rooms. Also has top-notch service. Front-desk team especially Kristina and Laura did a really good job in helping me during my stay!
1171,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,The hotel is beautiful—the beds are wonderfully comfortable and service is great. Pamela in housekeeping was lovely. S gracious. The location of the hotel is also perfect and my room has great castle views.
1172,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,We had an amazing stay at the Waldorf Astoria. My wife and I brought our 4 year old daughter to stay for a few days. The staff was not only attentive but so friendly. My daughter made a point to go back to Peacock alley to see her “friends”. We had dinner at both restaurants with our daughter while we were at the hotel. Everywhere and everyone was great with our little one and an amazing experience for all of us. The indoor pool was also a big hit.
1173,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Can’t praise the staff enough , was there for my husbands birthday and he was made to feel so special, from the beer in the room and 2 birthday cards and especially when we went for an afternoon tea today . Iona went above and beyond was just so lovely , she brought out a plate with happy birthday on it and beautifully decorated with fresh fruit and chocolate and even sang him happy birthday , The gentleman behind the bar made me a lovely mocktail as I said I was driving . Breakfast was delicious and so much variety and even when we came in late from a show the young man in the bar made up tea before bed . I have never met such a lovely bunch of staff and especially the concierge who parked our car and helped with our case . Thank you for making our stay so wonderful."
1174,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"My son and I had a wonderful breakfast experience at the Waldorf Astoria. Gintare and Sam offered the best service! The eggs royale and the Scottish salmon were truly delicious. The salon is gorgeous and the atmosphere extremely relaxing, with classical music. Highly recommended!"
1175,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"I will admit that the minute we entered the room, I was disappointed. We had just come from a very well-appointed hotel in a historical building and immediately you could see that The Caledonian was showing its age. Now, that being said, the hotel is in a fantastic area. You are right in the center of everything. There are great pubs, restaurants, music venues just around the bend. Right down the hill from the Royal Mile, National Gallery, Charles Street, Rose Street, so shopping, eating and drinking are a stone's throw. We had a double twin room with a castle view. We did get a lovely welcome plate of tea cakes, Gin and Fever tree mixers that was greatly appreciated. We checked out the pool and spa area. It might be great if you want a spa service. It felt a little odd getting…"
1176,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,This was marvelous. The staff and the amenities are impeccable. The location is very convenient and the castle views are stunning. Highly recommend staying here. Will certainly be back. The service was excellent

They made my first visit to Edinburgh one I will never forget."
1179,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Had a lovely stay at waldorf Astoria - Caledonian, Edinburgh. The hotel is a great place to stay if you want time to chill and relax. The hotel has a great relaxed atmosphere and staff are friendly while still professional. Nothing is to much trouble. I highly recommend this hotel."
1180,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Our stay at the beautiful Waldorf Astoria was made better by several people. I cannot imagine our trip being as enjoyable as it was without them. From the moment we walked into the hotel, Laura, at the front desk, ensured our every need was met. Her enthusiasm and smiles were delightful. Nicola A., in housekeeping, made sure we were greeted by clean rooms and lovely special touches. We appreciate her professionalism! Victoria G., our concierge, suggested and scheduled events for us that provided views and “tastes” of Edinburgh that we wouldn’t have had without her. Don’t miss meeting these gems at the Waldorf!"
1181,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,Stayed at the Waldorf in early May and had a phenomenal stay. As a Hilton Diamond we received a modest upgrade to a larger king room with castle view and had connecting rooms for our 2 reservations. Breakfast was included and perfectly on point. Highly recommended. We also had afternoon tea which was spectacular as well. Special standouts were Laura at the front desk and the housekeeping manager (I believe Zusana?) who went above and beyond in making our stay perfect.
1182,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"This hotel is an exceptional experience, with luxurious rooms, exceptional service, and top-notch amenities from room service, thank you Paulina and Eleni for your lovely birthday cards. So many wonderful touches from Housekeeping too, special mention to Nicola who left our room spotless every day and beautifully arranged my nephew's toys for his surprise. Thank you Ria Anne, Catherine and Gary in Reception and Concierge for your attention to detail and recommendations. My sister had one of the best treatments at the Spa with Maria, she can't wait to be back! Dining options at Grazing are outstanding and the staff is attentive and friendly, Nitin and Melony are true stars. Breakfast at Peacock was one of the best my family and I we ever had, thank you Gintare and Sam for making…"
1183,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"My husband and I stayed 2 nights for our 10 year anniversary and were spoiled from start to finish. Upon check in we received an upgrade to a castle view room due to our anniversary, there was prosecco, chocolates and a lovely card waiting in the room for us, it was so much appreciated. The staff were all lovely and the hotel itself gorgeous and full of character. Breakfast was fantastic, I loved the fruit starter especially. Everyone we spoke to were so professional but with personality too and it felt like a proper treat for us. We didn’t have dinner at hotel but can vouch for the cocktails being outstanding! I had a spa treatment which I’ve left a separate review for as it was the best facial I’ve ever had. Thank you again for our wonderful stay, we will be back!"
1184,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"The customer service was unmatched! I wanted for nothing during my stay. Everyone was amazing but a few stood out: Ria Anne, Analine, Cassie (Sorna), Mark (concierge) and Thomas (Jameson - bartender). Pillows were like clouds. The mattress was a tad too firm for my liking but my room and throughout the hotel was immaculate. I also recommend the breakfast - freshest berries I have ever had!"

1186,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,I attended a business event recently in one of the private dining suites . The staff were very attentive and the meal was delicious and well presented. I would love to stay and experience breakfast also as I am a travel agent so like to experience first hand so that I can provide an honest appraisal / recommendations to clients
1187,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"The arrival was very welcoming and friendly. The hotel is simply stunning with a great atmosphere. The rooms were very clean and the service from all areas was nothing short of perfect, the beds…to die for! My biggest thing from a hotel, cleanliness and this was pretty high standard! Happy happy travellor!!!"
1188,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"This is the best hotel I’ve stayed in! The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous! The food is superb. Everyone there treats you like your royalty! From the doorman to the person who turns your bed down at night. So polite and helpful! It’s in a great area and around shops,gardens , restaurants. It’s a must to stay there."
1189,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"This was my 2nd stay at the Caledonian and it won’t be my last. I was lucky enough to stay for a week in a very comfortable room that had stunning views of the castle. Breakfast was outstanding as was the service ( I recommend the Eggs Benedict). All staff were welcoming, attentive and very friendly. This was not only impressive but made my stay such a memorable experience."
1190,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"The charm of this hotel goes beyond the exterior presence and is instilled in the people who work there. My mom and I finished our two-week holiday in Scotland at the Waldorf Astoria and it did not disappoint. We had exceptional service from Lucas in the Peacock Lounge every night we were there. (They make an amazing French 75 that I highly recommend.) On our last evening there we had dinner at Grazing... all I can say is WOW... Nitin (what a gem he was) and his crew went above and beyond to make everything perfect. (Get the Beef Wellington, you will not be disappointed... and the sticky pudding soufflé- Oh My Word! I died and went to Heaven) I can't say enough about how great everything, and everyone was there. I would give them 6 stars if possible! We can't wait to come back…"
1191,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,A lovely hotel in a great location at the top of Princes Street about a 10 minute walk to the castle and the Royal Mile. Our room (306) was a double double and we were given a discounted upgrade following us needing to change dates at very short notice and our original room not being available…the hotel were very good and accommodating about the change. The room was very spacious and had a great view of the castle. It lacked a couple of the basics but overall was well presented and very clean. The Peacock Alley for breakfast was very nice and also a lovely place for pre drinks on an evening. Breakfast was good although a little rushed with our mains arriving before we had finished our starter. We also very much enjoyed our night caps in the Caley bar and received excellent…
1192,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Just splendid. The hotel staff was very polite and friendly, rooms were clean, quiet and spacious and the breakfast options were some of the best in town. The pool is still running under a pandemic/reservation system but was easy to get into when we wanted to get some exercise. If you have a chance to stay here, don't pass it by."
1193,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"The staff make this hotel a 5 star experience, not the building. Excellent customer service skills and friendly effective communication. We had some teething issues on arrival and had to move rooms, request toiletries and have maintenance attend. Not an ideal start for a planned luxury break. Also Fire alarms going off on our floor and standing outside on the street in the rain one evening with no communication only to find business as usual when we went around to the front entrance. Food in general was very good apart from the fruit platter at breakfast which was of a low standard. A special mention to staff member Princess who quickly took personal responsibility to restore our faith and confidence. An excellent listener and problem solver who also made my little girl smile. A…"
1194,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Excellent hotel and location close to everything. You can take bus number 100 and get off very close to this hotel. The rooms are very clean, well appointed. The only problem is the slippery tubs. They are downright dangerous for the older person. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The food at the restaurant needs improvement, however the service is excellent. Noteworthy mentions: Elena, Stephanie and Gintara at the restaurant go above and beyond providing excellent service to guests. They made our stay more pleasurable."
1195,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,From the greeting to the end of my spa time everyone was very helpful and gave great service. Sarah gave and excellent massage. Would love to go again. My friend decided to go later in the day on my recommendation. Enjoyed afternoon tea in Peacock Alley afterwards. Lovely!
1196,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,Excellent hotel. The service was fantastic from the greeters at the door and lobby to the turndown service. We had a view room that looked at the castle and it was very worth the extra price. My family of four(two adults and two older teens) shared this room with 2 queen beds and it was very roomy. Breakfast and high tea at Peacock Alley were prompt and delicious. We highly recommend this hotel.
1197,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"A beautiful hotel and such a warm welcome. Happy, friendly and helpful staff everywhere! It was a very busy hotel but we were always greeted and helped efficiently. Delicious breakfasts, no rush to finish. Great Caley Bar with warm friendly staff. One in particular went out of his way to help."
1198,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"The warmth and friendliness of the staff at the Caledonian from Karen’s front desk welcome, concierge recommendations and the doormen asking us about that day’s plans or adventure made us feel like family, which was above and beyond other 5 star hotels. We were in the heart of the city and walked almost everywhere. The proximity of the hotel to historic sites. We were literally looking at Edinburgh Castle outside the window, but that was only a small part of what makes this a great place to stay. The time many team members took to engage us and inquire about our college age daughter’s experiences (whom we were visiting during her semester abroad) showed genuine interest and enthusiasm that we enjoy ourselves. We cannot say enough about the extra care they showed us, and we…"
1199,Waldorf Astoria Edinburgh - The Caledonian,"Had a great nights sleep here. Misaki was absolutely brilliant at check in. Quick, polite and informative. She certainly got our trip started on the right bounce. Id recommend staying here to anyone."
1200,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"It’s a very clean and new hotel. It’s directly connected to T2 via its car park on L1. Staff are humorous and friendly. It should be one of the most friendly and convenient airport hotels in Heathrow. It’s a right choice for travellers of all kinds, especially business and solo travellers."
1201,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Excellent hotel for business trips, very close to the airport allows easy access to business meetings in the area but also proximity to nearby corporate hubs. Clean and spacious enough. Excellent check in experience thanks to Sohrab in reception."
1202,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Great & convenient location. Hilton sleep experience (*****). Shout out to Sohrab for his guidance and advice to ensure stress free check-in, checking my flight details and organising transportation the next day."
1203,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Check in with Sohrab was excellent, was made to feel welcomed straight away. Dinner was nice, service felt impersonal but the food was good. A little overpriced but it’s a hotel restaurant so can’t be helped. Can’t beat it for location!"
1204,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"This property is great for an overnight stay before departing from LHR. The high-floor rooms have great views across all the activities on the airfield. The room has plenty of hanging space for clothes, a desk, two chairs, and a safe. There are tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom has a good quality shower with a rain shower and hand attachment. The staff in the rooftop bar are friendly with great selection of beers and snacks. Enjoy the aircraft taking off and landing whilst eating/drinking. Thoroughly recommend"
1205,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Overall excellent experience! Food was tasty, I had the pizza margherita. Nishu provided wonderful service, she was very attentive and checked in on me throughout the meal to make sure everything was to my liking. If staying at the Hilton I would highly recommend."
1206,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Lovely food served quickly. Friendly service by Savio and team. Clean and relaxed atmosphere. Enjoyed the steak, nice and tender. Fishing and chips was freshing and 'homemade' Nice environment to eat."
1207,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"5/5 rating for sure! People are friendly and very patient. Mr. Sohrab is a humorous and professional helper in the front desk! Overall, you will get short great break from the overloaded flight transit time - if you don’t know where should go during the layover time, choose here!"
1208,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"We chose this hotel purely for convenience. It is a 10-15 minute undercover walk from the Central bus station for National Express coaches and also the underground. It has direct access to Terminal 2. Of course you are paying for this convenience. The rooms are a good size with comfortable beds and very good triple glazing so you can’t hear any outside noise. The bar on the top floor is called the Runway Bar and has views of the runway, selling drinks and a limited food menu. The main restaurant is the Apron restaurant and bar which is on the same level as the reception. We had an evening meal of Teriyaki Baby Pork Ribs which was very nice. I can’t remember what I had for dessert, so it wasn’t very memorable. However, my husband had Crème Brûlée, which he was very disappointed…"
1209,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Very helpful staff all round. Being elderly we needed a little more assistance and nothing was a trouble to them. Room was excellent and breakfast, which was included in our booking was way beyond our expectations"
1210,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"A great place to stay when you need to be close to the airport. It is conveniently located to Heathrow T2 & T3, and easy to get into London via the tube or Heathrow Express. Check in was fabulous, with Songab upgrading the room, late check out and bottles of water. The runway bar is a nice touch, however service was slow (25 minutes before someone came to give me a menu and then extra time before coming to order - note, by 30minutes I gave up and left). The restaurant and bar on the lower level was far more responsive, with the team giving good service. The room itself was clean, good size and quiet with extra window glazing - nothing special. Being able to bring your luggage trolley with you into the hotel and room was a great bonus."
1211,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Great service by Souhrab, very friendly and attentive. Really had a pleasant stay thanks his advice despite a very long day traveling. Felt very good to arrive at Hilton and be taken care of in this way"
1212,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Top notch hotel with very professional and friendly staff. “Vally” in the rooftop bar was particularly helpful. Location is very good for a preflight stay. And Breakfast was one of the best of our two week UK visit.
1213,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"We stayed overnight at this hotel when we flew into and out of LHR Terminal 2. The hotel was very easy to find and was a very short walk through a parking garage to get to the lobby. The beds weren't the most comfortable, but the room was clean and you really cannot beat the location of this hotel if you're flying out of Terminal 2. We received free breakfast as a benefit of Hilton status, and it was a larger spread that I anticipated and a great way to start off the day before getting on our morning flight. When we arrived around 11 p.m., it was too late to get room service or food at the restaurant. They did have a little pantry where you could get snacks. but it would have been nice to have some hot food options. It was really great to be able to get a good night's sleep…"
1214,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Convenient hotel next to terminals 2 and 3 connect via a short walkway. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. There was a convenient restaurant downstairs and a stunning panoramic rooftop bar with a 360 degree view of planes taking off and landing. The staff were also especially friendly, thanks Natalia for the warm welcome to my morning breakfast."
1215,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,We have stayed here on multiple occasions & always find the rooms very clean & the beds very comfortable. On checking in Sohrab was most courteous & very helpful & did his utmost to assist us with arranging special assistance access & pick up with the Heathrow Terminal staff. He was very kind to us. Thank you Sohrab!
1216,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Great Indian food, in addition to fish n chips and all the comfort foods. Friendly atmosphere. Doesn’t feel like you’re eating at the airport. Savio our waiter went above a beyond to spoil our kids! I would definite come back again the next time I’m in Heathrow."
1217,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"The hotel is very modern and conveniently located near Terminal 2. You can walk from Terminal 3 in about 10 minutes. The rooms are excellent and have all the needed amenities to refresh, take a nap or relax away from the noisy airport. They allowed me to check in at 10 AM with no problems,"
1218,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"QUIET! And it’s right next to the airport. We had one of the best meals of our trip at the Anchor Restaurant. Our server, Savio, was excellent! Drinks in the Runway bar were spot on. Order a Tom Collins or a Gin Gimlet. Amazing! If you need to stay over at Heathrow, come here. Or, come here for your last night in London before flying out. AAA+++"
1219,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Runway Rooftop - Great place to have a drink and snack over looking the runways! Great service, food and drink. Big thanks to Vinny and his team for looking after us and making our evening very nice. Look forward to next visit. Perfect for Terminal 2 and 3 being across the road."
1220,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Sohrab gave us a great reception on atrival! Nice hotel adjacent to the airport. Great price too. Room was superb and the breakfast was very yummy . Terminal 3 is a 15 minute easy walk with the luggage.
1221,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Sohrab was great. The room was nice and he guided us on how to see the palace. The restaurant was great. And there is easy access to go into central London from our hotel. I love how it is connected to the airport, which makes flying a lot easier."
1222,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Smooth check in and my host Sohrab went over and above to make my stay comfortable and convinient. Big shout out to him. The rooms and facilities are great and super easy to access terminal 2 & 3, definitely recommend"
1223,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Expensive as expected for an airport hotel restaurant, but the service was unexpectedly poor. While our primary server Savio was polite, there seemed to be no communication between servers. Almost all our food and drink items were given to the wrong person, we were delivered drinks that were not ordered (another table's drink order), and one dessert was completely forgotten (we had to flag someone down and it had not been made). My crème brulee dessert had the texture of scrambled eggs (with chunks), and I was told that it is just how they make it. I was offered a replacement dessert though, and ordered the chocolate fondant which was tasty. When paying, the server took the bill away without asking how we wanted to pay (split between 3 cards) and we had to wave at him to get him…"
1224,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"The Runaway bar was beautiful and had a great view of the planes! Highly recommend, service was great and fast, especially Vally! Bar food was also good. Nice outdoor patio seating and indoor overlooking the city / airport."
1225,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Excellent customer service. We had an unanticipated issue upon check in that was resolved quickly and professionally by Virander. Room and bed were very comfortable. As an airport hotel, we were quite satisfied with the facilities and service."
1226,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Great customer service at check in! Sohrab helped us immensely with directions around the terminal and hotel. The room was amazing and felt like a 5 star hotel. Will be back if I am ever in the area again.
1227,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"We stayed overnight after flying into Heathrow. The hotel was unbelievably quiet. It’s very close to aircraft taking off but there was no sound whatsoever. Our room was close to the elevator but again we didn’t hear a thing. The room was clean and modern with sockets for charging phones etc. The restaurant was very good, staff were friendly, prices were reasonable and the food was good. The hotel is linked through the parking garage to terminal 2. There is an underground walkway to terminal 3 and other terminals via train service. The price was a little higher than hotels outside the airport but it was very convenient."
1228,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Excellent location for transiting through Heathrow. Just a couple of minutes walk from terminal 2 and the rooftop bar gives a great view of the runway. Room was very good and Sohrab on the front desk made me feel very welcome. Wide range of choices for the breakfast.
1229,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,We were welcomed by Sohrab at reception who was really friendly and helpful. He explained where everything was and booked our early morning call. We would recommend this hotel to friends and family. It’s so close to the terminal with a 5 minute walk from the hotel.
1230,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"We stayed at this hotel and it was fabulous! Got off our flight at Terminal 2, grabbed our bags and loaded them on the trolly. Pushed it though the Car Park on the same level and a couple minutes later we were walking in the hotel. Check in was fast and we went to our room. The room was great and everything was new and spotless. Typical Hilton quality bed, large bathroom, flat screen, desk, etc. All excellent. We went to the bar/restaurant and both of us had an excellent meal. We went up to the 14th floor and had drinks and watched the planes take off and land. Next morning we pushed our bags back across the street, check in at United and were on our flight back to the U.S. No stress, slept well and no shuttles to deal with. Highly recommended."
1231,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Great bar with excellent views over the airport. The service from Vally was excellent. He was interested in hearing about our travel plans, and told us all about himself and family when asked. He prepared a table inside for a meal when asked. Thank you valley . Enjoy your holiday in Gos. 😄"
1232,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,We were on the Hilton Hotel just for one night. We had a dinner at the restaurant on de Hilton because we liked the menu. We eat Re bye and was delicious. Sobio served us and he was such nice and give us totally atencion.
1233,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"During my layover at Heathrow, I ate at Apron Restaurant, SURBHI the waitress that served the table was great! Excellent service from her, quickly to attend to us, always with a smile and willing to help with any request."
1234,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Great hotel with large rooms and everything you need. Stopped here for one night with the family and realized I don’t have enough outlet converters for the army of devices my kids carry. I want to the front desk and they ran out of them in the little kiosk, BUT Sohrab at the front desk gave me is personal converter. That is great service and I he went out of his way to help me out. Thank you Sohrab"
1235,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Vera and Tudor were attentive without being intrusive. Tudor greeted us and explained the ins and outs of the bar. When he became busy with other patrons, Vera stepped in seamlessly attended to our needs. Both Vera and Tudor were very pleasant and I will recommend this venue to others."
1236,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Excellent check in experience with Sohrab at the front desk. Clean rooms. Quiet despite being at airport. Was also given 2 waters without asking which was nice on a hot day. Easy trains into central London.
1237,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Our checkin with Sohrab was efficient, quick and friendly. Just what we needed after two long travel days. Our room is clean and well appointed with two chairs in the room which is always nice when two of us are traveling. Information on the hotel restaurant and where to get an Uber was clear and helpful."
1238,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"This is the first time we have stayed at this hotel, and the overall experience was excellent! Sohrab was helpful and attentive to our needs! He quickly checked us in! The room is clean and comfortable. The hotel is located across from terminal 2 with easy access."
1239,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Sohrab was our super friendly and helpful check- in guy who took care of all our requests! He was cheerful, cheeky, friendly and knowledgeable! After the long drive around the M25, the superior customer service was greatly appreciated!"
1240,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"The Heathrow Hilton Garden is conveniently located if you have a long layover at the airport. It is comfortable and clean. But the best thing about the hotel is Sohrab, the team member who checked us in. He was friendly, efficient, and helpful. Got us checked in quickly, explained our dining options, and made two weary travelers feel good. He is a credit to the Hilton Hotel chain."
1241,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Obliging and polite, as expected, however proactive, extremely helpful, and a considered/ intelligent response in dealing with my problem ( including creating and printing a map to get me to where I needed to go.)"
1242,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Savio and Luis and the entire team did a great job with our meal, I’ve been impressed with the hotel in general, the bar and this restaurant. Well made cocktails, I had the Cosmo. We had a ribeye, greek salad and desserts."
1243,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,The view and great service in Runway Bar from Vally the barman. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Amazing view across the airport and a beautiful setting sun. Ideal to walk through to Terminal 2. Would recommend it. Breakfast room service not available and would have made it 5 stars
1244,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"We had a great experience at this hotel! We arrived on overnight flight ftom the U.S. at 7:30am, and we were able to get an early check in around 9:00. We slept until about noon and it helped us acclimate to London time. Special thanks to Sohrab for his excellent customer service!!"
1245,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"Nishu in The Apron restaurant was pleasant and attentive. A friendly face at the end of a long day is very much appreciated. Thank you, Nishu! The food was not anything remarkable, but it tasted fine. I got there as the dinner service started and it was fairly quiet, that changed as I ate my meal. I recommend getting there early."
1246,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Had a fantastic nights sleep before my flight . The hotel staff go the extra mile to make your stay the best . Great atmosphere in the hotel . The buffet breakfast was writing home about . Such a choice and really sets you up for the day ahead
1247,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,"staff was very nice and helpful, especially virender at the front desk and faivos with my room service! definitely recommend for anyone with a flight in terminal two, it’s a direct walk straight into it !"
1248,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Thanks to Sohrab for getting me an early check-in - made all the difference after a very early start and two flights from Poland to LHR. Getting in early meant I could rest and be ready for a busy afternoon/evening of meetings.
1249,Hilton Garden Inn London Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3,Service at the front desk was top notch. Sohrab is very friendly and helpful. I had problems with pre check in and thought I had missed the good rooms to see Heathrow aircraft. Sohrab managed to find me a good room.
1250,The Kensington,"GORGEOUS hotel with stunning decor and the most comfortable bed, plus robes, and sparking rooms. I stayed a night but could of stayed a week. All of the staff working on 28/5 are so kind and helpful including Harvey. Breakfast was incredible too. Can’t wait to come back here."
1251,The Kensington,"A large group of 15 women were traveling g to London for a week with the matriarch of our family. Emiliano Del Pizzo was the concierge at this hotel and he was the most attentive professional Concierge I have ever met. My husband and I travel extensively and we always feel a concierge can be your best friend and enhance your experience. Emiliano did just that ! He went over and above with reservation assistance ,theatre recommendations , local knowledge and he created an atmosphere that was so very welcoming. His kind and warm nature is an asset to The Kensington Hotel. They should be very proud of him! Thank you Emiliano!!!"
1252,The Kensington,"We love the hotel, the staff, and the location. It has become our “go to” when in town. Great attention to you starts from walking in the door, through the registration process, and up to your room. Staff were consistently outgoing and helpful whether sorting out transportation or recommending day trips. Plenty of walkable dining options in the neighborhood. Two great museums just a few blocks away. And a tube station minutes away."
1253,The Kensington,"I travelled with my 3.5 year old and we had the best time staying at The Kensington. I’m a dual US/UK national and have stayed at many London hotels. For this trip, I was specifically looking for one that had great reviews for kids. While the hotel is lovely, what really made the experience great was the service. Kiddo got special treats, including a beautiful bear we named Popcorn. When he woke up hungry after midnight one night, the hotel helped us sort out a kid friendly middle of the night snack that he still talks about. The hotel also took great care of me. I’m deaf and for perhaps only the second time in my many years of travel, the hotel made a fire safety plan for me without my asking. They also told us about the National Rail strike and prevented us from nearly…"
1254,The Kensington,"We stayed in London last minute for my 30th birthday and I could not praise our experience - and the staff - at the Kensington more. Thomas (Guest Relations Manager) was so incredibly kind - with surprise cakes and champagne in the room for my birthday and such an attention to detail that we have already planned our next visit back! Harvey (concierge) was another stand out, delivering faultless service with his own personal flair, guaranteeing we were both in gales of laughter. It was truly a perfect hotel stay - the ameneties are exactly as you would expect (super comfy beds, pillows, lovely bathrooms etc) for such a lovely hotel but what really sets The Kensington Hotel apart is their attention to detail and dedication to personal service. Thank you all so much - we cannot…"
1255,The Kensington,"I have recently celebrated a milestone birthday at the Kensington Hotel with my Family and friends. I chose the hotel based on the reviews I had read, in particular regarding how family friendly it was, so my expectation bar was already set at a high level. Oh my goodness, how my expectations were exceeded! From the moment we arrived, until the end of our stay, the warmth and hospitality of every member of the Kensington Team we came into contact with was truly exceptional. We were all made to feel so welcome and special and it is a memory we will treasure for ever."
1256,The Kensington,"After the retirement protests in Paris consolidated our trip from 5 days in London and 5 days in Paris to 10 days in London, we were lucky enough to spend it in the Kensington. The staff here was outstanding at making our boys (6 and 8) feel at home, especially with the brilliant easter egg scavenger hunt they scheduled. Highly recommend the hotel and the team for an extended stay with your family."
1257,The Kensington,"We visited here today for an afternoon tea. The booking process was simple, I booked online and recieved an email to confirm. Any emails I sent were responded to promptly and were always helpful. We arrived and received a really friendly welcome, something which seems rare in London hotels these days. The interior was absolutely stunning, I was in awe! The seating was a little closer together but we managed and it wasn't overly busy. I was more worried about knocking the things off the table. Our waitor (apologies I didn't get his name) was incredibly helpful and charming. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the menu of the afternoon tea we were receiving. I don't recall booking an 'Around the world' afternoon tea, and I wouldn't have chosen an Indian themed one as we don't…"
1258,The Kensington,"This is a really welcoming and comfortable tradition London hotel in an excellent location. Public areas are really nicely done and it’s a great place to relax. The breakfast menu is excellent with a great range of options alongside the continental breakfast. (I had eggs Benedict and it was perfectly cooked and presented). Staff are so friendly and courteous, they seem really happy to be there and I cannot fault them."
1259,The Kensington,Stayed here for five nights with my husband and 16 month old. We have never experienced such genuine hospitality and kindness from hotel staff. Every single person who worked at the hotel was so kind and helpful. Special shout out to Maryam for setting up the baby crib and preparing such a special welcome package for my daughters first time in London. The details and extra effort really went a long way. Ray helped us get settled in the room and walked us through all the important details. He remembered my name throughout my entire stay. So impressive! Harvey was so helpful and kind. My husband was taking care of our daughter solo while I was at work during the day and Harvey always made himself available to be an extra set of hands for him which was always so appreciated. …
1260,The Kensington,"An amazing hotel, super nice and gentle staff and a beautiful place. We’ll surely come back again. They helped us with arranging everything etc. Food excellent and once again the staff was very friendly, helpful and nice."
1261,The Kensington,"Emiliano and his concierge team were incredible. They arranged travel from Gatwick to the hotel with a car seat for our 6 month old son as well as a nail appointment for my partner after she was chatting to one of the front of house staff about not knowing where to go and when we came back later that day Pavel had found multiple locations in walking distance with appointments available for that evening. We were blown away! .From the moment we arrived all the staff were personal, friendly and so professional. The kitchen steamed veggies so we didn’t have to interrupt the weening process on holiday. Food from both the restaurant and bar was lovely and reasonable priced for the quality. The House Keeping team, the waiting & bar staff are so knowledgable and Salvatore in the K Bar…"
1262,The Kensington,"Me and my friend just went in to have drinks at the hotel and so I cannot comment on the quality of the rooms. However I can say that our drinks were lovely, made promptly, and we enjoyed them sitting in their well decorated seating area. The staff there were all very friendly, one of the staff members called Gurcan was particularly helpful and enjoyable to be around, he was very open and easy to talk to. Overall the small visit was enjoyable and I’d suggest other people to visit too."
1263,The Kensington,"What a great hotel! It’s in a great location, 5 minute walk from the underground station, where 3 train lines are available. We had a slight problem with our room when we first arrived, but Dario Pani was accommodating in rectifying our issue. Our room was spacious, bed comfortable and shower stall wonderful. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The concierge, Emiliano, gave us a list of suggested restaurants. We made reservations and ate in 5 of these over the 8 nights of our stay. His suggestions were right on, the food was delicious! We would highly recommend this hotel and my husband and I would stay here again during our next visit to London!"
1264,The Kensington,"An exceptional hotel, great location and really well-appointed. Staff were excellent with the most amazing General.Manager a hotel could hope to have!!John McLean is the GM there who apparently is new to the hotel, but runs the hotel like he has been there for year's and so thoughtful. Our Little boy mentioned he loved Lego and when we git back from our day out, a present was delivered which was a lego set!! It made his stay! All staff just so lovely including the guys at concierge who were all so helpful. Harvey was lovely and couldn't do enough. Araman was super helpful and Silviu the doorman was very helpful and patient with our 4yr old son."
1265,The Kensington,Was wonderful night expending my time with my boyfriend. Was so relax and quit I feel like Iam home We had a good service from Bryan Carguaitongo Excellent

Very clean, friendly staff and opulent decor. Relaxing atmosphere. Just perfect. We will be returning. Highly recommend a visit."
1267,The Kensington,"This was our second stay at the Kensington, for a few days after the Easter Bank Holiday. the hotel is beautiful with excellent rooms, but it is the amazing staff who really make the trip - nothing is too much trouble and they are so friendly especially with our 6 year old son ! We will visit again soon."
1268,The Kensington,"I just had an amazing stay at The Kensington hotel. I’ve never had such an amazing experience with hotel staff. When I landed in the morning I called the hotel to ask if they can accommodate an early check in since I was tired. An hour later as I arrived at the hotel, Dario and Maryam had a room ready me. That was how my entire stay was. I ran the London marathon, and the staff sent me some sports drinks, snacks and a good luck card tue night before. I then ended up fracturing my ankle at the marathon and the staff cared for me like I was their own child. I truly felt at home and with family all weekend. I was blown away."
1269,The Kensington,Staff was always helpful and attentive. Decor is always on point. Loved the fresh flowers and artwork. Room was comfortable and beautifully decorated. Breakfast served was delicious and waiting staff impeccable. Highly recommend this hotel.
1270,The Kensington,"Cynthia R. Being a regular guest at The Kensington Hotel, for years by now, our multiple ""sejours"" in this hotel made of us feel part of this family. Each time we are overwhelmed with the kindness, the hospitality, wonderful service yet space and the joy of the team each time you cross any of them Each member of the Kensington Hotel team aims to make you feel at ease and longing to come back the soonest.

I am looking forward to the next time we get to stay at the hotel when we are next in London. thank you so much for a fabulous time"
1272,The Kensington,"The Kensington was one of the best Hotel experiences I have ever had. From Emiliano, Tom, Gurcan, Harvey, Ali, Luvien to Maryam to mention a few from the fabulous staff, my stay was elevated by their warm assistance to all my needs and much more with their friendliness. Each and everyone of them made me feel at home away from mine. I shall forever cherish the memories made during this particular trip. The room was impeccably clean, beautifully designed and had all the amenities I required as the location was perfect for my visit."
1273,The Kensington,"This was our third trip to The Kensington and we will return. The location in South Kensington is perfect. Close to wonderful shops, restaurants and only a block from a tube stop. The staff are wonderful. Everyone greeted us warmly by name each time we came or went from the property. They are always friendly and ready to help. The hotel is quiet, the rooms are comfortable and the food and drink are excellent. Highly recommended."
1274,The Kensington,"I have stayed at The Kensington many times over the past 10 years, and I can genuinely say it gets better every time. The warm and friendly welcome when you arrive sets the tone for the entire stay. All the staff are very efficient and attentive without being intrusive. The rooms are really comfortable, and the beds and linen guarantee a great nights sleep. It is obvious that a great detail of attention is given to maintaining the standard of accommodation and housekeeping. The turn down service in the evening is a real treat after a long day. Tom from Guest Relations goes above and beyond all expectations and his efforts and attentive nature make every guest feel like they are the most important guest in the hotel. Breakfast is a feast with a fantastic selection to…"
1275,The Kensington,"We had afternoon tea at The Kensington, the experience was amazing, the tea around the world is absolutely tasty and the entire service is superb, and we interacted every day with the doorman Silviu because we stayed around the corner and he was always so kind providing us access to taxis and references on places to visit. He was so attentive and polite. The hotel is very well located in the charming area of Kensington in London with easy access to all typical attractions in the City."
1276,The Kensington,"What a fantastic stay we've just had at The Kensington! I couldn't say enough about the helpfulness and kindness of the staff. Thomas is always at hand if you need anything. Bedrooms were spacious and very clean. Excellent food and great drinks menu too. Really couldn't rate it high enough, our stay in The Kensington made our trip to London all the more enjoyable, can't wait to go back."
1277,The Kensington,"The Kensington Hotel is our favorite hotel in London. We've stayed here many times over the years and always enjoy our experience. The staff is very friendly and the bar/restaurant is excellent! The rooms are clean and comfortable, and if you're staying for an extended period of time it's worth it to upgrade to a deluxe room for additional space. Our kids love that the hotel is within walking distance to great museums including The V&A, Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The hotel is in the heart of South Kensington and there are plenty of pubs and restaurants nearby (including Byron Burger which our son loves!) You can also easily walk to Hyde Park if it's a sunny day. My daughter brought her roller skates on the trip and enjoyed skating in the park. We were very…"
1278,The Kensington,"What a brilliant experience we had saying at this beautiful hotel. We arrived very early hoping just to drop our luggage and we’re very pleasantly surprised to be shown to our room. Every member of the team were so friendly, helpful and professional. Mario was very welcoming and helpful with directions. Arran rang ahead to our restaurant that we’d booked that evening to ensure we were looked after, and we were. We were upgraded to a wonderful studio suite and Sophia arranged for complimentary birthday cake and wine for my husband’s birthday. We met our family in the hotel bar and sampled fabulous cocktails. All made very welcome. Our room was so comfortable and we had the best night’s sleep in the comfiest bed. Breakfast was very good and again a relaxing, unhurried…"
1279,The Kensington,"I recently received a wonderful gift from my sister for my 60th birthday of a 3 night stay in the Kengston hotel. From arrival we were treated as VIPs. The hotel service was excellent,food A* and the staff were attentive to all our needs. Especially Tom and Harvey who went beyond by giving me a very special birthday celebration which I will never forget. I hope that the the GM takes note of his amazing staff from front of house, waiters bar staff, concessour and especially Harvey who for me is an asset to the Kensington and Doyle company. I will return to London as a result of my stay at this wonderful establishment and it's relaxing and welcoming vib. A*****"
1280,The Kensington,"We stayed at the Kensington for three nights (2 consecutive nights then one after a trip to Paris). Prior to arrival, I received an email from the hotel asking about our visit, our interests and the things my children enjoyed. I thought it was a nice touch but didn’t expect much beyond that. When we arrived, our room had two video game books and a Suduko book for my boys. They also added a large chocolate egg and more chocolates for them. My boys were so excited! Ali at reception was responsible for obtaining all these goodies and genuinely appeared happy to have done it. Harvey helped us with our luggage and immediately made a friend with my younger son by offering him a hot chocolate which he delivered while we waited. The room was beautifully appointed, comfortable,…"
1281,The Kensington,"80 Days Around the World Afternoon Tea A totally fabulous Afternoon Tea with sandwiches, cakes ,desserts and scones from around the world. Beautifully presented Staff especially Petronella so wonderfully attentive. A beautiful Afternoon Tea Thank you"
1282,The Kensington,"Absolutely perfect! We spent 6 nights at The Kensington Hotel with our family of 4 (two boys 8 and 10) for a spring break holiday. The staff is exceptional, the service is thoughtful, warm, and you don’t have to ask for anything twice. Thoughtful measures that you don’t find often in hotels anymore. The rooms are spacious, impeccably clean and very updated. The location of the hotel makes it easy to get anywhere around the city. To Tom and the entire staff of The Kensington, thank you for a memorable experience. We can’t wait to come back!"
1283,The Kensington,"Had a wonderful afternoon tea with my daughter on our trip to London. The theme was Around the World in 80 days. The service was wonderful, the food and tea were exceptional. We were not rushed and left full from the tea and goodies served. This is a must do on your trip to London."
1284,The Kensington,"Absolutely lovely from start to finish. The location is perfect, the space and decor is beautiful, and the staff is just lovely. The decor is very ornate and rich, but doesn’t feel stuffy or old fashioned. Everything feels fresh and the common areas have a lovely fragrance. The bed was super comfortable, the amenities were great, and I really enjoyed the breakfast."
1285,The Kensington,"To whom it may concern I would like to take this opportunity to share with you my experience of my brief stay (one day) at the Kensington to celebrate my birthday Firstly, on arrival, I was taken aback by the warm and welcoming greeting granted to my daughter and I, from the doormen to the ladies on reception, the young man who showed us to our room, and at dinner from our waiter who handled our meal so professionally with a smile on his face. Your staff are amazing… I so need to give a personal mention to your ‘Guest Experience Agent’ Mr. Thomas Keating! Wow! I can only imagine, what a tough job it must be at times to keep your guests happy, but it never showed in his face… Mr. Keating handled our stay with such tenderness and empathy taking our experience at the Kensington…"
1286,The Kensington,"Our family just returned from the most lovely spring break holiday. We booked The Kensington on part of the wonderful feedback we read on TripAdvisor and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Emiliano greeted us upon our arrival and honestly everything just went seamless from there. His kindness and expertise helped make our time in London even better then we planned. Every member of the staff is friendly, helpful, and kind. This hotel is absolutely exquisite. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the decor and attention to detail is gorgeous. Our breakfasts were delicious, and the afternoon tea was unique and exceptional. We love to walk and the location was perfect to do so as well as catch any other transportation. We fell in love with London during our time there…"
1287,The Kensington,"Excellent experience. From the comfort of the hotel, the great food and dining services, and the exceptional service by the Kensington team, my stay at the hotel exceeded expectations. It was my second time returning to the hotel, and the experience was great again. Special thank you for Emiliano at the concierge for all the attention and help."
1288,The Kensington,"As a return customers, we always feel really welcome at The Kensington. This time, Sofia had went out of her way to surprise us with special gifts for our kids - truly amazing. We will keep coming back - the kids will not want to go anywhere else now! :)"
1289,The Kensington,Really a fabulous hotel in the heart of London Would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the uk service was wonderful and staff so friendly. Room clean and comfortable. Well worth the price if you want to be treated well.
1290,The Kensington,I stopped in the Deluxe King Room and it provided everything I needed. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast is very nice. I have stayed here for several business trips and I will definitely be staying again.
1291,The Kensington,"We had an amazing afternoon tea. It was unique and a new twist. Rather than just sandwiches and scones, we had all kinds of pastries and tarts and other savoury things from different parts of the world. The service was outstanding. Abdul and his team had such attention to detail and were so attentive. The only thing I'd ask for would be a Christmas-themed afternoon tea so we could come back with the whole family!"
1292,The Kensington,So we visited yesterday for the wife's birthday. The service was impeccable and the surroundings were very plush and had a nice drawing room vibe. The service by all of the staff was second to none. I would like to particularly thank Abdul and Levento for their attention and care. Nothing was too much trouble despite two younger kids. The food was delicious and was a great homage to around the world flavours. We are already looking forward to going back.
1293,The Kensington,"This is a place to go on a special occasion, it’s not cheap but the ambiance is great and the food is lovely. We had a great waiter called Abdul who was very enthusiastic about what we were eating and keen to please!"
1294,The Kensington,"This is not the first time we been at the Kensington, on our previous visit we only enjoyed the restaurant and afternoon tea, the level was so satisfying that we decide to take a room this time for our regular visit in London. As soon we arrived we were welcome by Armand, his help during our stay was really important to us, he was able to make us comfortable instantly. My wife booked a superior room that was located at the first floor, the room unfortunately didn’t reflect our expectations. Really tiny toilette, very old decor. The light into wardrobe were truly annoying during the night, we tried to close it but the lock wasn’t working! During night we could hear music very loudly, we tried to reach the reception, the answer was that the music was coming from a “ CLUB” and they…"
1295,The Kensington,"Absolutely beautiful and spotlessly decorated room, warm and friendly staff and a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The staff couldn’t do enough to make sure we had everything we needed. The historic building is stunning. The cream tea was delicious, as was the breakfast. As we left, two log fires were burning and I really could have stayed all day. A perfect night away for busy parents."
1296,The Kensington,"Stayed for 2 nights for my birthday at The Kensington Hotel in London. I was made to feel very special. The hotel is beautiful and feels very comfortable, calm and welcoming. The furnishings and decor are very tasteful. Our room was lovely, large and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom. We had a terrace which was a real bonus as the weather was nice enough to sit outside on my actual birthday. Coffee machine, kettle and mini bar in room. All the staff were exceptional. Very friendly, welcoming, informative and helpful. Very easy to get around as only a few minutes walk to South Kensington station and many museums and Kensington Park. Breakfast was very relaxed and efficiently served. Would definitely recommend a stay there and can't wait to go and stay there…"
1297,The Kensington,"Stayed here a few years ago and it was perfect. This time not so perfect. As part of our Luxury Escapes package we were able to have an upgrade. The upgraded room although a king size was old, and depressing at the back of the hotel. We opted to go back to the queen room which was a slight improvement in regards to being a little more modern but so small, you could barely fit your luggage. The bathroom was ridiculously small. It was very expensive for the room size, and we were overcharged by Luxury Escapes, who wouldn’t honour the price difference. Hotel location is fantastic and the room was clean. Breakfast was fine, with lots of options. Wouldn’t stay here again for the price, considering the dated small room."
1298,The Kensington,"I had great lunch yesterday at The Kensington Hotel. Abdul helped me decide which food to order and the service overall was amazing. The Ceasar salad was really big and tasty which is great, as I was really hungry. Definitely, I will be back. Thank you Abdul for a lovely experience."
1299,The Kensington,I stayed regularly and because of the high standard of service I chose not to stay Elsewhere the service and staff are provided to a very high standard keep it up your standards across the hotel is very good and the hospitality areas are very good and comfortable
1300,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Great location and large clean room for business travel. Most importantly, the lobby desk staff was extremely welcoming and helpful in making recommendations for events, Also, the room service food was fantastic. The whole experience exceeded my expectations!"
1301,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Stayed here 2 nights. Great location & pleasant and helpful reception staff. Had two adjoining rooms with connecting door. Rooms were well clean , bed was comfortable and had all the frills including, kettle, tea cups, coffee machines. The only issue that I had was that both rooms were quite a small with a Queen Bed & sitting area in an approx 240 sq. foot area in each room. Staff at recption were very helpful with enquiries."
1302,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"What a wonderful place to stay! Staff were superb, room was fantastic. Hotel is right by Liverpool St Station, close to Spitalfields, Brick Lane and other attractions. We stayed for 3 days/2 nights to attend concerts in the O2, and wish we could have stayed longer. We will definitely be back! Not the cheapest hotel, but worth the money. Thoroughly recommended."
1303,Andaz London Liverpool Street,I came into the restaurant on a very hot June day having travelled on the underground. I was feeling very ill. The staff noticed and brought me iced water etc. in particular a big shout out to Shamim and Azusa! Food was excellent too! The Egg Royal was perfect.
1304,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Hotel was very pleasant and the staff were attentive and professional. The only thing was the air conditioning in the bedroom. Bearing in mind London had the hottest day of year so far, the room was way to hot and the air con did nothing. Made the night quite difficult. But, I do recommend the hotel. Just get a room where the air con is effective!"
1305,Andaz London Liverpool Street,Location was excellent and VERY POOR WIFI and everything else was average or below average. Breakfast buffet was cold and average just like their staff Room wasn’t clean till next evening. Mini bar was free but never go replenished. Asked for a toothpaste that never arrived. Most important the wifi was pathetic. It hardly ever worked For that price one expects better service
1306,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I was a whole week at the Andaz for a business trip. I can confirm that it made my trip so much better. The hotel is located at a top spot in London, were you have plenty of restaurants and shops pretty close and the Liverpool Street station at the corner. The restaurants at the hotel are really good. My colleagues and I enjoyed breakfast, lunch and some beers at three of the places in the hotel. The service was quick and effective and the people were really nice. The rooms are pretty comfortable and the space to work is adequate. The only thing that I had to point out is that the Wi-Fi at some points was a bit intermittent."
1307,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"The location was incredible convenient and I would absolutely stay here again. The staff was wonderful and always accommodating. The hotel is just a few steps from Liverpool St Station which has multiple underground lines and national rail lines running through it so transportation was a breeze. The rooms are a bit dark in the closet area and the bathroom in our room was a bit on the cramped side, but I would return regardless because of how convenient I found the location."
1308,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I would like to say what a wonderful time we had at this beautiful hotel over the weekend. We were only 1 night and wished we had booked more. I would especially like to thank Zaema for her happy, friendly, helpful manner. She is a credit to you and your team. Nothing was too much trouble helping with tube instructions and timings and the hand written note left in our room was an especially lovely touch."
1309,Andaz London Liverpool Street,Do not stay!!!! They took a £50 authorised fee then took a further £154 without my permission I brought this up and said it was a mistake and would be back in my account today. It was not. Constantly on the phone took 8 days They lie and say it was authoritarian fee which is wasn’t They say I declined to show evidence which I showed proof on to their online account. They are doing this to how many people??? I really would stay clear
1310,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I have stayed at this hotel a few times for work trips. On my current visit, the wifi signal in my room is extremely poor. I’m getting a 1-5mbps speed and constant drops. I was given access to a special network, which is also not great. This hotel caters to business travelers; there is no excuse for not ensuring top-notch internet connectivity. When I tried to call the front desk, I had to call multiple times and it took over 10 minutes to get someone to answer. The hotel is clearly understaffed. For the price charged, all of these issues are unacceptable."
1311,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I often stay at the Andaz in London because it is right next to the Liverpool Street train station, making it easy to get anywhere in town. The neighborhood also has some fun places to go. The rooms are nice and the service and breakfast are very good."
1312,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"We stayed 2 nights in May and had a wonderful experience- the hotel’s decor is quite unique. Location is next to Liverpool Street Station, very convenient. Enjoyed the early checkin, complimentary HH and mini bar. As always the service was outstanding, especially Ali who helped me with another Hyatt reservation that had been canceled. We will definitely be back!"
1313,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I have never stayed in East London, so this my first time at the hotel and in the neighborhood. Situated in the former Great Eastern Hotel, the Andaz mixes contemporary decor with the old classic architecture. The staff here is exceptional. The front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming (thanks, Venice!), and we were offered a glass of champagne at check-in. Our king room was spacious by London standards. Even though there was a busy street outside, the windows were double paned so that it was quiet in the room. I also liked the Nespresso machine and complimentary mini bar, with chips, cookies, water, juices and soft drinks. The hotel Wi-Fi is free. The bathroom had a convenient shelf to place one's toiletries and there was a heated towel rack, with large absorbent…"
1314,Andaz London Liverpool Street,This is a fantastic Boutique hotel. The receptionist Ms. Zaema is outstanding. Her care and attention to me and my wife was beyond excellent. She remembers here guests and goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Because of her we will always choose Andaz for our stays in London. Ms. Zaema is a credit to Andaz. 🙏
1315,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Excellent hotel with excellent service. I've stayed many times and like it so much, that I now use it as my 'go to' place to stay in The City. Fantastic interior that provides a good variety of different places to eat/drink/relax, all in a high quality but unfussy manner. Rooms are spotless, which matters. And the service is, as I mentioned, excellent. Thank you Zaema (reception) .... you provide a great example to all. I'll be back :)"
1316,Andaz London Liverpool Street,Having stayed in many hotels in London this is our new favourite. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. Location is excellent too. Staff were welcoming and very pleasant. Excellent check in with drinks.
1317,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I arrived at 1.30 to leave my bag, having checked in online, and to double-check that I was allocated a quiet, high floor room. I received assurance that I had a 6th floor room and my bag would be in it by the time I returned from meetings. So far so good….though nothing like the personal welcome we have enjoyed at other Andaz hotels. I returned at 8.30 and received the key for a 2nd floor room, on the front corner of the busy Bishopsgate road! No warm welcome and definitely no welcoming drink! Despite my complaints, I was reassured the room was an upgrade, and the hotel was full so - tough! All I wanted was a quiet room, but no chance. Only apologies….. and Sirens, traffic noise all night and banging from the interconnected room next door. In the room, my bag was nowhere to…"
1318,Andaz London Liverpool Street,Dropping off our college age son for a summer internship in London. Our room wasn’t ready upon our arrival but Luca was very gracious in taking care of us during our wait. The property is historic but enjoys a very modern interior finish. Food and service at the hotel and restaurants were top notch. Would definitely stay there again.
1319,Andaz London Liverpool Street,Just a couple of drinks but beautifully served by Ayisha..a credit to your company ...we have been here a few times and always great service but Ayisha was so helpful suggesting cocktails and very quick service
1320,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I just completed a recent stay at the Andaz hotel on Liverpool Street for a 6 day business trip. Overall, I loved the hotels location (I just took the Elizabeth line from LHR to LIverpool Street in 1 hour). The hotel is very centrally located to many parts of London and has Shoreditch at it's back drop. Additionally, the service at the hotel was impeccable from check-in to housekeeping to maintenance everything worked perfectly. For the two times I ate breakfast at the hotel buffet, it was great (good selection). The rooms in the hotel were very large and had great sound proofing (I couldn't hear any of the traffic outside despite facing Liverpool Street). The gym at the hotel was very large and well equpit with free weights, squat racks, cardio machines (bikes, rowers,…"
1321,Andaz London Liverpool Street,The hotel is in an excellent location. Ideal for getting anywhere. The hotel itself is very bright and cherry and the staff were very friendly and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The room itself was very comfortable and the bed was amazing.
1322,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I recently stayed at Andaz Liverpool London and was thoroughly impressed with their check-in process, which was swift and efficient. The hotel's amenities and services were top-notch, providing a luxurious and comfortable experience. However, what truly stood out was the exceptional service provided by the guest service coordinator. Their attention to detail and genuine warmth made my stay truly memorable. Highly recommended for a remarkable hotel experience."
1323,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Great location and great service! Definitely made our visit to London more enjoyable. The stuff is friendly, responsive and very supportive, Room is clean and comfy. We would love to come back and recommend to our friends and family."
1324,Andaz London Liverpool Street,This was a great experience to stay at Andaz. Before you even check in they offer you a glass of Prosecco and then they all are very kind and helpful. The hotel is beautiful and very comfortable. I’d love to come back. The breakfast buffe was super fresh and rich with everything you can want.
1325,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Loved our stay at the Andaz London. Wonderful top notch upgraded hotel with great staff. Our room was spacious with free mini bar. Lobby is eclectic and hotel is a fun overall experience. The Andaz is located above the Liverpool train station, despite its railway history the beautiful and significant modern upgrades are great, but really not apparent from the outside, the traditional red brick facade hasn’t changed much since 1800’s. The Eastway Brasserie restaurant for breakfast is a delight. The Andaz is within walking distance of cool pubs and cafes, vintage clothing boutiques and high end shopping, plus the eclectic art/shopping of Brick Lane. Lastly, the central Liverpool station and the new Elizabeth line are minutes away featuring fast access everywhere and direct LHR…"
1326,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I am astonished that this hotel is billed as a 5 star hotel. At most it warrants a 3 star rating. I've experienced better hotel lobby's at Best Western, seen cleaner hallway floors at Holiday Inn Express hotels, and stayed in better standard rooms at Best Western. All of those hotels I'd bill as 3 star hotels. In contrast the 5 star big name hotels I've stayed in such as the Four Seasons Hong Kong, Langham Huntington, Pasadena, JW Marriott Cancun, Grand Hotel Stockholm were truly 5 star. The service was impeccable. The hotel was immaculate in every sense. The lobbies were grand. All rooms including their standard rooms were exquisite. The same for the boutique hotels I've stayed such as the Mansion on Forsyth Park- Savannah, Union Station Nashville Yards, The Charleston Place,…"
1327,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"My son studied in London for the semester and stayed at the andaz before loving into his apartment. His experience was so good, I booked for my visit. I was not disappointed! The Liverpool Street location is very convenient, the restaurant choices were many and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I hope to visit again!"
1328,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"The Andaz London Liverpool Street has an incredible staff, an interesting, funky & very clean decor and a great location-two doors down from the tube & district train stop! The East End has a fascinating history; there are two great breakfast options, a beautiful bar & a Japanese restaurant. You can’t go wrong!"
1329,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"We usually stay near Mayfair but decided to give this hotel a try. It’s located next to the Liverpool tube stop so very convenient location to get around London via public transportation. There are many restaurants & shops within walking distance from the hotel. We found the bathroom to be a bit small but overall we enjoyed our stay. Complimentary minibar is offered with non-alcoholic drinks, coffee & snacks"
1330,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Room was lovely, clean, and comfortable. I made the mistake of ordering room service the second night and got very ill from the food. On the morning of check out we tried to get breakfast at Rakes but was told there was no chef. I had stayed at other Andaz properties before which set a high bar of expectation and this is very disappointing."
1331,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Andaz liverpool street was the best experience. Jason and all of the staff made sure we felt welcomed and comfortable. Check-in was seamless, the rooms were top-notch clean, and the environment was perfect. The location and the onsite restaurants were also nice as well. Andaz liverpool street was also very accomodating to my 2 year old. Thank you for making my trip and birthday a very memorable experience."
1332,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"What a beautiful stay we had, the staff could not do enough for you. A huge thank you Lorraine who was extremely helpful and accommodating and so bright and cheerful... you really did make out stay perfect. The management are professional and are totally on the ball with running the hotel. The rooms were clean and airy with everything you need like an iron, hair drier and shower condiments. The cocktails in Rakes were to die, thank you to Aurelia & Lorraine for giving us a complimentary voucher to spend to celebrate our anniversary. If you are thinking of staying at this hotel, do it .. do not hesitate! Its stunning and oozes class. A beautiful boutique styled hotel in the heart of the city. Thank you, we will be back in a hurry!"
1333,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Lovely hotel with a couple of good bars, welcoming Reception (including a welcome drink), great room, comfortable bed, good toiletries etc. Also loved the “wine hour” which included canapés 6-7pm. Will definitely return."
1334,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Been to London 3 times in the past year and Andaz is by far my favorite hotel. Perfect location, hospitality is top notch, the rooms are big with great views and let’s not forget about the gym and steam room! The staff greet you with a glass of champagne and Rakes is delicious! Couldn’t recommend the hotel more, it’s a must!"
1335,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"This has got to be one of Hyatts gems in London! So conveniently placed next to Liverpool Street Station and central to almost every part of London. Taking the tube, bus and walking was so convenient and easy to navigate from Andaz. The rooms are clean and service is daily to keep things fresh. The team members are friendly and very helpful. Was really pleased with having chosen to stay at Andaz!"
1336,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Great hotel. Super conveniently located at the Liverpool St station which has a direct Elizabeth line train to LHR and many other underground lines. Additionally the hotel offers 4 different restaurant options. We tried two, Rakes and East Way Brasserie for breakfast, which were both outstanding. The only suggestion for improvement is that windows in the rooms should be made soundproof as we did hear a little bit of street noise."
1337,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I stayed here the night before, and the night of my brothers wedding. The room was very comfortable. Nice soft pillows. And lots of space to get ready for the wedding. The bathroom was nice and had all the products you could wish for. We went and got breakfast from Cafe Nero in the Station nearby. And had drinks in the Andaz hotel bar, in the early evening. The bar was comfortable, and they serve food to."
1338,Andaz London Liverpool Street,From check in to checkout our experience at the Andaz was amazing. The hotel is modern and beautiful and the people who work there are courteous and top class. We got to the hotel early (10 AM) and they stored our luggage while the room was getting ready and took the bags to the room so we just had to get our keys and go up. The pub on premise is very nice with a good selection of drinks and pub food. I would recommend this hotel to others.
1339,Andaz London Liverpool Street,The Andaz was perfect for our little London Getaway. It was our first time in the city and it was ideal to use as a base to get around the city as Liverpool Street station is so well connected. The front reception team were superb and always so helpful with the area. Can’t wait to come Back!
1340,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Me and my wife travelled to London for the Marathon. We only stay in Hyatt Properties. This hotel is right next to the Liverpool Street Tube Station. From there, you can get to anywhere in the city. The restaurant has 4 restaurants. We ate in 3 out of the 4. All were good. The front desk staff were extremely nice and greeted us every time we entered the property. Rooms were fine. It had a great Fitness Center with Steam Room. The hotel is divided into two different sections, a modern section and a very old section which is beautiful, with a spiraling staircase. There is a daily free wine hour from 1800 - 1900 hours. I would recommend this hotel."
1341,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Excellent breakfast, fabulous sushi spot, lovely reception. Great location- we walked so much to all the sites from here. Very safe, access to metro next door, and very quiet rooms. Really loved the service and the hotel. Fully equipped (and busy) gym, too. Be prepared for long hallways. Exceptional turndown and housekeeping services- spotless room. Go for an upgrade and I like the 3rd floor with high ceilings, corner rooms are a plus."
1342,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"The Andez hotel in London is absolutely beautiful! The lobby is great and definitely makes you feel like you're in a 5-star hotel. The location is perfect, too - it isn't too crowded of an area, and it's right next to the train station, which makes traveling in/around the city super easy. It's also really easy to get a cab from the hotel (without reserving one). The staff is over-the-top WONDERFUL! They were so accommodating while we were there - bringing us coffee, giving us personalized recommendations on things to do and places to go/eat nearby, and they brought us a delicious dessert and hand-written card (we were there celebrating our honeymoon). The room is beautiful, the bed is super comfy (and I am really picky about hotel beds and bedding!), there's plenty of storage…"
1343,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"It was my first time at a Andaz property and what a pleasure! The staff (Jason and Luca, specifically) was amazing and the rooms were gorgeous. It was my 2 year old daughter's first time as a hotel guest and she loved it too! I'm not normally one to notice lighting, but it was clear someone was very intentional about how to light your hotel rooms - they were so warm and comfortable. The thoughtful touches on this hotel were evident. The breakfast buffet was also the best! As an advisor with Fora Travel, I will definitely be recommending this property."
1344,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I had not been to the Andaz before but I certainly will be back. The staff on the front desk were great, no question was too great for them. The bed was the comfiest I have slept on in a long time and I travel quite regularly. I didn’t try the breakfast but I saw the buffet and it looks incredible."
1345,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"The staff is what makes this hotel as good as it is. Everyone is pleasant, friendly and extremely attentive. The moment I walked into the hotel I felt I was amongst people who had my comfort and happiness foremost in everything they did."
1346,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"I took my mum here for her birthday. The staff were great. Check in was easy and the staff were very welcoming. Room was lovely, clean and spacious. TV absolutely huge. Staff member knocked on the door with a birthday cake for my Mum and some posh chocolates. We went out for the evening and upon our return we found a cute box of sweets and a birthday note for my Mum. We were impressed and very appreciative. Breakfast was 10/10. Good quality food, English breakfast, fruit, pancakes, cheese, hams, nice variety of bread. Even iced doughnuts and muffins. We couldn't fault the place and my mum thoroughly enjoyed her stay for her birthday. Highly recommend. Oh and the hotel was beautiful too. Lovely building, decor, very spotless and I liked the artwork. ☆☆☆☆☆"
1347,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"Stunning hotel right next to the station; the interior, with its multitude of difference places and styles is a wonderful place to relax, and soak in the different vibes. The staff, to a person, are excellent...attentive, helpful, and very welcoming."
1348,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"The hotel has a perfect location. The price is too high compared to the overall value you get. With same price you can have a more sophisticated and beautiful hotel located in the center of London. If you need an hotel close to Liverpool Street station, Andaz is perfect"
1349,Andaz London Liverpool Street,"We haven't previously stayed in this area in London, on this occasion we were attending a Coffee Show on Brick Lane. The Andaz exceeded all our expectations, easy to get to from Euston, we found this grand building conveniently situated by Liverpool Street Station. This Hotel simply just kept giving and giving, the rooms were spacious and immaculately clean, the choice of Bars, the breakfast, the architecture, the interior design, the history all come together to give you a unique, quirky, individual experience which is fitting for this area of London."
1350,The Resident Victoria,Was a great place to stay and very friendly staff. It was our anniversary and they went above and beyond to make it special for us. Answered all our questions about the area. Easy to get to all the main attractions.
1351,The Resident Victoria,"Just returned from a 5 night stay! The hotel is in an amazing location. Minutes walking from Buckingham Palace and within walking distance to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, Big Ben and St James Palace. No restaurant but a cute little kitchenette and fridge do the job! I would not hesitate to stay here again. We were welcomed with decorations and champagne for our anniversary. Very appreciated and lovely staff."
1352,The Resident Victoria,"The Resident Victoria is a hidden away little gem. Excellent staff, fabulous rooms and superb location. We could not have asked for anything more. We have told all our friends and family about this little find and we will definitely be visiting again."
1353,The Resident Victoria,"We enjoyed staying here! The hotel was nice and quiet. I never heard our neighbors. The front desk staff was eager to help and answer questions. We felt safe walking to and from the hotel at night. It smelled pleasant and was very clean. We were celebrating our Anniversary and they welcomed us with chocolates and champagne in our room. The only ""issue"", (if you could call it that) was that we left one of our keys in the ""light switch"" and the maid took it. The front desk replaced the key for us."
1354,The Resident Victoria,"Angry employee at the front desk, refused to admit that my room was prepaid with a corporate card through our travel agent; I had to pay my room which had already been paid. I tried to explain this to the person in charge, to no avail. And as a revenge she gave me a room (should I really call it a room, it doesn't deserve to be called this) down in the basement, where literally, the walls vibrated every minute whenever a tube train arrived at the station nearby; a true nightmare, (no pun intended). Even with earplugs I had a terrible night, checked out early in the morning. And as a cherry on the cake, the staff at the desk launched a sarcastic 'have a nice day' when I left the hotel at the wee hours of the morning. Clearly this hotel is managed by low level employees, and the…"
1355,The Resident Victoria,"Spent 2 nights in a double and king room as a family group with adult kids. Loved the hotel. Everything spotless, and so quiet for a central London location. Rooms a decent size and the little kitchenette is a nice addition, though the fridge is tiny. We ordered Uber Eats to the lobby which worked fine. Easy walking distance to the sights of central London. Would come back without hesitation."
1356,The Resident Victoria,"We love the location of this hotel, it was close to restaurants and transportation! And if you are interested in Buckingham palace, you are at walk-in distance. Staff was very attentive and accommodating! We just stay one night but it was wonderful!"
1357,The Resident Victoria,"Stayed here when visiting family. It’s a really great location near Victoria and lots of amenities within walking distance. The staff are really friendly and happy to help. We had a king room, it was decorated nicely and the bed was comfortable. Although the room was a little on the small side and as it’s fairly costly per night, probably wouldn’t stay again."
1358,The Resident Victoria,"This was perfectly situated for access to Victoria Station and the tube and an easy walk to Cardinal Walk, where there were plenty of stores and restaurants and open space. The rooms were a little small but nevertheless well equipped and clean and comfortable."
1359,The Resident Victoria,"This was a real gem of a hotel. Thoughtfully appointed room with a great mini kitchen, easy access to transportation and just a few minutes walk to restaurants and shops in the area. Easy and quick access to the fairly quiet street, and really peaceful at night. Great wifi and the staff were helpful and kind."
1360,The Resident Victoria,Excellent location👍 Exceptional staff 👍 Very clean and tidy rooms👍 Reasonable price👍 Proper hairdryer in the room(loved it!)👍Small kitchen with all you would need on the short stay. Would recommend to friends and family and definitely will be back soon👍👍👍
1361,The Resident Victoria,"Very close to Buckingham Palace & Victoria Station, easy reach of restaurants & bars. The rooms were very clean and well appointed. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. Would have been nice to have an on-site restaurant for breakfast"
1362,The Resident Victoria,"The understated calm and relaxed atmosphere was perfect , everything was just as we wanted without any fuss , the positioning of the hotel was so useful and we could walk to all the places we needed plus some excellent pubs and food places and shops right on the doorstep - loved it!"
1363,The Resident Victoria,"A perfect combination of location, hospitality, cleanliness, and comfort, this hotel is on a quiet corner just next to Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews. I especially enjoyed the proximity to a small, plaza where I could grab a quick coffee or pick up a few groceries. Victoria Station is about a five-minute walk, with connections to anywhere in London and beyond. The staff was helpful and accessible without being intrusive. The small lobby has the feel of a boutique hotel, and the rooms were clean, tastefully decorated, and well-appointed. They are small, as would be expected. The shower is walk-in, and mine had a large, rain-type shower head along with a hand-held wand. The mini-kitchen was behind bifold doors. In short, I had a wonderful stay and felt safe and…"
1364,The Resident Victoria,"This chic but unassuming little hotel on a narrow dead end alley in central London (a block from Buckingham Palace) was an absolute godsend. This is not a showy hotel with a big lobby, bar, restaurant, gym, or other resort-like amenities. It is, instead, stylish, comfortable, and extremely pragmatic. Our room was whisper quiet, the quietest we’ve ever experienced in a city; the bed was comfortable and large; the seating area was ample and convenient; and—best of all—they’ll stick your fridge and pantry with whatever groceries you select from The Waitrose website. This allowed us to eat a healthy, quick breakfast each morning in our room before heading out on foot or by can for the day. Staff and housekeeping were amazing, and we felt very taken care of there. Highly recommended."
1365,The Resident Victoria,"We planned a 25th anniversary trip which started which started in London. We chose a Resident hotel based on reviews and we were not disappointed. I mentioned ahead that it was our 25th anniversary and we were greeted in our room with balloons, champagne and chocolate! Would definitely return and recommend."
1366,The Resident Victoria,"The boutique hotel offered superb service!! In addition, Resident Victoria is located within walking distance of significant landmarks and restaurants! I highly recommend the hotel. I will be returning the next time I'm in London!"
1367,The Resident Victoria,"The front desk staff at the Resident Victoria in London were always friendly. Always caring and helpful. Can’t say enough good about them. Truly wonderful. Each day we would ask their advice on restaurants, travel means, sight seeing, and each day they would provide us with the most helpful advice. Rooms were very well equipped, comfortable and immaculately clean. The Nespresso machine was a welcome bonus. Location was handy to shopping and restaurants. Easy to access transportation from there. If I had only one drawback, it would be that the rooms are quite small by North American standards, but we managed just fine. Rooms are quite sound proof as well which is so nice for a good nights sleep. I would recommend this hotel to my friends. Well done the Resident!"
1368,The Resident Victoria,"It is the second time we have stayed at The Resident Victoria, besides being in an excellent location, the accommodations are quite good and the personnel is outstanding. Particularly Jason who is always ready to help and to share a joke."
1369,The Resident Victoria,"This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. The front desk staff is amazing. From a flawless check in and check out to providing recommendations, directions, etc., they were always pleasant, helpful, and sometimes humorous. They were more than willing to go above and beyond. I spent 6 nights in a superior room and it was incredibly comfortable. Roomy with a fridge, microwave, Nespresso machine and kettle, it was perfect. The bed and pillows were way above standard hotel grade bedding. High points too for very, very good WiFi as well. The hotel and its surrounding area are also amazingly quiet so there were no late night/early morning disruptions. Finally, it also in a perfect location. Around the corner from Buckingham Palace, it's an easy walk to St. James Park, Big…"
1370,The Resident Victoria,"My Husband & I stayed 6 days. FABULOUS staff (Jason &Andreea very helpful and kind. Comfortable rooms w/ fridge, coffee & tea service. Great area:1 block from Buckingham Palace, Le Signore cafe right around corner for reasonable breakfast or panini and cappuccino (say hello to Manuele & Anna for Katherina) Walking distance to Victoria Train Station, Hop-on-Buses, shopping (Marks& Spencer and other stores). Price is good value. Like a home away from home. Had a fabulous time here."
1371,The Resident Victoria,This hotel is located in the center of tourist attractions but on the quiet street which helps a lot to have a good night sleep. Front desk people are very attentive and pleasant. Property is very well maintained and very clean.
1372,The Resident Victoria,"The hotel is less than five minute walk to palace and the area can be checked on google maps for local venues for food and drink. Shopping for a range of good and services can be achieved at the Cardinal Walk retail area with five minutes walk. The Phoenix Pub does a reasonable range of food and Browns in Cardinal Walk does a great meal and not too pricey for London. If you have some time to kill and the weather is okay, St James Park has enough friendly wildlife and features and a large cafe for food and drink."
1373,The Resident Victoria,Stayed at the Resident Victoria for the Coronation and it was perfect! It was so close to Buckingham Palace along with pubs close by - the location could not have been better. The hotel was clean and everyone so kind. I would highly recommend staying here!
1374,The Resident Victoria,Lovely hotel with lovely staff. Will definitely be back. We came up for a special event and the hotel stay added very nicely to it. Well equipped room. Quiet location and so close to everything we wanted and needed with do much more around.
1375,The Resident Victoria,This was our 3rd stay in this lovely hotel. The staff are all very friendly & helpful. The location is excellent & although we were there for the busy Coronation weekend the room was very quiet. We will be back!
1376,The Resident Victoria,"Excellent friendly staff, very nice room conveniently located.easily accessible to restaurants, the palace and transit to get around the city. Would recommend this hotel to my family and friends. Great location"
1377,The Resident Victoria,"Lovely hotel, perfect location for site seeing and getting about. Also close to tube and rail and very convenient for eateries. The room was great and the kitchen area was very useful. Staff couldn’t do enough for you"
1378,The Resident Victoria,"Had the most wonderful stay thanks to the brilliant staff making the family celebration so special, the quiet yet well positioned location. This was our 2nd stay and for sure it will not be our last. Thanks Jason for helping us create memories"
1379,The Resident Victoria,"Amazing stay, friendly staff, amazing location. Loved the quiet feel. Room was small but had everything we needed and was very clean. Loved the mini kitchen with the nespresso maker and little fridge. It was perfect, can’t wait to come back"
1380,The Resident Victoria,"One of the best experiences I have had with a stay! Definitely would recommend staying here to anyone! Great location, steps away from Buckingham Palace! Pleasant walk to many historical sites in the city."
1381,The Resident Victoria,"Service and location! The location cannot be beat as the website states—you are just a few blocks away from Buckingham Palace, St. James Park, etc. The room was absolutely spotless and had a lovely kitchenette area with microwave, refrigerator, sink and tea/coffee service. Bed was very comfortable and one of the best shower water pressures ever! Front desk was so helpful arranging transportation to airport after researching tube delays. Specific side note: our daughters notified the hotel of my husband’s milestone (60th) birthday. We arrived with beautiful balloons, cake and even champagne from the hotel. In a city filled with beautiful hotels, the Resident Victoria made us feel so special. We could not recommend more highly!"
1382,The Resident Victoria,Fabulous place to stay. Close to Victoria Station and our room was lovely. Took the Heathrow express to Paddington station and then a cab to the Resident. Just happened on the Changing of The Guard..amazing!
1383,The Resident Victoria,"This was a really fantastic hotel. Great staff, a very nice room and wonderful bathroom. The room was comfortable and clean and very nicely tidy up every day. Very easy to get to many sites in London and I would definitely come and stay again."
1384,The Resident Victoria,My husband and I stayed a couple of nights at the Resident Victoria and were pleasantly surprised by the great location and friendly staff. I booked the slightly larger King room and it was perfect for us. I enjoyed the Nespresso machine in our room and also having the filtered water at the sink. This was a great value for the price!
1385,The Resident Victoria,"This was a gem of a boutique hotel. Great service, nice room, and very conveniently located. I highly recommend. The staff were very responsive and the room was well maintained. There was a problem with the shower draining and maintenance took care of it right away. Everyone was really friendly. There was a small kitchenette area with a fridge and Nespresso machine, so I was able to enjoy breakfast each morning. There are a variety of shops and restaurants in the area, and Victoria Station isnright around the corner. Overall a great stay!"
1386,The Resident Victoria,"First off all, highly recommend staying in Victoria for your trip to London. It’s quiet, safe, and had lots of great food options. Also an easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament, etc. The hotel specifically was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the rooms were very comfortable."
1387,The Resident Victoria,"Excellent location for walking. Restaurants and an M & S store in close proximity. The room and bathroom are a nice size and the kitchenette is a nice addition. Jason, the reception manager, was very helpful and personable. He helped us with all questions and gave us suggestions for our transport from the hotel to the dock. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
1388,The Resident Victoria,"Yes, the room is named “Small Double” but it was beyond my comprehension that a hotel room designed for two people could be this small…with each of us having a checked bag, a carry on bag and a personal item, we barely had room to move. The room had very poor lighting. There are also no bedside tables due to the tiny room size so there is no place to put glasses, books, breathing machines, alarm clocks, etc by the bed. At best this room should be sold as a single with just a twin bed in it."
1389,The Resident Victoria,"Excellent location, close to Buckingham Palace, great restaurants and all forms of transportation. Upon arrival I was assigned a room in the basement. Nothing on the website indicated my room would be in the basement. The staff quickly moved my room to the fourth floor. My room was not properly cleaned, used wine glasses from the lobby as well as glasses I used in the room were not replaced."
1390,The Resident Victoria,"As close as you can get to the Buckingham Palace. Public transportation in short distance, many shopping an food possibilities nearby. Really nice Hotel, very clean and with super friendly personal!!!"
1391,The Resident Victoria,"A clean and friendly hotel. Good resturants in the neighbourhood; Franco Manca, Pizza Pilgrims. Very close to Buckingham palace. Westminister Abbey, London Eye and many other attractions within walking distance."
1392,The Resident Victoria,I loved my stay here! It was so convenient for walking to so many points of interest. It was nice to be able to come back to my cozy room to rest. Everybody on staff there was helpful and friendly. I would definitely return here for another stay!
1393,The Resident Victoria,Room was a little small. Traveled with a group and booked 3 rooms (all at same rate) and ours was much smaller than the other two. The service was excellent. The location was walking distance to many attractions. There were plenty of places for dining nearby.
1394,The Resident Victoria,Great hotel in a wonderful location. Just a short walk to our theatre - or a short trip on the tube. Transport links are great in this area. Lots of eateries around and a bit of shopping too. Hotel extremely welcoming and a few added extras for our trip made it even more special. Really close to the palace for a bit of sightseeing. No restaurant and we didn't use room service but the drinks prices looked really reasonable for a central London hotel. Could not fault the hotel or the welcome we received. Would definitely stay again.
1395,The Resident Victoria,"Stayed at The Resident Victoria in Jan 2023 and was very impressed. Clean hotel, comfortable and felt safe in the centre of London. Great location, minutes from Buckingham Palace. We watched a show at The Other Palace theatre and this was literally next door. The staff at the hotel are truly wonderful. All very polite, chatty and customer service was top quality. It was my daughter’s birthday and they provided complimentary balloons in the room, a birthday cake, Prosecco (for me) and a choice of soft drinks or water for her. They also gave her a birthday card which was very cute and had a personalised drawing in it. I felt that the team at the hotel made a really special effort and it was greatly appreciated. I cannot thank them enough for this. I would 100% stay here again…"
1396,The Resident Victoria,"Great location, clean modern accommodation and Super friendly staff especially Raquel on reception. Would for sure choose to stay again. The room was really nice spacious with a very comfortable bed all spotlessly clean"
1397,The Resident Victoria,"Stayed here for one night on a flying visit to town. Arrived super early and dropped bags without any trouble, check in was seamless when we arrived later, and as we checked out we were asked if we wanted to leave luggage for the day. Room was lovely, modern, and clean - very quiet corridor even though the hotel felt quite busy. I spend 60+ nights a year in hotels, and this was a good stay. Would return the next time I'm in town"
1398,The Resident Victoria,"Really enjoyed our stay at the resident Victoria. The women at the front desk were super kind and accommodating. The hotel is in such a central location close/walkable to many of londons most famous attractions- but the hotel is tucked away on a side street so it’s quiet and Quiant! Not loud when sleeping. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was clean. Would def stay here again!"
1399,The Resident Victoria,"Friendly staff, great room, nice lounge and bar area. This boreal is near many places of interest for first time londoners. If you want to pick something up from a local grocery, make sure you go early. Everything closes down early in this area"
1400,"The Langham, London","My wife and I recently spent three nights at the Langham London. The hotel is in a great location near Regent Park and just a short walk from the Oxford Circus tube station. Our room was excellent. The staff are exceptional, unfailingly courteous and immediately responsive. I would highly recommend the Langham to colleagues, friends and family. And I strongly suggest a room with access to the Club for breakfast and other amenities throughout the day. It will make the Langham your new favorite hotel."
1401,"The Langham, London","We loved everything about The Langham, from the ultra professional, welcoming, helpful and kind personnel to the impeccable rooms, the food, the location… everything! We were so happy to stay there and hopefully we will stay every time we visit London."
1402,"The Langham, London","My wife and I have been visiting The Langham, London, for the last line 14 years, and during every visit have been made to feel valued and cared for. This was our first visit as a family of five (this time with iur three children, 14, 11 and nine), and again we were cared for very well. The Langham, London, is our super luxurious home away from home."
1403,"The Langham, London","One of the best Hotels in the World. This is what Luxury is all about. We were left with memories of London and the Hotel. A hotel that not only understands what Luxury is but also deliveries this with such class and pride. The price is worth every moment in this special location. Housekeeping greeted us by name. The attention to details impressed us. We will be back for a lifetime of amazing stays. Thank you, Langham London you blew, our minds."
1404,"The Langham, London","We celebrated our wedding anniversary at the Langham and it was a wonderful weekend. The staff are attentive and make you feel very welcome. The food is excellent. We enjoyed a relaxed afternoon in the bar having drinks, the cocktails are superb."
1405,"The Langham, London","Great staff,,above and beyond if you like the feeling of being a welcomed guest in a 5 star hotel this is the place! From the moment your mode of transportation pulls into the impressive entrance and welcoming doormen at the Langham hotel until you depart they make you feel like it was their pleasure to have you as a guest. We will return, because it was OUR PLEASURE"
1406,"The Langham, London","I have stayed at this hotel several times and it has been great. This year the doorman was always talking to his partner you had to interrupt to get a cab. They made no effort to help get you seated for lunch or breakfast they didn’t seem to care you were a hotel guest. The menu was very limited so you had to look for restaurants around the hotel. I was disappointed with this stay, there comment to me was sorry it is the chelsea flower show we are very busy. Best part of the trip was their breakfast"
1407,"The Langham, London","We spent ten (10) days at The Langham London in deluxe room. I did extensive research on the best central London luxury hotels, reviewing reviews, both personal and professional to ultimately select The Langham Hotel based on this information. This and the proximity of the hotel to the theater district. It is a 400 room hotel yet the service we gathered from other guests we met there that the service is actually superior to a number of boutique luxury hotels in London. Based on our experience, I can honestly say I believe I made the right choice. The service is exceptional in all aspects. It is not a small boutique hotel yet the service matches or exceeds other hotels with similar standing or repute. Due to my wife's mobility issues and a large amount of luggage we needed for…"
1408,"The Langham, London","If you are truly looking for a home away from home service and experience, this is the hotel you are wanting to stay. All the staff members were always attentive and detailed with all of our needs (always provided extra service and went beyond our expecations)."
1409,"The Langham, London","The most fabulous hotel experience in London! From the concierge setting up all our private VIP tours, to the club lounge team taking extra care of our needs, this hotel ROCKS! Don't waste another minute..just book a suite at The Langham London and your butler will take care of the rest."
1410,"The Langham, London","If your looking to stay in a top hotel in London then you should really consider The Langham. The hotel itself is grand and beautifully decorated, but the staff and the way the go about their craft ensuring you do not want for anything and that nothing is too much trouble really make it an amazing place to stay. Another mention is the Langham club within the hotel, here you can eat drink and feel relaxed in your own private space being looked after by its wonderful staff."
1411,"The Langham, London",Truly world class accommodation with exceptional service. The staff at the Langham London are beyond belief and always made themselves available to assist and ensure we had a memorable stay. Their polite and friendly manner made our stay enjoyable and easy. Spotlessly clean rooms and regular turndowns kept the facilities immaculate. Thank you to the Langham London team.
1412,"The Langham, London","Booked a four day stay, hotel was lovey, excellent location. Room was very spacious and luxurious. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Arranged a special surprise on arrival which was executed to perfection. Breakfast was amazing."
1413,"The Langham, London","My wife and I returned to the Langham after our amazing stay last November. Once again we were so impressed with this hotel. The sense of calm is such a luxury when stepping in from the busy London streets. The main reason we returned though was because of our experience in the Executive Lounge. Once again, it was the staff within the lounge that made our stay so special. They go out of their way to ensure that you are made to feel welcome and cared for. This truly is a Hotel within a Hotel. Thankyou to the Langham and specifically the team from the Lounge. We look forward to seeing you again in November !"
1414,"The Langham, London","Staying at the Langham in London was a wonderful experience. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to impeccable service with exemplary hospitality. Knowing that we had an overnight flight, they had prepared our room and made up our bed for us to take a refreshing nap. It's the perfect way to start any vacation or business trip. Staff was very attentive throughout the visit. I highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a luxurious stay in London. Thank you, Langham team, for making our stay so memorable. Five stars all around."
1415,"The Langham, London","You have to go to this hotel at least ones in your life. Everything is just perfect. This hotel is not 5 stars hotel. IT IS 6 STARS for sure. There was so many details we have never experience before. You have to experience this. Thank you The Langham Hotel. We will be back, br J&P"
1416,"The Langham, London","If you can afford to stay at the Langham in London, do it. Without question one of the best hotels in the world and I’ve stayed at a lot of them. From the room amenities to the absolutely superb staff, I cannot recommend any more highly a hotel of this caliber. 5 stars +"
1417,"The Langham, London","For my 'big' birthday celebration, my mum and sisters booked for a girls celebration afternoon tea. It was fabulous! Our server, Frederico, was excellent. He was attentive without being intrusive and ensured that we were happy throughout our visit. We loved that the sandwiches, pastries and scones were served in a timely fashion without us feeling rushed even though we were given a 'slot' for our tea to last. I have told friends that if they are looking for an unforgettable afternoon tea, they need to go to The Langham. Thank you team for a wonderful afternoon!"
1418,"The Langham, London","Extremely comfortable with superb service and a terrific, central London location. The only downsides were the length of journey through the hotel to the pool and the slippery floors in the pool changing room and en route to the pool - plus, being central London, the rooms, though extremely comfortable, are fairly small."
1419,"The Langham, London","Phenomenal service, very comfortable and clean. The staff is very helpful. The location is very quiet but still nearby everything you'd want to walk to. Close to the Tube and easy to get a taxi. The Club is very well stocked and the breakfast and snacks are wonderful. The elevator is a bit slow but it's an old building that has been exceptionally renovated. We will be back! Highly recommend."
1420,"The Langham, London","We held our 10th Anniversary Gala Dinner at the Langham at the end of March and the events team at the hotel led by Chloe helped us to put on the most incredible evening. The hotel worked tirelessly with our fantastic event planner to make our evening special. From booking the ballroom to meeting the chefs and then enjoying the delicious dinner designed by the Roux brothers on the night, everything was of an incredibly high standard. The ballroom is beautiful and certain to impress your guests who will be waited on immaculately all evening. If you are trying to find somewhere to hold a special event, I would whole-heartedly recommend that you choose the Langham over any other West End Hotel."
1421,"The Langham, London","Nested within the busy Oxford Street area, the Langham has modestly stood in its place, throughout its history. The building blends into the architecture of the nearby area, only overshadowed by the BBC's HQ facade. Over the last 15 years, I have passed though the footsteps of the hotel, greeting the hotel as a sign of respect every time I walked through Regent Street. While living in London, I never stayed at the hotel, but since moving away, it has become a prime location for business trips. You are sure to find personalised luxury here. But let's face it, if you are searching for hotel reviews for the Langham, you might probably be searching for those who pick at its minor faults or major offerings. I offer to you neither, but a gentle look into how one of London's master…"
1422,"The Langham, London","Excellent location, courteous staffLots of attentive and nice staff members , pampering hotel. a spacious room. Dinner in the room was excellent. The breakfast was excellent, and the dinner service in the room was very tasty"
1423,"The Langham, London","We have been a regular customer to Langham hotel having stayed many times recently- unfortunately last weekend we were staying in the old Regent side of hotel, the room was nice and spacious however at 3am I awake on a terrible mattress - hard as a rock and couldn’t sleep. I called the reception and explain I couldn’t sleep on the mattress -to be told I was wrong and the mattress was from same supplier as the other rooms in the newer quarter we had previously stayed in - to which my response was ‘have you slept in a number of the hotel beds? Well I have and these are not same mattresses even if same supplier’ I was told there was nothing they could do about it even though I explained at 3am I was unable to sleep in a room at nearly £1000 a night! I woke my poor husband and…"
1424,"The Langham, London","The hotel was wonderful, it is located in the very city center, the room was super clean and comfortable beds, perfect delicious breakfast, moreover helpful and friendly stuff! It was Easter time, the hotel gave chocolate surprise to my daughter and many other surprises! Thank you so much !!!"
1425,"The Langham, London",Usually so very good. This trip has started so very bad. Couldn’t find my booking. Check in guy was surly like it was my fault even though I had the correct booking number. Then given a rubbish room with noisy aircon and the wrong bathroom configuration and apparently nothing better available even though I stay here every week. I’m sorry The Langham but you need to do much better than the experience tonight.
1426,"The Langham, London","Excellent, this hotel has the very rare attribute of being 100% in all respects from reservations to check out. The Staff are exemplary in all departments. The location is perfect for shopping and sight seeing."
1427,"The Langham, London","Terrible beds, terrible experience, night staff unhelpful, uncaring, left at 4am, slept in car, called reception to change rooms to sleep on a suitable bed to be told nothing available, but we checked on line and suites were available, would have happily paid extra, ive stayed here for the last 5 weeks every weekend but never again. This hotel believes its name is better than the guests, now staying at claridges, staff, hotel and care are far more courteous . I don’t usually write on social media sites but this whole experience had my wife in tears and others should be aware. On a positive the door men are fantastic, we will miss Mike and Ian and there hospitality- shame reception don’t share the same care to their loyal guests"
1428,"The Langham, London","Perfect hotel, perfect facilities, perfect service! Very kind and caring, helpfull staff. We experienced one of the best stay in a 5 star hotel. Traveling with a family, we felt like at home! Worth staying for several days!"
1429,"The Langham, London","This is an expensive hotel - no doubt. But, sometimes you get what you pay for, and that was the case here. I arrived a few hours before the official check-in time but was still able to check-in, which was much appreciated after my overnight flight. It was a little odd at check-in since I was told I was being upgraded, but the ""upgrade"" was actually the room class I had paid to be in, so I wasn't sure I understood that. ROOM: The room itself was very nice - quite large, had a nice view and was well decorated. The bed was a little hard, but not so much that it was uncomfortable. The bathroom needs a heated towel rack - it was freezing!! But, the walk-in shower was nice (although I missed the individual shower amenities - the large sizes seem a little unsanitary to me since…"
1430,"The Langham, London","Before I began I must say I did not stay in the hotel.I just waked by with my children and brought them close to the door to see it.The door staff were very kind and friendly and took the time to speak to us.When I explained we were not checking in or anything and that I was just showing it to my children they said please continue in ,you are very welcome.We stepped inside and the most beautiful scent filled the marble foyer.I would love to know what it was.I could have stayed there all day.Beautiful blossoms and piano playing drew your attention to a gorgeous room where people enjoyed lunch or afternoon tea.The staff was so very kind,polite and inviting and I am really grateful for that.It left a truly lovely impression of a beautiful city and someday we will check in❤️"
1431,"The Langham, London","Trip to London to celebrate a birthday. Absolutely everything was made perfect by the hotel, from the doorman, reception, table service to room facilities. Will be more than happy to return to the hotel in the future."
1432,"The Langham, London","The staff were very friendly, accommodating, welcoming and attentive. I received a cake and the hotel fragrance as a birthday gift. The swimming pool was beautifully lit and was quite during the evening so I had a solo swim. The relaxation room had Refreshments, slippers and towels for guest to use. The floor landings were beautifully decorated like the bedrooms. I was shown to my room by the receptionist and shown all the facilities in my room. The cleaning staff came into my room to provide new clean towels during my stay. I had dinner at the palm court, I arrived 10 mins before the kitchen closed but I was still greeted and seated by the friendly restaurant manager. The food was good considering I ordered a burger and chips. I received a mini cake and rose champagne…"
1433,"The Langham, London",Last week in one of the family's favourite places to be in London for Easter weekend. Always great fun and location remains perfect. Highly recommended for those who can afford prices which aren't cheap
1434,"The Langham, London","This is my 4th time of visiting and staying in the executive lounge just exceptional in all areas from the check in the history of the place the food rooms service and the staff are just exceptional and made my birthday experience totally amazing, thank you all."
1435,"The Langham, London",The ambience and location of the Langham is just wonderful. It’s like coming home. The staff and level of service is exceptional. We love staying here. The facilities are amazing and nothing is any trouble

1437,"The Langham, London","Came here for 3 nights stay! We were very happy with the top notch interior of room, food, service and facility. The server Frederick / Federick is so hospitable and friendly. He remembers our order whenever we drop by the lounge for drinks. He is definitely a gem to the team."

1440,"The Langham, London","We stayed for 3 nights at The Langham, London. The hotel has perfect location - right on the end of Regent Street next to BBC Headquarters. You step out of the hotel and you are on Regent Street. The location made it possible for us to move around at any time of the day. The check-in process was swift, rooms were small but well-appointed and breakfast was nice. Overall, we had a lovely stay at The Langham, London. They gave us a VIP Card for our Bicester Village visit which made the visit more comfortable and we could access lounge at Bicester Village and avail discounts."
1441,"The Langham, London","hotel location is convenient and easy access to different areas; service in restaurants was attentive and made guests feel comfortable, breakfast has a wide range of choices; house keeping is doing a good job"
1442,"The Langham, London","Terrific, memorable stay at the Langham. Absolutely stunning hotel with history, character, well-appointed/elegant rooms and extremely pleasant/helpful staff. The location is perfect - you are in the center of it all yet it is easy to escape into the quiet luxury of this incredible hotel. My husband and I travel to London often and this is easily our new favorite place to stay. Special thanks to Lawrence and his team for their kindness, patience and hospitality at they helped sort out one or two room changes. :) We will be sending everyone we know traveling to London to the Langham and can’t wait to return - hopefully in April! Wanted to note they also very kindly granted us an early check-in after an overnight flight from New York. We have never had this request honored at…"
1443,"The Langham, London","The hotel is very tastefully done, traditional contemporary decor. Staff were excellent and the location was great. Walking distance to lots of things. The Palm court staff were sensational. An incredible team !!"
1444,"The Langham, London","The hotel is wonderful in every way-from the minute you walk in the door, the service is exceptional! The staff are so polite and attentive, and one is made to feel special from the moment that you walk in. We booked an executive room, and what a treat it was.. It allows access to The Langham Club, which is such a nice space to spend time in, and I can't imagine booking any other type of room now. In fact, it was so lovely in there, that we ended up eating breakfast in there rather than bothering with the restaurant. The rooms are comfy, and spotless. I didn't use the pool, but my husband and son did, and they seemed to thoroughly enjoy it! The location of the hotel is rather good too. I've already booked another stay."
1445,"The Langham, London","Lovely hotel with great service and location. The rooms are nice, large and clean. They deliver all the things one would expect from a 5 star hotel. The lounge is a big plus. Mila the butler is warm and caring."
1446,"The Langham, London","We stayed at the Langham for over a week altogether and loved the location and beauty of this beautiful hotel. The Langham has the exterior feel of a classic London grand hotel, but the inside is intimate with modern amenities and high style. We stayed in a suite on the 7th floor which was perfect for us and our teenager. The club level on the 3rd floor was an area we used heavily for breakfast and evening drinks and snacks. The service and food on the club level is well worth the option. The bar on the main level is vibrant and the perfect place for a cocktail while the restaurant is elegant and beautiful for meals, although quite formal. Not sure we would have utilized on premise dining as much if we had not had the club level. The location couldnt be better with the hotel at…"
1447,"The Langham, London","Amazing hotel - Staff , Rooms and Lounge just fantastic. From the time you arrive to the time you leave, the Hotel and its staff just spoil you. The rooms are spotless and feel like an Oasis in London. Our home from Home when in London."
1448,"The Langham, London","I have been fortunate enough to stay in all of the best hotels in London including the Dorchester, the savoy, The Ritz plus many others, over the last couple of years however my family and I have started staying at The Langham London, this hotel is amazing and we have made a decision between us all that unless something was to drastically change, we will never stay anywhere else, we are treated like family from the moment we arrive until the moment we leave, the service we receive from everyone at the hotel is far superior to other hotels, the food and drink is also great and the afternoon tea in the palm can not be compared with other hotels serving afternoon tea, if you can afford to pay the extra I would very much recommend upgrading to an executive room which gives you…"
1449,"The Langham, London","We had an amazing stay at The Langham for my partners birthday. We’ve been to the Artizian bar many times, even having our first date there 5 years ago, but this was the first time we’ve stayed. The staff were truly amazing, going well above our expectations, from the reception staff providing a free room upgrade, the waiters at Palm Court providing a free bottle of champagne, a cake, flowers and a cocktail and the staff at the Artizian bar providing another small cake and singing happy birthday. We had a free bottle of champagne, fruit and sweets and another cake in our room as well as a gift bag that included a candle and diffuser. The staff made our stay truly memorable and we will definitely be staying again."
1450,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,We booked this hotel for our son & future daughter in law’s stay for the weekend of their wedding & I have to say that both the staff & the hotel were impeccable. The food was excellent & all the staff went out of their way to make us all feel so special. Luxury in abundance.
1451,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"This hotel was amazing , the staff were very attentive, friendly and would help you in any way they could without hesitation The suite that we stayed in was out of this world, extremely clean, all your needs catered for and a very comfortable room The small kindness of gifts on our pillow and in the room was exceptional and made our stay even more special, with that personal touch The facilities were great and the meals in the hotel were outstanding We would definitely recommend this hotel, we could not fault it, and the location opposite Kensington park was perfect We hope to visit again one day"
1452,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Had a fantastic stay at the Milestone Hotel- I stayed for one night on the Sunday when it was Coronation weekend, but wished I stayed more than that. It's a beautiful hotel, and afyer checking in, I got shown round the hotel. I was very impressed with the customer service - the little things like having a coffee delivered to your room after your wake-up call, tea, coffee facilities, box of biscuits, turn-down service - ensuring that you enjoy your stay. I had dinner in the hotel (I had £70 credit for food and beverages) and used this for dinner - the chicken pie was delicious and the honeycomb ice cream was delicious too. I really enjoyed my room which was a superior queen room. I will definitely stay in thr hotel again."
1453,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Exceptional experience in the best 5 star hotel i have stayed in (UK). From the moment we were greeted at the door, handing over the car keys to have the car parked, to the moment the car was returned a couple of days later was a fantastic experience. The Welcoming was warm & professional. The Room it self was over 2 floors. Beautiful looking shower room. The Bed was so big and comfortable. The Wall to wall mirrors was a nice surprise bar a few windows. Considering the location, it was so peaceful and quiet. The TV quality was excellent. A real bug bear of mine when you stay in nice hotels. We had full access to SKY and BT. Sport. The Breakfast was excellent. I really couldnt fault the stay and would highly recommend to anyone considering in staying in a nice Hotel…"
1454,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"This is a grand old hotel. Frome the first day we walked in, it felt friendly. Everyone was friendly and fun. Steve (the Doorman), Steve (concierge), Dino, Renato, Tim (the Doorman), Grant, Fran, and Claire were some of the funnest. The afternoon tea was grand, and their signature sandwich was very tasty. Compliments to the Chef. This is one of the places that we will try to come back to."
1455,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"The service was so good that now we have been spoilt and will find it hard to like any other Hotel. Everyone was super pleasant and warm. It felt like we were staying with family (the good ones). The whole experience was top notch. Be it the rooms, the afternoon tea, the Bar and the dining. We absolutely will be going back again"
1456,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,From start to finish our experience was first class! The staff could not do enough to ensure your stay was memorable 10/10 we will definitely be back. Location was also very good with great transport links.
1457,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,I had a wonderful experience at The Milestone Hotel and Residences at my first trip to London. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean. I also had a nice experience dinning in. It is near a train station and one of the Royal gardens. I would definitely recommend to stay at The Milestone Hotel.
1458,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Absolutely nothing negative to say about this property. Great friendly and attentive staff, fantastic breakfast menu, amazing location. Comfortable and quiet rooms. We were in the King deluxe room for 5 nights which offered daily bottled water, turn down service and a welcome gift . Would highly recommend this hotel"
1459,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"We consider this Hotel our 2nd home when we come to London, since all services provided have always been excellent. The staff are always helpful and friendly ready with a smile and have an eye for detail."
1460,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"We have traveled to London many times and this was absolutely the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at there. From the moment we were greeted at the front door, given a tour and shown to our rooms the service was outstanding. The hotel is beautiful and historic with a fabulous bar. Located in the Kensington neighborhood meant an easy walk to so many good restaurants and easy access to the tube. We were sorry to leave and look forward to our next visit there."
1461,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"The Milestone is a beautiful, small hotel that is conveniently located in London and has superb service, including an outstanding restaurant. Afternoon tea with grandchildren was delightful. We strongly recommend this hotel!"
1462,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Our stay here was excellent. From the moment we arrived, the staff were welcoming, knowledgeable and helpful with our questions and needs. We will stay here each time we are in London. One evening, we were planning to walk to a recommended restaurant. We asked about directions and the concierge walked with us to the restaurant. This is a beautiful, well-run, comfortable hotel. We highly recommend it."
1463,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,The reviews of this hotel sounded amazing! We thought we would treat ourselves at the end of our Europe trip and book this hotel for three nights. We got to our room and it was tiny! Wayyyy too much furniture for a hotel room! Definitely not needed. We had no room to open our suitcases. There was no view and it only had a double bed. We asked to be upgraded to a bigger room which swiftly happened. The next room had a much bigger bed and view of the park. (Still too much chunky furniture and no room for luggage) We could have stayed at a major hotel chain with bigger and better facilities for a much cheaper price. Upon checking out the bill said it charged 15 pounds a day for tips! We asked for this to be removed. There is no coffee machine in the rooms No mini bar Not worth…
1464,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Have been to the Milestone many times. Returned once again in January 2023 and we had, again, a lovely experience. Great service, lovely friendly staff, charming view from our lovely room with all mod cons. Lovely breakfast room, great location. Will be back."
1465,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"My stay here at the Milestone was above and beyond anything I could have dreamed of. I'm almost left speechless at how wonderfully we were treated and how incredible the accommodations were. The building itself is impeccably decorated and transports you back to Victorian era London. The breakfasts were divine- smoked salmon eggs benedict every day please! The location was perfect, just across from Kensington Palace and beautiful Hyde Park. I can't recommend this hotel enough, and I'm already planning my next stay there! And a special thank you to Andrew and all of the other staff that helped make my trip a dream come true<3"
1466,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"From the moment we were greeted at the door, we knew The Milestone would be our home away from home. The impeccable staff made us feel so welcome, and the service provided was always extended with warmth and a smile. Hotel staff is a reflection of management, and this carefully curated crew takes their cue from the delightful and charming GM, Andrew Pike. The rooms were inviting, with wonderful beds, antiques throughout, beautifully appointed marble bathrooms, and every amenity one could want. If morning tea or coffee is your thing, just ask, and a huge box containing cups, kettle, a French press, and drinks will be provided. The lounge, restaurant, and bar make you feel like you’re in an English manor house, and the servers are happy to chat with you about sightseeing, or…"
1467,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Recently stayed at this beautiful hotel in the heart of Kensington...location and condition of the property were amazing, but it was really the staff that took the experience to another level. Truly everyone was helpful; however, there were a few team members who stood out including Renato, Steve, Tim, Angelo and Victoria. Next trip to London will definitely include a stay at this wonderful hotel."
1468,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"My husband and I had our wedding reception at the Milestone. The service and food was impeccable and the staff were just fantastic. Right from the attention to detail and all the help they provided, could not fault them at all. The events coordinator, Emma was fantastic and so so helpful with the planning and organisation of the day. We were on a tight budget, where a lot of other venues we looked at were so inflexible with certain things and made us feel like we had to pay and arm and a leg, the Milestone worked within our budget (within reason of course) to help us achieve what we wanted on the day. Really felt like they went above and beyond to make our day that extra special. Highly recommend them for small parties, weddings and events!!"
1469,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"This is my 3rd stay at this hotel. That is because I really like staying at the Milestone. Whenever we've been out for a full day in London, coming back to the hotel is very comfortable and relaxing. Getting a drink from Lilo in the bar is something I look forward to every day I am there. The staff at the hotel are all very welcoming and friendly, and the location is good with nice rooms with views over Kensington Gardens. The breakfast room is very cozy, and the bedrooms are all really quite nice. They run a great operation."
1470,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Amazing amazing amazing!!!!! Me and my fiancé booked for one night for our anniversary and… well!! i’ve never enjoyed myself more!!!!! When we entered we were introduced with lovely staff with smiles (Heather at reception and Zen who gave us a building tour and entry). The hotel had upgraded us (for free!!) from a standard room to the Mistinguett Suite (!) and it was more than beautiful- the room was lush with a balcony, in hotel fresh homemade cookies and tea. They also gave us a free cocktail each upon entry (both of which that aren’t on their bar cocktail menu). My fiancé had left a booking note that it was for our anniversary and when we arrived after our meal our room had been tidied and been set up with chocolates on the pillows with rose petals, candles too, and a plate…"
1471,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"In January this year we got married at the Milestone Hotel, and let me tell you, It was the best decision we've made! The ceremony, reception, dinner and the party were all held at the hotel and we cannot complain about one thing. Everything was well organised, food was delicious, staff was incredibly attentive and our wedding suite was just stunning. Emma, our Banqueting Executive, was in constant communication with us throughout the whole process, making sure that everything was organised as we requested, and nothing was a problem for her. She really tried to accommodate every request we had. So, If you are looking for a small wedding venue, combined with british luxury, this is it. Don't look no further!"
1472,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Amazing service and accommodations. Super location, within walking distance to some really good restaurants. Didn’t dine in much except for Breakfast - but that menu is outstanding. Concierge & Staff go above and beyond expectations. 5-Star hotel all the way."
1473,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"We can enthusiastically report that we have found ""Our Hotel"" insofar as London (and perhaps the rest of the world, too) is concerned. The Milestone is utterly unique, and utterly perfect. Our initial stay there was just a one-night stopover between flights, but we were so smitten with the place that we instantly decided to route our next European trip through London for the sole purpose of being able to enjoy a proper multi-night stay at The Milestone. If, as you read this, you find yourself thinking, ""Hmm... this sounds too good to be true"", that's because ""Too good to be true"" is an entirely apt description of The Milestone. Treat yourself to it! (Peter & Felicia, Phoenix AZ)"
1474,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Beautiful spaces in this hotel. Moderate sized well appointed room Exceptional service staff Exceptional meals Easy access to bus, underground within a few blocks. Cross the street to Kensington Park and Palace The fitness room is bright and well appointed with jacuzzi/ pool room attached. Sauna Highly recommended hotel- we will stay again!"
1475,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"What an absolutely wonderful hotel. Everything was perfect. The hotel is spotless with the ideal blend of historic charm and luxe, modern decor and amenities. My daughter and I were treated with such kindness. We had high tea which was fabulous and decided to upgrade to a room with a view of the park. Truly incredible. The hotel is perfectly located near the UnderGround…we were able to get everywhere with ease. There is a Santander bike spot 2 blocks away so we were able to rent 2 bikes and cycle Hyde Park…a highlight of our trip. The Milestone is a true 5-star hotel. I can’t imagine a better way to experience London."
1476,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"My wife and I had a 3 night stay at The Milestone recently, at a rate of £430 per night for bed and breakfast. The Red Carnation brand is familiar to us, having stayed 15 times in 6 properties from their portfolio previously. The brand gives us a number of things that we require as guests in a hotel, including luxurious surroundings, a peaceful night’s sleep on a quality mattress and bedding, good food and wine, but perhaps most important of all – quality, personal service. All this doesn’t come cheap as rates usually start at around £250 in all hotels in the portfolio. The brand has also started adding an ‘optional’ service charge per night recently. Having stayed at Summer Lodge in Dorset during August 2022, we decided to give The Milestone a try for the first time since the…"
1477,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"A wonderful Afternoon Tea! The staff were helpful, friendly and went above and beyond to ensure we had all we needed/wanted. A great time was thoroughly enjoyed and the beautiful settings of the hotel made it a luxurious event celebrating my mums upcoming birthday. The Afternoon tea was fresh, scrumptious and the best I’ve had in London yet! I would recommend anyone to try it and I look forward to returning to try out some more of their food menu. Thank you Milestone Staff x"
1478,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,Beautiful afternoon tea at the Milestone hotel yesterday. The highlights for my was the delicious chicken sandwich rolled in almonds and the black sesame seed macaroon - but in all honesty the whole offering was great and there was an abundance of food. The service we received was great and nothing was too much for them.
1479,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Our recent stay at Milestone hotel and residences was excellent. Hotel staff including front desk, house keeping were outstanding . The service was very attentive, we especially appreciated the thoughtfulness of the Front desk, concierge and restaurant service staff who arranged for our breakfast and coffee in “to go” containers when we were running late for a day trip. We look forward to staying at Milestone residences again in future."
1480,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Pleased with my visit to this hotel. The staff was very friendly, efficient, helpful. They greeted me every time, help find transportation and provided good places to visit. The room was fantastic, they kept it clean. The tea experience was wonderful."
1481,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Went back for couple of drinks in the Stables Bar, met with some of the familiar faces. They truly know how to care for the guest and staffs. Thank you for coming to say hello Mr Pike, Tom and Pranav. ND"
1482,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"I could not have been more pleased with my visit to this hotel. (A second visit to the Red Carnation Group). Staff was superior! All were friendly, efficient, helpful courteous, and yes, kind! They remembered my name and greeted me, by name, each time I returned for the night. The room was fantastic and tea/breakfast/dinner, wonderful. Highly recommend this hotel!"
1483,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"An absolutely delightful experience from start to finish. The care and kindness shown to my little girl and I made it feel like home. I honestly cannot rate this hotel and the staff highly enough. We walked into a gorgeous room, which had a vast array of the most magical little touches. The staff went to great lengths to make my daughter feel comfortable, explaining how things worked and being generally loving and attentive. The service here rivals the Savoy and we will most certainly be back.. Thankyou again"
1484,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"The Milestone is synonymous with high quality service, sumptuous state-of-the-art accommodation within an impeccable period-held property maintained to a sensitive high level of detail and attention with a respectful nostalgic nod to a bygone era of historic luxury London. For the best English Breakfast in quality and service in London not forgetting The Milestone’s reputed Afternoon Tea with a unique sandwich included, designed by the Founder and President of the Red Carnation Hotel Collection Bea Tollman, to be enjoyed in a quintessential English setting, look no further. The characterful Stables Bar offers a great setting for memorable Cocktails savoured. It’s for all these reasons we have found reason to check-in no less than 60 times in the last 12 years and counting. You…"
1485,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"We recently stayed at this hotel during a weekend trip to London and we absolutely loved it! The staff were so friendly and welcoming and couldn’t do enough to make sure we had a wonderful stay. So many thoughtful touches. We love that the hotel has kept its old world charm and traditional elements. The cocktail lounge and restaurant are beautiful. Our room was quite small (we just booked a superior queen) but quiet with good air conditioning. Next time we stay we would go for a king room. Good location for us, close to the museums and tube station as well as Kensington palace. We will definitely be back! This hotel has great reviews and they definitely deserve it. The staff are what really makes this hotel stand out! 5 star ⭐️"
1486,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,The service at this hotel was top notch and the rooms were beautiful. We particularly liked the Stable area which was right off the bar. It was a small room where our family gathered and enjoyed an excellent late meal and hand crafted cocktails. The hotel was in a nice area across from Kensington castle and park with beautiful homes and embassy buildings nearby. I would recommend this hotel to others who travel to London for work or pleasure.
1487,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Excellent service, happy to help with any request. Great rooms with very comfortable beds including nightly 'turn-down' treats. Rooms were well sound-proofed too. Very good location on Kensington High Street. Plan to go again soon."
1488,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"From the moment you get to the steps of the hotel you are greeted with a big smile and the hospitality gets better with every passing moment. We stayed in the Ruhlmann suite which is a corner suite with great views of Kensington Palace. The showers and bathtub were beyond inviting and the turndown service made you look forward to your time in the suite. However, i must say that it is the service that makes the Milestone stand out from all other hotels that i stayed at in London. They always go above and beyond to show that they truly care about your stay and that your visit is second to none. I have stayed at many other properties in London but am very happy to call the Milestone my home away from home and will stay no where else! Shout out to Leo and Angelo!!! simply the best…"
1489,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,Staff were second to none. Room was sumptuous and we were made to feel at home. We always try to stay in a Red Carnation Hotel when in London as you know the level of service will be too class. Can’t recommend Milestone highly enough. Had a fantastic stay and will definitely be back.
1490,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Fabulous stay at the Milestone. Thank you to all the team. Front of house were fantastic from the door men, concierge and reception. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we were kindly given an upgrade which was very much appreciated. Lovely welcome drink on arrival to the room as well. Thank you, will def return very soon."
1491,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Just came back from a wonderful stay at the Milestone Hotel in London. Have to say that this was one of the best, if not the best, hotel experiences that we’ve ever had in the UK. The service truly is five star - and it is that way throughout the hotel - from the folks who greet you at the entrance to the reception and the restaurants to housekeeping - everyone makes you feel genuinely welcome and appreciated. I do not know for certain of course, but somehow it feels there is a great team spirit and vibe among the staff which gets reflected in this exceptional customer experience. The hotel itself is beautiful with a long history (used to be a stable servicing the Kensington Palace way back in time - thanks doorman Steve for that tidbit of info) and now obviously a truly…"
1492,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"We just had a truly special stay at the Milestone. First, the hotel is absolutely beautiful. Second, the service, from the doormen, to the front desk, to the concierge, to the restaurant staff - is the best, the most personal, I have had at any hotel I have ever stayed. The entirety of the staff are engaging, friendly, knowledgable and truly go out of their way to make your experience special, and are clearly empowered to do so. I can rattle off so many examples during our 5 night stay including 1) little treats that were left in our room to welcome us and each night at turndown; 2) the entire restaurant staff recognizing and proactively accommodating a dairy and peanut allergy within our family even creating a whole separate vegan sandwich/desert plate during our afternoon…"
1493,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Whilst being amongst the glitterati of 5 star luxury London hotels, the Milestone stands out for combining the relaxed atmosphere of a beautiful Kensington home, with fabulous bedrooms, great food and service but above all, the friendliness and professionalism that sets Red Carnation apart from the rest. A stay that always seems to exceed expectations."
1494,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,This hotel is an absolute gem of Kensington! We had a splendid dinner at the Cheneston's and the staff cannot be more friendly and professional. The bar team made cocktails tailored to our taste and was always reachable. Breakfast portion is generous and delicious. Would definitely recommend the omelette.
1495,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"We stayed at the Milestone for 4 nights. We had very high expectations from the reviews and the hotel website and we were not disappointed. The hotel is superb. Clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. We felt right at home. The afternoon tea was excellent. We also tried the bar which was also very good. The Milestone is our new address in London."
1496,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Stopped by for a quick cocktail and ended up having more than planned! The bar service is fantastic and the cocktails did not disappoint, the most delicious cocktails I’ve had in London in a long time, I cannot wait to return!"
1497,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,At a recommendation from my brother in law we decided to give the Milestone a go for dinner. We arrived early for our reservation and had a drink in the Stables Bar. Lilo was a terrific host and very hospitable and we tried the smoked old fashioned which is a must try! Paolo the restaurant manager came through to introduce himself which we thought was a very personal touch. Him and the team looked after us and recommended we tried the new tasting menu that had recently launched. We were blown away by the quality of the food and the attentive service. A hidden gem found right on our doorstep.
1498,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,"Recently returned from a 3 night family staycation to celebrate a big 40th Birthday. We were so excited to return to The Milestone Hotel after being blown away by our initial visit last year. Disappointingly, there were no bells and whistles to speak of at check-in this time, no offer of a welcome drink etc.. The receptionist didn't reference that we were return customers, instead she repeatedly apologised for the slow computer system when trying to authorise our credit card for incidentals. It was disappointing not to get that home from home welcome that we'd been so looking forward to since booking this stay last year! After check-in was completed we made our way into the lounge area for our champagne afternoon tea reservation. Unfortunately, the cold and impersonal…"
1499,The Milestone Hotel and Residences,Myself and my partner recently had a night in London and decided to book this beautiful hotel due to the close proximity to the royal albert hall. The hotel and service was immaculate from start to finish. The staff really go above and beyond to make your stay memorable. I loved the quirky old english style to this hotel and the room was just breathtaking. Thank you so much for an amazing stay. Hope to visit again in the future
1500,Hope Street Hotel,"Highly recommend, exceptionally clean. Bathroom was pristine and very modern Amazing breakfast! Praise needed for Stamos for the best vegan breakfast! Great service by all and a well done to Josh. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼⭐️ Would def stay again if I was in Liverpool."
1501,Hope Street Hotel,"I stayed here the night before my wedding and then the night of my wedding - to be spoilt! It was so lovely - there could have a been a few things done differently (we didn't have soap, no extra pillows in the room - we ran out of time to get any more and forgot) the robe sizes aren't the biggest. Every single thing else was INCREDIBLE - most comfortable bed - bathroom was wonderful - an amazing and someone on reception ran around the hotel to get us an extension lead so we could steam my wedding dress <3 It was a beautiful room I wish I could stay all over again! Thank you so much for our congratulations chocolates - that was lovely to come back to <3 I wouldn't stay again the night of someone having a wedding there though - I had mine the next day and didn't get much…"
1502,Hope Street Hotel,"This is a lovely, clean, stylish and comfortable almost boutique hotel in a perfect location for The Phil. Particularly loved the immaculately clean bathroom..a very comfortable stay indeed. The attached restaurants are great too!"
1503,Hope Street Hotel,"We had our wedding at Hope Street Hotel on 20th November 2021, as part of the package we got a nights stay for our 1st Wedding Anniversary. When we arrived the receptionist wished us happy anniversary and was so friendly and kind. We expected to be given a standard room however, when we opened the door we were met with the most beautiful suite which has an amazing view of the philharmonic from our balcony. Hope Street Hotel was a perfect wedding setting and a gorgeous place to celebrate our first anniversary. We’ll be back for our second 😊"
1504,Hope Street Hotel,"Stayed once again at this beautiful hotel for a concert at the Philharmonic Hall. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated to the most wonderful service, and stayed in a room that was out of this world. We ate in the hotels superb restaurant where the food is fine dining and of the most excellent standard, the service across the board in this classy hotel along with the room standards and how beautiful the hotel is makes it our hotel of choice every time."
1505,Hope Street Hotel,"Found the Hope Street Hotel by chance online and we were very happy with it. The hotel is within minutes’ walk of many of the sites everyone wants to see, as well as a few Beatles sites. Staff was super. Restaurants - we were only there for three nights, but had breakfast there every day, as well as four times for lunch/dinner. It’s a very easy and enjoyable place to stay!"
1506,Hope Street Hotel,"Staff is very helpful and friendly, the hotel is comfortable and the rooms are equipped with all you need, including a choice of water, coffee and teas to make on your own if you want. The building is historic and was re-built inside in a very original and cosy, yet elegant manner with lots of wood. Breakfast is great, egg-based and other additions will be freshly prepared by very friendly staff. The only downside of the hotel is some noise from Hope Street outside, if you have rooms facing that and if you are extremely sensitive."
1507,Hope Street Hotel,Fabulous views from roof top terrace for a wedding reception. Our shower did not work ( recommend hotel checks that things work in rooms as was extremely inconvenient). Ups graded to corner suite which was superb. Very spacious with views of sunset over Liverpool. Staff very friendly and good service. Breakfast was nice but not too keen on the fruit put into pots. Strange but no soap In any of the rooms and told to use shower gel. Also to use dos was an additional £40 for 2 hours which seemed extortionate. Never had to pay to use a spa when a hotel guest before. Reasonable value for money. Location is a 30 minute walk to shopping in city centre but in a fabulous area with a few hood pavement cafes and great architectur and cobbled streets. Would return
1508,Hope Street Hotel,"I came for an exam at the university and ended up staying another x2 nights! One intentionally...the other due to rail strikes, but the staff were very accommodating and were able to sort me out. Excellent overall stay would definitely come back."
1509,Hope Street Hotel,"Very disappointed in this hotel thought it was going to be something special but sadly let down on many levels. As a special treat my friend and I upgraded our twin room, the room was small with a tiny window nothing like the advertised room, we spoke to reception and we were offered an alternative however we were staying 5 days and had already unpacked so we decided against this, there was little by way of apology or any offer of a refund etc, the receptionist did admit there was an ssue with photos of the rooms. If this had been an isolated incident I probably would not be writing this poor review but other things were poor, tv not working properly, remote control battery not working handed 2 batteries at reception but when i got back to the room it required a screwdriver, …"
1510,Hope Street Hotel,"I Have stayed in better premier inns, uninterested staff, shocking service. Review of Hope Street Hotel Spa Reviewed yesterday via mobile Me and my friend booked this hotel as a treat because it looked lovely, unfortunately the room we got was nothing like the picture of the deluxe twin we booked, more like a standard travel lodge, we had a tiny window you could see anything from, the tv wouldn’t work properly, there was no soap or hand wash, our 2 robes were hanging in the wardrobe soaking wet, the cleaner only cleaned our room twice on the 5 days we were there so we had to keep asking for tea bags, toilet roll and towels, We booked as it said it had indoor and outdoor pools, then I received an email saying there was a charge of £35 per person per day to access this, we decided…"
1511,Hope Street Hotel,"Excellent room, great service from reception staff and a stunning view over the city. Welcoming and friendly staff. Outstanding cleanliness of the hotel room, only issue is the parking which is quite expensive but all in all one of the best hotels in the city."
1512,Hope Street Hotel,"The hotel, accomodation, ammenities and breakfast very all first class. Only criticisms are that the bare floorboards meant I could hear the person above me walking around at 5am, so would request a top floor room in future and that, for the price, breakfast could have been included."
1513,Hope Street Hotel,"Food at its best in the evening. The a la carte menu was divine, whereas lunch and breakfast were pretty standard. The staff are friendly & helpful, the accommodation is of a great standard and the location is good. My main gripe is the coffee which, for a hotel of this standard was just not good enough. However overall a very enjoyable stay!"
1514,Hope Street Hotel,"As discussed when booking this was supposed to be a very special night as my husband has had cancer and I am a carer for my Dad and we haven’t been away for years / we were given a grant for a special short break but for the price (£400) felt somewhat disappointed :- room basic - coffee machine not working and staff disinterested, dripping tap, overly complicated shower/ bath settings, evening meal was lovely from fixed price menu but tiny tiny portions and lots of hidden extras piled on to bill/ service was fire waited ages despite stating we were in a hurry as going out. Breakfast was poor / cold poached eggs & cheap sausages and shoved on rickety little table by cutlery store -my husband got sick after his breakfast and as the signage/ access to toilets us so poor he had to…"
1515,Hope Street Hotel,"The best hotel in Liverpool, or cabbie told us, and he is right! Away from the busy downtown/waterfront crowds, across from the Liverpool Philharmonic, this is an upscale hotel in an upscale neighborhood, across the street from the pub where Paul McCartney performed with James Corden. Our room featured beautiful new wooden floors, a great amount of sunlight, and we could watch the crowds going in and out of the Philharmonic (Sparks played there the night we arrived and celebs all stay at The Hope Street Hotel). Lovely adjoining restaurants and front desk staff. Room perfectly cleaned. We will always remember our stay here at one of the best hotels in the world."
1516,Hope Street Hotel,We have stayed at Hope St many times and have always been impressed. On our last visit we dropped off the luggage before check in time. We didn't even have to say our names as we were greeted with reception staff who had remembered us from previous visits. When we got to our room the luggage had already been taken up. Its this attention to detail that stands out from other hotels. The room as always was spotless. Can't wait to return for another relaxing stay.
1517,Hope Street Hotel,"Had a lovely weekday stay here. Very good value midweek, not sure I’d want to pay weekend prices. Staff were lovely, rooms spacious. Highlight was the spa which was wonderful (couldn’t quite get the sensors to work on outdoor pool though!)."
1518,Hope Street Hotel,"An excellent hotel in city centre close to the heart of the city. Nice mixture of historical architecture with modern, spacious feel. Vey clean, very heplful staff. Highly recommended. I did not hear much road noise and found the stay very relaxing."
1519,Hope Street Hotel,"I will run out of superlatives- the staff are amazing and they really make the difference to the whole visit! There are lots of beautiful hotels but they really make this one stand out! I always leave wanting to take the beds, bedding, and half the furnishings home with me. Stunning spa, great location and great choice of places and types of food to eat in the hotel and nearby. We have been several times and always look forward to our visit!"
1520,Hope Street Hotel,"The entire hotel was faultless, as soon as you walk in the doors to the reception. The staff so professionally and super easy check in and check out procedure. Had sunday lunch in the connected london carriage restaurnent which was the best sunday lunch ive ever had. Room was spotless and excellant size, amazing shower and bath. Bed was perfect and had amazing comfy nights sleep. The best hotel ive ever stayed in not just uk but possibly the world."
1521,Hope Street Hotel,"We were delighted by the location in an interesting part of the city. First impressions were good. Interesting and imaginative public spaces. Reception was very friendly and efficient. Our rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable, if a little Spartan. The large bathroom could have done with a larger surround to the basin, and somewhere to put my book and cuppa whilst sitting on the throne! A very minor point though. The reason for the downgrade was breakfast. In exchange for £50 for the two of us we had a limited range of fruits yogurts and breads. The cooked option was distinctly poor. Although the hotel was relatively quiet, the chef had chosen to precook dozens of fried eggs and inferior quality bacon. It looked unappetising, and the chef unsmiling and…"
1522,Hope Street Hotel,"Hope Street will always have a place in my heart. I was born and bred in the Hope street area but now live in Stockton Heath, Warrington, so when I need my Motherland fix Hope Street is my go to ( my home from home). We had our Wedding here too and what an amazing day it was, from the minute we checked in till when we left the staff were exceptional. This hotel has amazing views of Liverpool and is located in the beautiful Georgian Quarter. The rooms are contemporary, stylish and very comfortable. The breakfast in 1931 is scrumptious and again the staff/chefs are lovely. I also have to mention the London Carriage Works Restaurant too, food is outstanding in a lovely surroundings. I love you Hope Street Hotel - Keep up the excellent work!"
1523,Hope Street Hotel,"Check the topper if you're in room 322. Unbeknown to me it was hanging off the edge of the bed which caused me to slide off in my sleep in the night, split the bridge of my nose on the bedside cabinet and end up with a profusely bleeding cut, two black eyes and whiplash. Despite reporting this to the duty manager, who ensured me housekeeping would review, the bed was not corrected, the blood wasn't even cleaned up when the room was serviced. Even without the event I would have expected a better room make up with a hotel of this apparent standard. The hotel have been totally dismissive of the whole incident. This was my worst ever stay and treatment in a hotel and nothing would take me back."
1524,Hope Street Hotel,"I came to Hope Street Hotel Spa from Essex where i was visiting my Best Friend. We had booked in for the Back Massage and Treatment. I was allocated a massage by Dimitri. Dimitri was so kind, gentle and polite. He made me feel so relaxed and comfortable. The environment was entirely calming and I am so grateful to Dimitri for making my visit so relaxing! The treatment was one of the best i’ve ever had."
1525,Hope Street Hotel,"Gorgeous hotel, room was immaculate, location was central to everything I wanted to do. Staff were friendly and helpful without being the ‘service industry’ friendly. Would definitely book again and recommend to others."
1526,Hope Street Hotel,"The hotel, staff and all the services are First Class. We would recommend the Hotel to anyone without hesitation. My daughter was married on the 5th Floor on the 20th April and we wanted to return and savour the rest of the Hotel. The Wedding services are absolutely fantastic as well!"
1527,Hope Street Hotel,"A chic, stylish, high-quality and ultra-convenient hotel that’s perfectly situated between the Georgian quarter and city centre. Have stayed here several times and also used the spa facilities on many occasions. I always look forward to staying at the Hope Street Hotel, the staff are so smiley and helpful, the amenities are top notch and I’m always assured of a peaceful night’s sleep. Highly recommended."
1528,Hope Street Hotel,"My first review of a hotel on here as I feel huge disappointment in how this place runs..The hotel itself was a BIG disappointment. We paid over £700 for 2 nights and if i knew what we would be getting for that i wouldn’t have paid more then £300 and i’m being generous with that amount. I have had premier inn rooms that have been way nicer. So to start the weekend of the receptionist wasn’t very friendly just checked us in and left us to it. She didn’t even check properly that we had already pre paid and argued with me about paying the full balance until i showed her the email. We got the king deluxe room, nothing special about it and the bathtub was dirty. Found numerous hairs around the tub. I did have a decent sleep the first half of the night but then around 5am was woken up…"
1529,Hope Street Hotel,"This is a fabulous hotel, well appointed with just the best staff. For our mini break in the ‘pool we couldn’t have chosen better. Super comfortable bed and an excellent breakfast. Has a great little gym to boot! Light, modern and airy, we really had no complaints."
1530,Hope Street Hotel,Despite staying with them previously when we asked for an upgrade we didn’t get it. Overall the hotel is okay. The staff in the 1931 restaurant are friendly. The hotel is clean but can be noisy with conference rooms on the top floor.
1531,Hope Street Hotel,"This is one of those contemporary/minimalist hotels, that is both very expensive and almost trying too hard and failing in several areas. Check-in was a huge problem, with 30 minute+ delay, due to them confusing and switching two pre-bookings made weeks before. Eventually it was sorted, and they very kindly gave us all a free drinks voucher. The reception area, restaurant and bars are all very nicely appointed. But the rooms not so much, with hard wood floors, cheap desk and cupboard, but worse, bed bases with exposed edges that can painfully catch your feet or calves. The bathroom was OK, but the tap switches for for the shower or bath were confusing and slightly broken in our room. Very expensive overnight cost (London prices) and no Spa (£45 extra each!) and no breakfast…"
1532,Hope Street Hotel,"The extraordinary Hope Street Hotel lies near the mid-point of the historic road that connects the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals of the great city of Liverpool. Anyone even mildly familiar with the history of the City will recognize Hope Street and the Hotel itself as a poignant symbol of both the great foundations and future prospects of the region. The hotel itself is beautifully contemporary and contains all updated amenities one would expect of a leading venue for both business and leisure. The hotel staff provides excellent service from booking through to check-in, stay and checkout, and each member seems extraordinarily well versed in the life of the City. While there, I hosted an early dinner for several friends in the Hotel’s London Carriage Works…"
1533,Hope Street Hotel,"We were looking forward to our one night at the hotel but it sadly fell short of our expectations in a number of ways. The room (twin deluxe) was very basic, light flooded the room in the morning from around the curtains, the towels whilst clean were well used having pulls and loose threads hanging off, toiletries were sparce (no soap provided), no area to sit and do hair and make-up comfortably, the wet-room style shower sprayed water all over the floor / toilet. I have stayed in a high number of 4* & 5* hotels all over the world and I was disappointed with the standard of the room. Breakfast however was lovely, great choices available, plentiful and served by very pleasant staff. Shame that I was unable to make my overall rating higher."
1534,Hope Street Hotel,"Hope Street Hotel is a lovely relaxed place to stay, and is ideally positioned for walking around the city, visiting the various great bars and restaurants - and for visiting our son studying at the University of Liverpool."
1535,Hope Street Hotel,Great location. Very friendly staff. Room was well equipped and beds bedding and pillows very comfortable. Hotel had a couple of restaurants we ate at 1931 their Italian but it was very good and reasonable value. A few really nice restaurants opposite for breakfast or lunch too.
1536,Hope Street Hotel,"A short stay after spending the weekend at the Grand National. We were celebrating friends silver wedding anniversary. The hotel added some chocolates to their room on arrival. Our rooms had a brilliant view of the skyline down towards the river. Location of the hotel is great, close to Bold street for so many restaurants. We had drinks in The Carriage bar in the hotel, service was great and well priced. The highlight of our stay was the Thermal journey experience in the Spa, fantastic space, with a number of different saunas steam room tepidarium and pools."
1537,Hope Street Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel, in walking distance of main attractions & with welcoming staff. My room was very comfortable, well furnished but the huge bathroom was very cold. I had to keep the door shut because it made the bedroom chilly. I would however happily return if I visit Liverpool again."
1538,Hope Street Hotel,"Found this little gem after a not so great experience last April. So glad we did, from the moment we checked in we were made to feel nothing was too much trouble. Two lovely girls on the reception on Wednesday 12th April, sorry we didn’t get your names. Great at directing for parking and helping with luggage! Breakfast each day was lovely and plenty of selection with cereals, croissants and hot food available. The team were happy to do custom orders too if required. They always checked if you were okay too which is always great! Bar service was also fab, again checking on you if you needed more drinks and reasonably priced. We dined off the bar menu and the club sandwich and the fillet steak sandwich were divine! Rooms were all very different but spotless and fabulously…"
1539,Hope Street Hotel,Really good location in an upgraded part of Liverpool. Modern and well appointed with two restaurants for different styles. room comfortable and light. Only downside is parking which is best done at the Cathedral carpark. Make sure you drop your bags off before parking.
1540,Hope Street Hotel,We had the best time for my boyfriends 25th Birthday . the hotel was amazing with setting up the room for us . i dropped presents off and balloons & they set it all up gorgeous for us ! we stayed 2 nights & went out the 1st night & then done the spa and ordered food in the second the spa was gorgeous very relaxing ! the people were lovely so all in all everything was fab ! the only parts i would say was that the room we stayed in was small for a king deluxe room we was expecting abit bigger also the hotel is very loud when we was sitting there all night you could hear people walking up and down & slamming doors i jumped a couple of times 🤣 we would return again as the hotel is gorgeous & is close to everything we needed but they was the only cons xx
1541,Hope Street Hotel,"A special thank you to all the staff who helped to ensure that my son was able to deliver an amazing surprise engagement for his girlfriend. From start to finish the hotel was professional, helpful and discreet They kept in touch to ensure that all our requirements were met . Big thank you !! Needless to say the roof top room was exceptional !!"
1542,Hope Street Hotel,"This is our second time at Hope Street Hotel and it’s just perfect. The beds are very comfortable and very friendly helpful staff in the hotel and spa. The spa facilities are beautiful, the breakfast is fantastic and it just makes our weekend trip away even better . We look forward to visit again."
1543,Hope Street Hotel,"Amazing hotel! Stayed for two nights and had a Sunday roast in the restaurant before we left, couldn’t fault it. Everything was within walking distance and the spa and gym was incredible, I’d highly recommend it."
1544,Hope Street Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, lovely decor, perfect location! Have stayed a couple of times, the rooms are all so unique and wonderfully designed. Staff are super friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The hotel has a spa which is really relaxing, I would 100% recommend! There are also two onsite restaurants, an Italian and fine dining, both have a different feel and the food is lush! Overall, I had a wonderful stay and can't wait to return :-D"
1545,Hope Street Hotel,"Recently stayed at hope street hotel and had the best time. All of the staff we came across were very friendly and caring, they couldn't do enough for us. Our room was lovely and clean, we originally had plans to go out but ended up staying in the room the whole night and ordered room service from their in house restaurant (which was also great) We will definitely be returning without hesitation and I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
1546,Hope Street Hotel,Really not the best start. When I booked the hotel I had a really lovely chat with the manager who said he would give me a great room/view etc. when we came to check in it turns out that manager left and the front of house couldn’t give a xxx about honouring any of that. Within 10 mins of being in our room I lay on the bed exhausted from travelling all day and noticed hairs. A lot of curly dark hairs and also what looked like eyelashes/eyebrow hairs. Definitely not mine. I phoned reception and politely asked them to change bedsheets which they did with an apology. I expected more actually as I found it disgusting. We then left the hotel and went out to dinner. Came back looking forward to a bath and noticed the towels were stained. Phoned down again to ask for clean towels.…
1547,Hope Street Hotel,"I came here for business and was pleased to find that the room was clean and comfortable, and noise wasn't an issue. However, having just recovered from food poisoning before my visit, on my last day I asked for some breakfast items from the room service menu in the restaurant, rather than the buffet as lots of that was oily food. There was quite a to do about this despite my seeing other guests make similar orders during my stay. They eventually allowed me to order something but when my breakfast arrived, the avocado was brown and stringy, the poached eggs were almost raw, and the bread was processed and tasteless. It made me feel ill. Fine, I thought, it's still a nice enough hotel. However, on checking out, the reception staff told me I had a £30 bill to settle. I had not…"
1548,Hope Street Hotel,"Fantastic, loved every minute! I stayed here with my boyfriend but arrived a few hours before him on my own and the staff were so friendly and personable, especially one of the male staff members (which I am super sad to have not remembered his name!). We went to the spa the next day which was also WONDERFUL. Thank you :)"
1549,Hope Street Hotel,"Beautifully designed hotel, gorgeous spa with 2 saunas, steam room, pool and outside jacuzzi (plus amazing massage), delicious breakfast, friendly staff, and great location. Couldn't ask for more for my 40th birthday night away and would definitely come back!"
1550,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Really lovely hotel, the only issue was that we booked a deluxe room and paid for one. On arrival we we're told we couldn't have that room as it has carpet in and wr had a small dog with us (when booked said dog friendly) We were given a back room facing the car park (with no carpet) Then had to pay £25 to leave our car in the hotels car park for two nights!! You would think after paying to stay at the hotel the car park would be included!! Saying the above we did like the hotel, pool was nice, games room was good and loved the quiz night, great host. Hotel is near Bournemouth town and beach /pier. Just disappointed after paying for a deluxe room and not getting it. Our dog is house trained and never makes a mess indoors."
1551,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Such a lovely welcoming hotel! A fantastic smiley team, nothing is too much trouble. Our room was excellent, lovely decor, a comfy bed and a great shower. We had breakfast and dinner, both were excellent and reasonably priced. A good central location with plenty of onsite parking. All together highly recommend."
1552,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","I paid for a room upgrade. We were put in a so called Signature Room. If this was an upgrade, I wouldn't want to stay in an 'ordinary' room. The en-suite was extremely small and the extractor seemed to be inoperative. The toilet was tucked behind the door and had to be approached sideways if you wished to avoid banging elbows on the door handle. Everything was clean and tidy however."
1553,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We had an excellent lunch experience on Sunday and were treated to lovely food and wonderfully friendly service. We are local and not hotel guests but rather just booked a table for lunch as it was my wife’s birthday. Having not stepped foot in the hotel before we didn’t really have any expectations although the website promises much. The decor and overall ambiance of the hotel is excellent, it has a modern and friendly feel, welcoming yet also elegant. We had the Sunday roast menu and were served in good time for all courses. The food was excellent and the roasted vegetable medley was a tasty alternative to the usual boiled boring sides that are often served elsewhere. Our server Jessica was the perfect blend of friendly professionalism and attentive but not intrusive. Although…"
1554,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We enjoyed our stay here, so many pluses! Beautifully decorated and clean. Warm and friendly staff who obviously enjoy their work. A lovely modern and comfortable room. A very nice pool, jacuzzi and sauna. Great food and amazing cocktails! Also the location is so close to the beach and centre of town. Our kids loved it, we plan to return in the summer!"
1555,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","The hotel itself is lovely, but don’t expect a nice warm welcoming or good people skills from the staff. Couldn’t find a spare room key let me waiting for hours while someone was fast asleep in my room. They were blunt and had no empathy"
1556,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","My wife and I stayed at this lovely hotel as part of a weekend away with a male voice choir that I sing with. Our room was on the first floor and was spacious, comfortable and with a sea view, albeit down a side street opposite. It was only a five minute walk to the sea front and lovely gardens and shops were within a short distance. The food was lovely, the staff were very obliging and the bar area and staff were nice too. It is deserving of more than its 3 star rating. We would definitely stay there again."
1557,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","42 of us from the Mansfield and District Male Voice Choir, went to Hotel Collingwood for a 2 night stay to perform at some concerts. All said the food was excellent and very well presented, the staff were very helpful and friendly, the hotel and rooms were very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff catered very well for this large party, nothing was too much trouble. Would gladly recommend and stay at this hotel again, its location was close to beach and all amenities."
1558,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We stayed for three nights over Easter as part of a group. Our room was quite small but clean and well decorated. The food in the restaurant was excellent as was the service, and the bar staff we friendly and helpful. Car parking was easily accessible and it is in a good location, handy for the beach and local bus services. Would recommend. The only complaint would be that we weren’t told room service was not automatic when we checked in and our room lacked the sign to put on the door to as for the room to be serviced so it was a bit of a surprise on day one to discover the room in the state we had left it in the morning. However this was soon rectified."
1559,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Fabulous hotel, our room was well appointed, staff very friendly and helpful with humour at times which was very refreshing, nothing was too much trouble, very obliging. The swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna were lovely, changing room with shower excellent. The Hotel is close to the main bus routes and a few minutes walk from the seafront and gardens. We can certainly recommend this Hotel. We will be returning for another stay. Thank you Team Collingwood."
1560,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We have stopped at the Collingwood hotel for the last 5 years for 3 night week end break This year I booked 8 rooms as we are a walking group from the Cotswolds, it is very convenient for the town or where ever we want to go. The staff are always very obliging and a friendly lot, we always book B B & evening meal as the food is very delicious and always piping hot, rooms are always spotlessly clean another good point is a very large car park at the rear. Dave C"
1561,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","A return visit after a break of 5 + yrs.Hotel has been completely refurbished to a high standard.The room was clean,tidy and well maintained. The restaurant served very tasty breakfasts with a good variety. Something for everyone. The evening meals were very tasty and also an option of bar meals as an alternative."
1562,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",I spent three nights at this hotel for a conference. My overall stay and experience was lovely. Staff were both courteous and polite and attentive the options for breakfast and quality of the food were good serving staff and bar staff lovely. My room was large bed comfortable bathroom and shower nice. All very clean. Can’t complain at all…
1563,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Fantastic stay at the Hotel Collingwood!! Everything was spot on and breakfast was piping hot!! The decor was fresh and clean, staff friendly and polite, Thomas really looked after us at the bar all night!"
1564,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Clean, well decorated and well positioned, 2min walk to the sea (pier 5min walk). Lovely staff, service and excellent food. Room (upgraded to superior) was a bit of a disappointment.. modern but quite cramped, particularly the ensuite, where the shower was little more than a dribble (2nd floor). Whilst (small double) bed itself was comfy, sleep quality was compromised by lengthy squeaking of floorboards from above, and hearing every noise from next door, every cough, snore, pulling drawers in & out etc."
1565,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","I choose this hotel due to its location, decor and facilities for teens - pool and games room. The hotel exceeded my expectations, the rooms were beautifully decorated, food was amazing and staff were helpful and polite. Couldn’t fault our stay will definitely return !"
1566,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","I must thank the event manager, Marika and all the hard-working staff for looking after our group so well and making us all so welcome on our three night break over the Easter weekend. There were 47 of us but we were all cheerfully greeted and checked in at reception on Good Friday and directed to the secure cycle store; big enough to take all of our bikes. Help was offered if we needed it to carry luggage and any minor issues with rooms swiftly sorted out. Then we had time for a swim in the good-sized pool or a sauna or jacuzzi before assembling for a pre-dinner drink in the bar. Dinner for our group was 3-courses with 3-choices for each course followed by tea or coffee. The helpful restaurant staff catered very efficiently for our group. All the meals were excellent and as a…"
1567,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",Excellent hotel with first class staff - Kota and Thomas in restaurant and bar gave great service- swimming pool great with games room with table tennis pool and table football- food was very good in restaurants but drinks a little pricey- lost a point with knocking radiators on the second night which woke the whole first floor waking me every half hour to fiddle with rads / disappointing but an old building but No compensation forthcoming- considering we spent nearly £400 in bar and restaurant over two days feel a little aggrieved but wouldn’t stop me returning
1568,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Best quality hotel I have experienced in a long time. The facilities are lovely decorated, the hotel is clean and well looked after. Staff was really helpful and paid loads of attention to detail. I would highlight their breakfast as delicious, varied and freshly made to order! This is rare to find nowadays! The quality of the food is tops and we truly enjoyed our stay! Thank you"
1569,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","I always find fault with hotels and if I had to be very pedantic I would say the lift was slow. There's a games room and I have added a photo but we didn't use it. There's a fantastic pool, that we didn't use, but when we saw it (11 April '23) it was empty and looked amazing. We stayed in room 215 which had a sea view (see photo) but not a great sea view. Everything in the room worked and the beds were good, everything in the bathroom was good including the towels which were large and fluffy and everything working, WIFI was good and free. The bar service was cheery and easy as was the service in the dining room. Peter from Poland did an amazing job at dinner as did Jessica who served us at Breakfast today (12 April). The dinner was excellent and well priced and todays full…"
1570,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",From the minute we walked in we were impressed with the chic decor. All Reception staff very welcoming and accommodating throughout our stay. Our granchildren loved the spacious family room and all the facilities of which we took advantage of. Breakfast was yummy too although there was a little delay again the staff delivered great customer service.
1571,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Very good location, really close to the restaurants and beach , poor breakfast nothing healthy to choose from the manu just heavy food . In the bar really good quality of alcohol. Dirty and smelly carpets"
1572,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Stayed at this hotel as part of a large group of cyclists and it could not have been better! How this hotel only has 3 stars surprises me as the food and waiting staff were exemplary as were the cocktails and bar staff. The hotel was spotless, with lovely lounge, restaurant and bar areas, and the leisure facilities: small pool, sauna and jacuzzi were great after a day’s cycling. There was even safe cycle storage provided! Rooms were nice and clean, warm with a comfy bed and good space between twin beds. It was a good location, near the pier and very reasonable with free evening entertainment provided by local singers and musicians. The hotel couldn’t have done more and I didn’t want for more as had it all! Thank you everyone."
1573,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We went to the Collingwood Hotel’s Gold Room restaurant for Easter Sunday lunch and it did not disappoint. Great service, reasonably priced menu, delicious food - the lamb was superb, and a good understanding of gluten free needs. Will definitely be going back"
1574,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","From start to finish, our stay was wonderful! Our room was spacious and had an incredible sea view with a short walk to the pier. The entire staff were friendly and made us feel very welcome. Food was incredible and very tasty. The pool facilities were a huge plus which we thoroughly enjoyed. We definitely will be back in the future."

1576,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","A lovely hotel, close to all Bournemouth has to offer. Beach 5 mins and town 10 mins away. We booked direct with the hotel and had free parking, early check in and a rate that included breakfast. Well worth it. We stayed in room 215 which was a lovely room for 2 adults and a 12yr old with a sea view. Room clean, with tea, coffee and biscuits. Bed very comfy. Air con in room, a shower with good hot water. Pool, sauna and hot tub - fab after walking to Sandbanks in the morning. Breakfast was just fabulous. Buffet fruit, yoghurt, juice, toast and a menu to order hot food. The Dorset breakfast was very very good. All served hot and service was first class with local produce. Shout out to Jessica who was a fabulous waitress, kind and welcoming and remembered what we’d eaten the…"
1577,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Our third visit to the Collingwood and really enjoyed our short stay. The hotel is in a good position. Made to feel welcome and even had our room ready earlier than expected. We took advantage of the lovely swimming pool and jacuzzi. We only stayed on a bed and breakfast basis, the breakfast being excellent with a good choice. Our room was clean and nicely decorated with a clean, modern shower en-suite. New fluffy towels. Very important for me was a large car park, something not always available at some other Bournemouth hotels. Staff throughout pleasant, attentive and helpful. I will recommend you to my friends."
1578,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",Not happy about paying for parking should be free for guests 12 pound a day broken window catch letting all the noise in so couldn’t sleep 🤔 but hotel clean and very nice room well done out rooms Nice decor
1579,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Absolutely excellent hotel. Superb service, good location, delicious food. Friendly and welcoming with staff that were cheerful, polite and helpful, especially in the restaurant. I thoroughly recommend this hotel."
1580,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We have stayed at this hotel 3 times now and just like the whole experience of the hotel, from excellent service, good food to the indoor swimming pool and the location, a 10-15 minute walk brings you to the town centre and similar to the beach, generally down hill to and uphill back. The hotel also has a decent private car park so no hunting for street parking if you have a car. The clientele tends to be over 60s but can easily be a nice stay for any age traveller. Would we stay here again, most DEFIANTLY"
1581,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",We had a single night with dinner and breakfast. Everywhere looked stylish and everywhere was clean. The room was very conformable and the food (breakfast especially) was excellent. 10 minute walk to the pier (15 back as its up hill!).
1582,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Today I went to a baby shower at Hotel Collingwood. I paid £21.50 for an afternoon tea. Me and another person were served 1 vegan portion between 2 of us. When we queried it we were told ‘no that’s for 2 people’ Then when we asked another person they said ‘we were only told 1 vegan was coming’ They didn’t try to accommodate us whatsoever. So for £21.50 I had half a sandwich, half a scone and 2 tiny cake bite things. Also, the bites tasted like they had been stored with garlic or something . Not good. Really bad customer service. It’s a shame, the place seemed nice but to be fobed off after paying that much I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
1583,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Really lovely hotel. Very clean hotel in all areas. Room spotless. The room we had booked wasn’t quite right for us but we changed with no issues and were upgraded free of charge. Thank you. Swimming pool was lovely for us as a family as it was empty of any other guests! Close to town so short walk! Perfect. Only things we would have changed, hotel was very hot and we were very hot overnight so had to have the windows open! Pool showers do not work which meant a walk in towels with two small children back to the room!!"
1584,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",another great stay at the collingwood nothing is to much trouble always very calm we will be back again soon the food is first class and allways served hot with pleanty to pick from the menue inc a good wine list
1585,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Great hotel, close to everything. The family suite was perfect and meant the kids had their own room so we could watch TV after they had gone to bed. The hotel is super clean and the staff are all friendly and helpful. Pool could do with being a bit warmer but we still enjoyed it. Mattress was a bit hard a topper would have helped me but my husband slept like a log and aid he liked it so it’s definitely personal preference not an issue with the beds."
1586,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We enjoyed an excellent 3 night stay at the Collingwood. Our room was spotless, a very comfortable bed and an excellent shower. Lovely decoration throughout the hotel. Best of all was the food, lots of choice and all freshly cooked. The staff are always friendly and helpful, a great bunch obviously happy at work. Breakfast was freshly cooked, hot and plentiful. The location is perfect for all that Bournemouth has to offer. We hope to return later this year as we had such a lovely time."
1587,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Booked a night away for my partner and I through secret escapes, upon arrival the receptionist who was friendly told me that they did not have my booking. My partner and I went back to the car while I contacted secret escapes, after around 10-15 minutes they had the booking, I was charged £50 for a pre authorisation, I asked if that would be a credit to the room and if I could charge drinks to the room and then that £50 would cover what was charged, I was told that is how it would work. we went to the room which was on the third floor. When using the elevator the doors were very slow to open and close, the elevator was quite creaky but was definitely better than using the stairs. Upon entering the room my first thought was the bed was quite small compared to other hotels I’ve…"
1588,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Absolutely wonderful! The dual aspect room was light, bright and airy. The shower room was pristine, new and sparkly clean with lovely sea kelp toiletries. The dinner was piping hot and freshly cooked. Innovative cuisine. Breakfast was amazing. Certainly not the tired, dried up buffet to be found in so many hotels, but an extensive cooked -to- order menu. I had yummy avocados on peanut butter on sourdough… The staff were lovely, - bright and cheerful despite being on duty late the night before. Everywhere was super clean and attractive. The location is very close to the seafront and we had a bracing walk on the pier before dinner. Our last visit to the area was one night at the Poole Quay Hotel for £265, which was absolutely chaotic and appalling. We were totally ignored in…"
1589,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","If you’re lucky enough to have a room with a comfortable bed (I wasn’t) Hotel Collingwood is a nice place to stay, including a very good restaurant where staff go the extra mile. Service in other parts of the hotel could be better. Help with locating the car park would have saved me 30minutes stress driving round in the dark in circles as my Satnav couldn’t find Priory Road. Great to have a swimming pool on site; some fresh towels would have been welcome."
1590,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","We stayed here for a few days with our small dog.Having read the reviews first it was ideal for us. Lovely welcome from receptionist and a gift bag for our dog 🐶 great plus ! We were booked in a ground floor family room which was a really nice freshly decorated room. Walk in shower and separate toilet ,nice towels and decor. Totally impressed our dog was allowed anywhere except for the main restaurant.We were able to sit in the bubble bar for meals with our dog which is a great social space.Definitely dog friendly. We ate from the bar menu for evening meals and paid for breakfast ,food was well cooked and hot.Very reasonable priced. There is also a very well stocked bar. All the staff were a credit to the hotel ,very friendly and happy. Can highly recommend this hotel and…"
1591,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","I visited with my children for a mini-break at half term. Overall the hotel was fine, but there were issues with the pool which spoiled our experience. We had booked this hotel specifically because it had a pool and found out by accident that the pool was being redecorated in the lead up to our stay and they coudn't guarentee the pool would be open. I called several times in advance of our stay to check on progress with the pool and was told it would 'probably' be ready for our arrival. In the end, the decorators were still finishing and the pool was still heating up on our first day. On the second day, we had been in the (still quite cold) pool for about 10 minutes when a lady arrived to set up a party and we had to leave the pool early. There were no notices to indicate that…"
1592,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",very good customer services hotel very clean rooms nice and clean food very good breakfast and dinner nice and hot food on hot plates nice swiming pool and games room only problem it as a staep hillback from town
1593,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Such a lovely warm and friendly hotel! The décor is high standard, lots to look at and enjoy. The bar is excellent, well stocked and staffed, lovely cocktails! Our room was spotless with a very comfortable large bed, we had a great sleep. The breakfast was cooked to order and delicious. Very good for parking and central to the beach and town. We visit Bournemouth often and will stay here again."
1594,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Having read all of the fantastic reviews of this hotel, I was very excited for our stay at Hotel Collingwood. Unfortunately, the experience my family and I had was far from the brilliant stays previously reviewed. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were told we would have to pay £12.50 to keep our car in the car park overnight. We have since learnt that this is a policy the hotel has in place for bookings through a third-party website and it is listed in the small print. However, the staff couldn't have been more rude/dismissive when we questioned the extortionate price, explaining 'you can go and park down the street but you'll be lucky if you get a space.' We accepted the £12.50, took our keys (which are on a ridiculously large key ring) and went to our rooms. Again, incredibly…"
1595,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Had a lovely afternoon tea.at Collingwood Hotel All sandwiches, cakes & scones were very fresh. Large pot of hot coffee. Staff came round to check every thing was okay. Very comfortable seating. Would highly recommend"
1596,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western",Best hotel I've ever stayed in in Bournemouth by far!!!! The room was lovely and clean we all had a great nights sleep. The food was very nice and catered very well to my daughters allergies. The bar was great and the kids loved the games room. Definitely will be coming back in the summer and we cannot wait!
1597,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Excellent hotel with great facilities and lovely, friendly staff! We had a great family room, lots of space for everyone, comfy beds and a lovely bathroom. We had breakfast and dinner in the restaurant, the food was outstanding and the service just perfect. Excellent for families at half term, we plan to return later this year and bring friends."
1598,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","Having read the great reviews of the hotel, my family and I booked to stay. For the amount we paid for one night, I feel like I’ve been robbed! £12.50 per day/night for parking on top on arrival UNLESS you book directly with the hotel, which seems completely unfair (this is on the website, but should be made clearer) The rooms were clean, but the beds were so uncomfortable, rooms far too too hot even with radiators turned off, unable to open the windows due to noise. My sister got locked in the bathroom due to faulty and poor lock. The room we was given was located under a staircase and you could hear everything single steps when someone was using the stairs as loud as if it was in the room!! My family had the same experience in their rooms. Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in in…"
1599,"Hotel Collingwood, Sure Hotel Collection by Best Western","I arrive at the hotel after booking through booking.com. on arrival I was given my key as builders were busy working in the hotel, I was asked for my breakfast choice for the following morning which I gave. Once in the room the room was freezing,window open and no heating on, i went back to reception only to be told the heating was on a timer but they turned on anyway. 2030 that night heating switched off and within 1 hour it was freezing again, I ended up sleeping in a jumper Arriving for breakfast, new receptionist, no one knew I was coming I was shown to a dinning room but had to sit at the bar as the receptionist couldn't get the lights on, breakfast finally arrived but as I eat the builder we're carrying rubbish out behind me , literally 1m behind me. Then they couldn't…"
1600,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Perfect hotel, nice room, good location and well trained staff, stay went like clockwork, plenty of car parking places available as I had to drive as there was a train strike. Visit was to see Peter kay at the O2 Arena, can actually see the O2 from the hotel albeit on the other side of the Thames."
1601,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Hotel is fabulous. Room was clean and well equipped. Bathroom was clean. Close to 2 DLR stations connecting with underground. Hotel team were terrific & really helpful. Close to 02. Our trip was fantastic. Would definitely recommend this hotel.
1602,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","The team were friendly from the moment we arrived and service was great. Location was ok for a trip to the O2. There were no coffee making facilities in the room not conditioner for the bath and the temp setting was up at 22 degrees which took a while to cool down so check that first on arrival and adjust! Otherwise, breakfast was good and the hotel was spotlessly clean"
1603,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",It was like staying in an art gallery with various statues. The dinner was a bit expensive in my view but onion soup nice. Room was large. Very clean and modern. Shame unable to walk along the river. Was a bit difficult to get to. Staff were friendly
1604,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Atrocious for parking. The staff are probably picking who they give River views to! Claiming all River view had been booked from months prior. Even though I booked and asked for River view months ago.
1605,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","The hotel is clean, comfortable, with great views of the o2 Arena. The rooms are very nice with comfy beds. The staff are very helpful and keen to assist where they can. The breakfast is very good, with a wide choice to choose from. At lunchtime I had “haddock and chips” which was very good and was a larger portion than expected. The mushy peas not so much. They need a re think! I had one drink in the bar during our evening /one night stay. The bar looks well stocked. The only issue for me was the beer choice was lager or lager and the barman didn’t seem to appreciate my slight frustration due to a lack of choice. Surely a “Bitter” of some sort should be stocked? So if you want a decent pint, look elsewhere! A good choice hotel and overall a great experience and…"
1606,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Issues with payment not accepting Maestro debit card neither with online payment. Not accepting transfer neither. Issues with the key not working any night. Breakfast and restaurant views are good and nice. Beds are comfortable. Bathroom is big with shower and bathtub though not enough light to put on make up.
1607,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","A beautiful, secure, hotel with really friendly staff. Our room was really spacious filled with every amenity you could wish for over looking the Thames and O2. We enjoyed a few drinks in the bar which was lovely and the menu looked great. Didn't have breakfast at £25 per head. With the cost of the room you'd think it would be included."
1608,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","The hotel room was spotless, spacious and super comfy. The check-in was effortless and the staff were friendly and helpful. Great location for the o2. The hotel lobby was impressive. Bed was perfect, had a great sleep. Was definitely great value"
1609,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Stayed here for a friend's 40th for access to the O2. Very clean, comfortable hotel. Staff were extremely attentive, welcoming and friendly throughout our stay. The food in the restaurant was gorgeous with a very nice view over the Thames."
1610,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Radisson Blu New Providence Wharf hotel was clean, comfortable with friendly staff. However what they fail to mention is you are a 25 minute taxi or train ride away from the I2. We had to pay £50 in return taxi fares. When I booked details said hotel was 0.93km away from the O2 unless you can swim across it’s a lot further away than that!"
1611,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Great decor and stylish but needs to improve on their breakfast varieties. Shower closet needs to be bigger. There needs to be microwave available for the guests. Shops for convenience need to be on the property.
1612,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Room and staff great , can’t fault the food. A lot of construction around the building, awkward to find initially. Room service needs improving. Ordered an early breakfast before early checkout but it failed to show up , bit disappointed in that as we had prepaid for breakfast. Overall a good hotel."
1613,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Truly good London UK hotel Large clean room Very good breakfast Very helpful and nice reception staff Especially the local East End guy Good view from the breakfast restaurant Very large bathroom, clean with both shower and bath tub Nice and clean bedroom with a large bed and good lighting A really good Radisson Blu experince as always"
1614,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Fantastic helpful staff I believe the man is called Rob, From the second I arrived I was looked after,I have never been looked after so well in a hotel in my life I would recommend this hotel to all The staff are amazing they are a credit to the hotel"
1615,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Stayed at this hotel for 1 night for a concert at the O2. Very easy check in opted for the valet parking which is a lovely addition as trying to park your car in an area you don’t know can be very difficult and frustrating Room was lovely. Large and very clean Bed was very comfy. Lots of amenities in the bathroom and even a welcome card. Which was a lovely touch Breakfast was plentiful. Had the buffet. Amazing but you can also order more specific items from a menu Shame we didn’t get there earlier on check in day as would have loved to have used the spa but London traffic put a stop to that Thanks for making our Stay enjoyable
1616,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Paid on booking.com and a couple of days later I was charged for the room again, leaving me in a difficult position financially, being nearly £250 out of pocket, told it could take up to five working days for the refund. Shocking really."
1617,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Great location, spacious and clean rooms, very comfy bed, car par on site, best breakfast we had, lovely and welcoming staff. We really enjoyed our stay and will be back for sure next time we visit London. Highly recomending."
1618,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","The hotel overall is fine. Extravagant and posh. However, I found the beds to be extremely firm, the headboard of the bed covered in dust..what appeared to be paint stains/nail varnish of some description stained on the carpet upon entering the room and also a lot of road noise in our room on the 5th floor. (Might be different depending where in the hotel you are) I prepaid the hotel room days before arrival and was charged the same rate again upon self checkout without being made aware which has been a massive inconvenience given the price paid for the room. The Wi-Fi would not connect even after numerous attempts I ended up using mobile data! To summarise - Location - Good for the o2 and shopping around Canary Wharf. Cleanliness - Okay, the hotel overall appeared clean…"
1619,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","The receptionist Barbara handled all our queries and She was very helpful and kind. Everything was perfect. Comfortable beds, large rooms, modern and clean. When I come back to London it will be my first choice. THANK YOU BARBARA For your kind treatment that gave us more happiness in the hotel 🫶🏽"
1620,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Lovely hotel very clean food was delicious staff was welcoming will definitely stay again I love this as a first time to London was worth the wait thank you for having you we look forward to seeing you again
1621,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","It was a perfect stay, everything I could’ve asked for, and not much really could’ve made the stay better. The dining was excellent and the facilities were amazing and cleanliness not only in the room but the whole hotel was exceptional."
1622,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","This is a nice hotel. Room was nice, although building work was ongoing outside our window and the windows were every dirty as a result. To be expected I suppose. Room very clean and bathroom well equipped. Comfortable good sized bed. Negatives : nowhere really to hang clothes, no biscuits or complimentary water which for the price I was disappointed were missing. Safe had low battery so couldn’t use. Breakfast really expensive. The reason though for my relatively low rating though is the absolute fuss made over our decision to have breakfast at the hotel. We weren’t about to run away without paying, but that was the inference by the fact that we were hassled - three times by two members of staff at the table after we said we’d pay on checking out, which was embarrassing and…"
1623,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Great option for staying in London. Perfectly clean hotel, great breakfast, not big variety, but has all necessary food, also - alternative milk products for lactose intolerance. Loved the room. Would stay again, highly recommend"
1624,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Stayed for a concert at the 02. Staff went out of their way to make it special for my friend’s birthday. The breakfast was also amazing! The valet parking service worked well. The room was clean, and there was no noise, which is rare!"
1625,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Very clean, very polite, friendly and helpful staff. Prosecco on arrival is a really nice touch, made you feel special as you walked in. Lovely room and really liked the little touches such as robes, cotton pads, cotton buds and flannels. Breakfast was lovely, loved the variety and the addition of the a la carte option too."
1626,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Nice hotel. Bit of a jaunt to the DLR. nothing really around the hotel. Quite expensive and I would have thought the breakfast should have been k clouded but that was extra. Could only afford one night.
1627,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Very nice hotel and great customer services. Fantastic facilities.. I was impressed by the cleanliness, quality of the beds, furniture, bathroom, and also great customer service. I would highly recommend this hotel to family, friends colleagues."
1628,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Hotel is lovely although I think better suited to business than leisure The breakfast is ok but expensive especially if vegetarian, seems close to o2 as you can see it, but is still two DLR changes or a taxi The price had also been increased due to the London marathon"
1629,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Lovely hotel, bit hard to find but lovely view and location. Staff very very helpful, in room food and bottle of wine 🍷 delivered quickly and efficiently. Comfy beds and twin room request met. Easy check in and check out!"
1630,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","The room was clean and bed was comfortable, staff were comfortable and professional. Breakfast was excellent. We stayed to go to a concert at the O2, staff gave directions. We found going via DLR to cable car easiest. Blackwall or east India DLR stations are closest to hotel."
1631,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Radisson is lovely hotel, staff were first class, hotel lovely and clean. Scoff and Banter food reasonable and very good quality. Beware of the surrounding building works. Great location to get to 02 and back again as it a short walk from East India dlr"
1632,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",The hotel is positioned opposite the O2 arena and offers great views across the Thames. Facilities are very good and both the bar and restaurant were pleasant places to spend time. The position of the hotel is a little bit away from Canary Wharf and other City attractions but is in a quiet area of the River. It may prove a little remote for some. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom was particularly good. The offering for dinner in the restaurant is a little narrow but we dined there on three occasions and we’re very pleased with the quality and price. Overall we enjoyed our stay.
1633,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Bad room cleanliness, not great poor finishing to room. A lot of charges on top of drink prices service charge but poor service. Check in was quick. Staff hotel decent, but staff in bath and restaurant poor"
1634,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Exceptional building with the latest state of art of equipment. Sensational views and even better in the night . Cleanliness of the building was impeccable not of inch of dust was found . The hotel was very accessible
1635,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","This must be one of the best hotels I’ve ever stayed at. Everything is absolutely lovely about it. The location, the view, the rooms, the food, the bar and the decor. It makes a work trip worthwhile when you can stay in such a nice place to rest."
1636,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Excellent stay with friendly and professional staff. The cleanliness of the hotel is very good. The breakfast is good and the bar is well stocked with a variety of drinks choices. The reception staff are very welcoming.
1637,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","A perfect stay! Will certainly be coming back. The bed was sooooo comfortable. Food was great, staff were so friendly and the hotel was spotlessly clean. Will be trying out the spa on our next visit thats for sure."
1638,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","I’ve stayed at this hotel three times and found the team working here to be very accommodating. They have often gone out of their way to help us. It’s almost a secret being off the beaten track and sitting on the banks of the Thames overlooking the O2. Tonight is the first night we have eaten in the restaurant and I have to say the food is “special” - absolutely first class - no need to look elsewhere! Starter, main course and dessert - all exceptionally well presented and full of flavour. Just sit by the window and enjoy the view, great company and some wonderful wine too. Would definitely recommend."
1639,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Fantastic hotel, room was huge, as was bathroom, and both perfectly clean. Amenities were great, bed very comfortable, room service food was delicious and well priced. We had a minor issue with a leaky coffemaker that was promptly resolved for us. It was a little tucked away so we initially got lost finding it but that shouldn't discourage visitors."
1640,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",Room and bed very comfortable. Dripping taps all night. No mirror at dresser. Breakfast good other than staff not speaking much English. Waited 20 minutes for coffee. £295 for one night and then charged an additional £25 for parking bit of a liberty!
1641,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London",We stayed here for the second time when attending an event at the o2. It's easy to get to and from the o2 from this hotel. The rooms are clean and spacious with lovely shower/bathroom facilities. The staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel feels safe and it relatively quiet.
1642,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Cannot fault the service from the staff in all departments. Efficient, courteous and helpful all with happy faces. Greeting as we entered the hotel was fast, also gave us the best directions to get to and from the O2. We were offered a glass of champers as a welcome drink. A lovely touch. I'd definatly use Radisson again."
1643,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","spacious room, spotlessly clean, plenty of toiletries massive, comfy bed, a mirror adjacent to the hairdryer (doesn't happen very often!) ironing board, fridge, bottled water tea and coffee machine. perfect!"
1644,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Excellent hotel, service, staff,cleanliness, restaurant and bar, breakfast, lovely location with lovely view of the Thames and just across the river from the O2 building, would be a great feature if there were ferries servicing from hotel to 02 as I was not fond of the DLR/TUBE stations"
1645,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","We loved this hotel, the room was a good size, and the bed really comfortable. The room was very clean with a nice bathroom powerful shower, and fluffy towels. The hotel was in a great location with easy access to the Docklands Light Railway meaning you can get anywhere in London quickly. There is parking at the hotel but it costs £25 a day, so that isn’t cheap. The hotel is well placed for the 02 arena it only took us 25 minutes on the DLR and Jubilee Line from hotel to the arena entrance. The bar and the restaurant was very nice, from the restaurant there are nice views of the river Thames. All the staff were so friendly and helpful it was a great stay from start to end."
1646,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Stayed for 4 nights in this hotel for attending an Alumini event in London. It is a good 15-20 min walk from the underground station. the hotel seems to provide shuttle service to the station, but not the return, which I never used. Dont go with the expectation to have privileges as a Premium or VIP rewards member. You will get none! Good breakfast and ambience. Quality of service and professionalism was lacking.. One of my worst experiences from a Radisson group hotel though."
1647,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Overall very happy with the stay. Restaurant was nice, food was good if a little on the limited side. Not sure I would stay again as I felt it was a little overpriced for low season. I guess I was paying for the river views."
1648,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Stayed here for my daughters 18th birthday. We were going to the O2. Staff were fantastic. Our flight had been cancelled so we arrived later than expected. Balloons & rose petals, towel swans, cake & card for my daughter was great! Meal in Scoff & Banter was lovely too."
1649,"Radisson Blu Edwardian New Providence Wharf Hotel, London","Fantastic hotel, very welcoming as soon as you enter. They even park your car for you while you check in, glass of prosecco as you check in too. Beautiful rooms, great food and room service. Fantastic location, super comfy beds, will definitely return."
1650,Wilde Aparthotels By Staycity London - Paddington,Apartment was lovely and modern had all the facilities needed. Sweet treats were a nice touch and tea and coffee. The staff were friendly and always helpful. The air conditioning which was much needed was so cool and made the room a perfect temperature.
1651,Wilde Aparthotels By Staycity London - Paddington,Stayed with family including my teenage daughter and 10 year old son The location is great : 7 minute walk from paddington station and 3-4 minutes from edge ware road tube station - that helped a lot as we also took a day tour to Oxford - there is a direct train service from paddington station to Oxford ! The hotel itself is OK : for the amount of money they charge I think the service especially housekeeping should be better.
1652,Wilde Aparthotels By Staycity London - Paddington,"Great apartment hotel in the heart of Paddington. Check in was possible before our visit. We managed to get into our apartment early, a bonus! Perfect location for a Wembley Stadium visit. Great little kitchenette , very well equipped, so we used the big M and S simply food round the corner and had an evening meal in the apartment as well as breakfast. We loved the remote window blind, with far reaching views over the city from the 10th floor. We loved the hospitality of the staff and the basket of goodies waiting for us when we got back from Harry Styles concert. The bathroom had a massive shower head and lots of white thick fluffy towels. There was nothing that could have been improved, except the supply of coffee pods ( 2 instead of the advertised 4) We will be back!"

Staff were extremely helpful and hardworking. However, of particular note, please pass on our thanks to a guy named Elnouby. From the moment we checked in, Elnouby was so helpful and friendly. In particular, he took the time to always suggest where we could visit; whilst arranging our Taxis was never too much bother for him; even when he was clearly very busy. Ever-smiling, he made our stay such a memorable break. Nothing was too much trouble and Elnouby truly is a credit…"

Our room was stylishly furnished, and with plenty of space for a family of four - two adults and two children. In particular we liked that the sofa bed for the kids had two separate mattresses/single beds contained within, which maximised their sleep and minimised any arguing. While only a short stay on this occasion we could also see how the kitchen facilities would prove very useful for essential self-catering. The Paddington hotel is just a short walk from Edgware Road underground station - convenient for the Bakerloo, Circle, and District lines; and quick to get access to other parts of the city. There's a pleasant regenerated canal area in the immediate vicinity…"

Jing Giahhis was our waiter and was professional yet very friendly. We started our experience in the Gong bar on the 53rd floor with 2 martini cocktails, then down to the 34th to Ting restaurant. We were expecting the evening to be very expensive, but worth it, 2 martini cocktails costing £75! But this was a very special occasion. Decor and views are amazing, all expected but still surprising. Even the loos were a surprise, heated seats and front and back nether regions washed and dried while seated, just by pressing buttons. Well worth every penny."

However, we were very surprised on check out that there was a 5% service charge on room rate per day .. breakfast was included but we were charged £7.50 per day service charge. 15% charge was added to the price of a cocktail and service charge added to mini bar costs. All of this we were not made aware of beforehand. We booked a deluxe city view room with floor to ceiling windows but this was obscured by a unit with a wide screen television on it. It’s been 10 days since our stay and we are still awaiting a credit of £240.88 which was overcharged to our bank after we had checked out. We were aware that there were a couple of items to be added to our bill but these were exceeded. It took a substantial amount of emails to clear this…"

The building is very clean and the service was very professional. Our server, Dave, knew the menu inside out and took great care of us. He was so considerate and we appreciate him offering to take our photos after the dry ice effect. The cocktails were so tasty and the staff even offered me a beautiful GF tray due to my intolerance so I didn’t feel like I was missing out. I 10/10, highly recommend this place if you ever visit The Shard."

1733,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Room was excellent, view world class, service and food exceptional and location was amazing. Initially we were concerned it was too far from the major tourist attractions but it is 100 ft to both a train and tube station and equal distance to the best food market we have ever been to.

We did not have our evening meal hear sadly as I wish we had, however the breakfast was lovely, everything you could think of was displayed on the buffet. Yes it is pricey but this was a special occasion and we have made some Iconic memories here, so thank you Shangri la. Hopefully we shall be back again.

Excellent food and wine. Great ambience, and exceptionally well looked after by Syed. Thank you for making a special night so anjoyable!"
1741,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Can’t beat the view - 35 floors up. Food was amazing, needless to say. Syed at the Tings was very helpful, he knew the menu very well and his recommendations cannot be faulted. Sour sop ice cream was incredible! We had a lovely evening and a great way to spend our 31st wedding anniversary."
1742,"Shangri-La The Shard, London",Amazing view and service We have the signature noodles and it was delicious and very tasty Don’t worry about the prices they are reasonable and in line with the view (Syed is the best!) Thank you
1743,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","The gong is a very fancy place and they let you know it through the attitude of the people there and the prices, the most expensive I ever saw for cocktails. But that's was still an amazing experience, thanks to the view and the 2 wonderful bartenders, Dani and Davide. They have been lovely with us all night long, and very attentive and managed everything so we can have nice pictures to remember this nice moment. A big thank to them!"
1744,"Shangri-La The Shard, London",The 3 course meal was bought for me by my wife as a 70th birthday present and we both thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The food was excellent and could not be faulted. The staff were very efficient and pleasant. It was wonderful to have such an amazing view along the River Thames from our table. Overall a very nice evening.
1745,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Ok so please don’t leave London without coming to eat here. It was amazing. I had the 5 course meal and it got better and better each time. Emilio was my server and he was amazing. Emilio was polite, very professional, friendly, knowledgeable of the dishes. I am so glad he was my server. Also Zoran was so nice and polite. They made my dining experience amazing. I felt very comfortable to eat solo. They were very welcoming. The chef Marcin needs a race (smile) because he cooks like a God. I am not exaggerating it was so good. I really recommend you eat here. Thank you all for a delicious dinner and a wonderful experience."
1746,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Lovely time at the ting restaurant. Syed Emil served us throughout the meal, he was a lovely lad with always a smile on his face. Food was great with amazing views. They even gave a birthday chocolate with the dessert which was so special."
1747,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Doran, Sved, Emil, and Euicio made our experience here great! The afternoon tea was superb, and there was plenty of options to choose from. The views were excellent as well; I would recommend coming here instead of riding the London Eye."
1748,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Service was perfection, food was divine and attention to detail was second to none. Helga was an amazing host. Great accommodations for food allergies. View was amazing. The drinks were lovely. Welcome tea was very nice, great selection of beverages. Generous portion size for afternoon tea."
1749,"Shangri-La The Shard, London","Arun, is the most professional receptionist I have ever encountered. His humility is second to none and his ability to accommodate my sensitive needs without making me feel like I was hiving him more work really left a positive imprint on me. To that extent I will now be exclusively staying at the Shangri-la when in London."
1750,The Imperial Hotel,"On arriving the greeting and service was very good. The room was excellent looking out over the river. The fine dining in the evening was good comprehensive menu and wine list, over all excellent would have no problems going back."
1751,The Imperial Hotel,"Lovely staff, excellent food well kept and clean. Needed an overnight stop and found the Imperial after a brief internet search. Very glad I did, will use again the next time i need to stop in north Devon."
1752,The Imperial Hotel,"Stayed for one night at this old style hotel and could not fault it. Warm and professional welcome from every member of staff I encountered. The room was spotless, beautifully decorated, warm and comfortable with everything I needed. It was quiet at night. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice and again a warm welcome from staff."
1753,The Imperial Hotel,"Very nice hotel. Service excellent, very clean, staff are amazing. They actually know how to run a hotel properly. In this day of unpersonal big chain hotels, it is nice to arrive somewhere where they offer a very friendly and warm welcome, and where there is plenty of staff around to greet you and offer you excellent service. I have stayed at many high-end hotels, at higher price points, and none had as good service as The Imperial. It was a real treat to stay there."
1754,The Imperial Hotel,"Friendly, helpful staff throughout the hotel. Recently refurbished bathroom with excellent power shower. Room cleaned to high standard each day. Room at rear on the second floor which was cosy but very peaceful. Breakfasts and evening meals of very high standard. Menu for evening was varied. Good seating downstairs and good bar room. Sufficient free parking on site. Has the benefit of being in centre of town with bus station within easy walking distance. Will be returning! Lynton and Lynmouth well worth a visit. Also drive to the car park at Saunton Sands with walk on massive beach that stretches for miles and climb up to the sister hotel Saunton Sands Hotel and have afternoon tea."
1755,The Imperial Hotel,"Recently stayed at the Imperial Hotel. Had a lovely few days visiting Arlington House and surrounding areas. Having recently had a dreadful experience at a 5* hotel in Derbyshire, I cannot praise the Imperial Hotel enough for dealing with my garlic Intolerance. No fuss was made, food was delicious and beautifully presented. A huge thank you to the whole team for this care and understanding. Back to the hotel in general. The bedroom 209 was well positioned with a large comfy bed. Complementary chocolates, fruit and drink were at hand."
1756,The Imperial Hotel,"An excellent family owned hotel in a superb position overlooking the river, near the town centre and transport facilities with well equipped and attractive bedrooms and comfortable lounges with a varied menu of excellent food which cannot be bettered"
1757,The Imperial Hotel,This hotel is most comfortable. The staff are a delight and made us feel at home. The food is great and presented in a beautiful manner. Can’t wait for our next stay. We were there in a bridge group booking and it couldn’t have gone any better. Already booked for next year.
1758,The Imperial Hotel,"All of the staff were always smiling, extremely friendly, polite and helpful, nothing was too much for them. The rooms and hotel itself was lovely and clean with comfortable furniture and nicely decorated. The food of course was amazing! We brought my Nan as my Grandparents had been visiting a few times a year for around 20 years. My Grandad recently passed away but coming to the Imperial for the first time and hearing all of the staff speak so highly of him and their memories with my Grandad really meant a lot to me and my family and I’m sure it would have meant a lot to my Grandad as well. The Imperial was his favourite place, he always told me about his stays at the hotel and how lovely all of the staff were and I’m glad I finally got to experience it for myself, I can’t…"
1759,The Imperial Hotel,"I'm in my 60s and I loved the grandeur and opulence of the reception and dining room. Our room was great and we had a small balcony and a river view, just a shame the weather was overcast but we still managed to sit outside. The bathroom is very luxurious and the shower was brilliant. Breakfast was overwhelming with numerous fresh fruit, juices and cereals from the buffet. Piping hot tea or coffee at your table and from the kitchen the choice was fantastic. I absolutely loved it and hopefully we will return again soon."
1760,The Imperial Hotel,"A really pleasant relaxed atmosphere, with very friendly staff who always do their best to be as helpful as possible. It is very nice to see members of staff whom we have met on previous visits. My only criticism would.be , that bar prices are a bit high, although I am aware that wine prices (like everything else have increased). Very few South African wines, although those you have are ‘top drawer’, perhaps a more modest one or two could be included?"
1761,The Imperial Hotel,"Adore this hotel, it was my late aunt's favourite and no trip to Devon was complete without a visit. Came again recently, happy to see the same high standards; they don't make them like this anymore. A real Devon institution."
1762,The Imperial Hotel,"Another very satisfactory stay at the Imperial. Excellent value for money ; delicious evening dinners & breakfasts to suit all tastes. The weather was cool but our room was warm and very comfortable. The staff,as usual, were efficient and friendly. The location of the hotel allows easy access to all that Barnstaple has to offer."
1763,The Imperial Hotel,"Excellent, traditional, good quality holiday hotel. Friendly, charming and helpful staff. Everything worked well. Close to centre of town. With parking. Ideal for our purposes of being well looked after whilst on a golf trip to Saunton."
1764,The Imperial Hotel,"We recently stayed at the Imperial Hotel in Barnstaple. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. There was a warm welcome on arrival from a very efficient reception team and although check in time to rooms is at 3pm we arrived just after 10am and began to enjoy our stay. Our luggage was stored by reception and taken to our room at 3pm. We were able to leave our car in the hotel car park. The coffee served to us in the light and airy (but cosy)Terrace Lounge was excellent as was the friendly and efficient service. The words welcoming, friendly, efficient, excellent and perfect passed through my mind so often throughout our stay at the Imperial. During our stay we were attending a celebration lunch hosted at the Imperial by friends. A separate lounge was set aside for…"
1765,The Imperial Hotel,"The imperial Hotel is the perfect location for a stay in North Devon, we couldn't fault anything other than the weather ! Our room was very comfortable and the service provided was second to none , we would definitely use again if we were in the area"
1766,The Imperial Hotel,"This hotel is difficult to fault. Excellent in every respect, in particular all the professional and friendly staff. Eg: my mother who has dementia had a fall and grazed herself. When we got back to the hotel, one of the managers (Jamie Gunn) did some excellent first aid in the most professional and affable manner. Would not hesitate to recommend wholeheartedly. Thank you"
1767,The Imperial Hotel,"Outstanding restaurant, quality and selection. Very well staffed, friendly. Old building but the room was done to a high standard, clean and well presented. Plenty of car parking. Located on the river with easy access to the town."
1768,The Imperial Hotel,"A very good stay in all respects. Excellent service, very good food . The hotel is extremely comfortable and the rooms very appointed. I was only slightly disappointed by the single bedrooms, they were very small especially in respect of the bed space. The bathrooms had recently been refurbished and they were very good with excellent water pressure and temperature."
1769,The Imperial Hotel,"From the time we arrived to when we left the Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. The room was excellent, the staff service impeccable and the food delicious. The location close in the Town centre was perfect but the hotel was not at all affected by traffic noise."
1770,The Imperial Hotel,"We had a couple of nights as a special birthdy gifts and absolutely loved the hotel. The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, the food was great and the location on the sea front was idyllic, despite dismal weather"
1771,The Imperial Hotel,We had a fantastic stay in this hotel. The food was outstanding and fabulous. Will be returning when we can. Room was lovely. The staff were excellent and couldn’t do enough for you. Would highly recommend.
1772,The Imperial Hotel,"Excellent 5 days at this wonderful hotel. Can only reiterate what others have said! What a find. Great food, pleasant and helpful staff. Cleanliness is a must for me and this place is spotless. I’ll be back!"
1773,The Imperial Hotel,"My stay at The Imperial was truly amazing, the Hotel itself is so clean, great atmosphere also.The Staff were so pleasant and helpful, the food was some of the best i have ever had with some great choices, the staff serving the food was absolutely brilliant catering for all your needs, i loved staying here and will certainly be going back to stay again"
1774,The Imperial Hotel,"Faded glory but it hasn’t faded a single bit! Still delivering the menu, service and quality that good hotels aspired to when I was a kid. Wonderful to be greeted for dinner by a person in a suit and tie. Staff are super present, zip in, know what they are saying and then zap off to make food happen. And the food turns up under a domed cover (forgotten the correct word) like something from an Agatha Christie movie. Menu and food itself (steak tournedos jeez my favourite thing in the world and you hardly ever see it anywhere) we’re great. Basically think murder on the orient express but it’s Barnstaple and doesn’t move. Menu great Service great (everyone is smartly dressed and super on point) Food really great Ambience and decor - you just can’t get this stuff from a modern…"
1775,The Imperial Hotel,"We loved staying at this delightful hotel. It is beautifully furnished, very clean and fresh flower arrangements give a charming atmosphere. It has very comfortable rooms and an excellent breakfast is provided. The four course dinner in the evenings is delicious. We stayed three nights and the menu was different every time. The staff are all kind and thoughtful and make you feel very welcome from the moment you step through the door. There is ample free parking and the hotel is in the centre of town but situated overlooking a beautiful garden and the river, giving a peaceful feel."
1776,The Imperial Hotel,"We stayed at the Imperial on a quick trip to visit my uncle in Devon. This lovely hotel is stately, yet kept up immaculately with beautiful furnishings, fresh flowers and top notch meals. Great experience, highly recommend."
1777,The Imperial Hotel,Just an absolute delightful luxurious weekend at The Imperial. A superb River view room with massive bed and top drawer bathroom.The staff were fantastic all round. Fine dining in the Restaurant was brilliant . Table D’hote changed daily catering for all tastes. We will be retuning.
1778,The Imperial Hotel,The location and ambiance of this graceful hotel allows perfect relaxation. The food was varied and of very good quality and the dining staff were most helpful. The room upgrade was most appreciated. Easy access to the shopping areas was just 5 minutes walk.
1779,The Imperial Hotel,"I have spent my working life in Hotels and am so glad to find that the Imperial places great emphasis on old fashioned values of service in a modern day hotel. The staff are what makes this a great place to stay, along with the food, ambiance, and comfortable rooms. In these modern times it is rare to find a Hotel that offers all this, and genuinely cares about their guests. Would certainly recommend!."
1780,The Imperial Hotel,A relaxing hotel for a short holiday .Food and restaurant was very good. The room had everything I needed .Location was very good and close to town centre . Good location for bus station for trips to local resorts .
1781,The Imperial Hotel,"We have visited the Imperial on many occasions over the past 20 years and our latest trip was as good as ever. Exemplary service provided by lovely staff, top quality food offerings and very well maintained accommodation at all price levels"
1782,The Imperial Hotel,Excellent central location Tastefull decor spacious comfortable bedrooms fine dining friendly helpful exceedingly well trained staff always on hand to help lounge areas beautifully appointed with comfortable chairs to relax read or take refreshment. Good parking A Real Hotel Thoroughly enjoyed our stay
1783,The Imperial Hotel,We stayed at the Imperial for two nights recently. We have now stayed here 4 times because it has a wonderful staff team who really know how to look after the guests. The place is clean and welcoming and the food is just exceptional. Thank you for a lovely stay and we will be back for certain.
1784,The Imperial Hotel,"Spent a valentine's night at Imperial.this is definitely a quality hotel met by concierge at door .this is grand inside like a country mansion.secure parking,beautiful room,large ensuite with shower over bath,spotlessly clean lovely bed quality sheets.we had breakfast which was excellent so much choice and staff are so attentive.5 mins walk from town great position next to river nice fo walks.would highly recommend.great value for money."
1785,The Imperial Hotel,"We received excellent care, service and food at a family Golden Wedding celebration in February 2023. The staff couldn’t have done enough for us and helped make the day really special. With 30 guests to cater for ranging from 18 months to over 90 years of age it was no mean feat in ensuring that everyone left happy and most importantly the Golden couple having had an excellent day."
1786,The Imperial Hotel,"We really enjoyed our three day Winter Warmer break. We thought the choice at breakfast was amazing and the table d’hote dinner provided a good choice. Our third floor bedroom was clean, quiet and a good size with a nice bathroom and super hot water which speedily fills the bath. The hotel has ample free car parking and is situated in a good and quiet location near the town centre. However the best part of the hotel is the staff who without exception were friendly and ultra efficient. The Winter Warmer break offers very good value. We will be back."
1787,The Imperial Hotel,"Having visited the hotel 6 or 7 times a year for 18 years, think there is nothing else to say.👍👍👍 Christmas especially wonderful, along with Valentine’s & Easter. Every other stay has been great. Management & staff cannot do enough for you."
1788,The Imperial Hotel,"The service and friendliness in this hotel is exceptional. We have returned many times, and the welcome is always the same, staff cannot do enough to ensure we enjoy our stay. Public areas are warm and comfortable and furnished to a very high standard. The restaurant is outstanding, both the furnishings and the food which is beautifully presented by staff who are always pleasant and professional. Over the years we have stayed in a number of different bedrooms, and have never found one to be anything but beautifully furnished, comfortable and warm (our last stay was in February), with en-suite bathrooms that have been refurbished to include modern showers and some with baths. Plenty of car parking spaces, even if the front car park is full, there are spaces behind the hotel…"
1789,The Imperial Hotel,"Returned to the imperial after 3 years, and it’s still the same, superb ! Deluxe room had fresh fruit waiting for us, staff were very attentive, a special mention to the restaurant staff who work so hard. All in all fantastic break and we will be back soon."
1790,The Imperial Hotel,"This is an excellent hotel perfectly located in Barnstaple, close to river walks and the town. As you enter the hotel it looks very clean and welcoming with extremely pleasant staff who were very smartly dressed. The room (211) was lovely with a recently refurbished bathroom. Just found the bed a bit small! The food in the Arlington restaurant was delicious, couldn’t fault it. Plenty of staff working so service was very prompt and attentive. All in all a very nice stay celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, wouldn’t hesitate to return."
1791,The Imperial Hotel,As we have been coming to the Imperial for many years we are pleased to see the warm welcome and excellent service remains the same as always. We look forward to our next visit which I am sure will not be too long in coming.
1792,The Imperial Hotel,"The Imperial is a particularly lovely traditional hotel in North Devon. We have stayed there several times and like all the Brend Hotels you can always be assured of friendly and helpful staff, lovely clean and comfortable rooms and excellent food. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
1793,The Imperial Hotel,"Comfy stay at this hotel. Friendly staff, clean facilities and ample parking. Unfortunately cant comment on bars/breakfast or dinner. Rooms quiet, warm and comfy enough - will re-stay when the opportunity comes."
1794,The Imperial Hotel,"Brilliant staff and food, building dated. The food was excellent and the staff we can't compliment enough. The building was clean but dated and the condensation on the windows in our room was unacceptable. Didn't want to complain as the staff were wonderful."
1795,The Imperial Hotel,"An excellent hotel, close to the town centre. There was free car parking on site, so we had no worries about parking. We had wonderful service from all the staff and excellent food in the restaurant. Will definitely go again."
1796,The Imperial Hotel,"Having stayed at the Imperial Hotel in Barnstaple, on previous occasions and remembering it's quaint old world charm, we chose to take a short break there again to both celebrate my birthday and kickstart 2023. As expected the time at the hotel was brilliant, the staff attentive but not intrusive, the rooms comfortable if not lavish, and the attention to minutiae exemplary. Then of course there was the food, superb lunches and amazing and imaginative dinners, not too forget wonderful breakfasts. Not overpriced, simply value for money. If stylish hotels with a penchant for old fashioned customer appreciation, and quality dining, are your thing ? The Imperial Hotel in Barnstaple is a must try experience."
1797,The Imperial Hotel,"We were dropping-off some furniture in North Devon in a hired van and needed a hotel to stay overnight. The Imperial Hotel in Barnstaple was an excellent choice. The Breakfast was excellent, cooked individually with old fashion table service. The hotel rooms are modern, clean and comfortable."
1798,The Imperial Hotel,"We went for a break after christmas and new year, and this hotel ticked all the boxes. Our 3rd visit in 18 months, we had a lovely room with everything you could need, water, excellent hot drinks tray with biscuits, lots of nice bathroom bits , big fluffy white towels on the hot towel rail, modern furnishings, great staff, the food was excellent. we had the evening meal deal inc in room rate, and it was 4 courses , all good quality and very enjoyable. see photos the hotel was on the last days of christmas decorations and was so pretty and comfortable. Room with lovely Views of the river worth having, a 3 min walk to town, and river walks are good too. Dont miss the free museum in the square a few minutes away, a good 2 to 3 hours is needed, great on a rainy day which we had.…"
1799,The Imperial Hotel,An excellent three nights at the hotel. The food is exceptional and all members of staff very friendly and helpful. This was our second visit at this time of year and hope to return for a third time in 2023.
1800,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,I was really impressed by the room design and just how spacious it was. Bed was very comfy and linens and pillows were great. The hotel itself was beautiful and smelled lovely from the moment you walked in. Would highly recommend.
1801,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Everything was fine. The hotel is very well located, in the heart of the city and everything is nearby. The quality of the room, the staff, the reception, the bar were at the top. Excellent value for money. In addition, it is very pleasant to have a hotel located in the center and very quiet."
1802,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"An amazing stay in an amazing city. The location couldn’t have been better, everything was right on the doorstep. This is my first time experiencing any of Virgins ventures and it left an impressive mark. From the quality of tissues to the extremely comfortable bed, you get what you pay for. I was tempted to ask for a bottle of lotion they provide in rooms so I can take it home with me, the whole hotel smelled amazing. I look forward to their hotel expansion in more cities, I will continue to choose them when available. If also only waited 2 minutes each time I asked them to call a taxi, it was perfect."
1803,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"This hotel was magnificent! We loved everything about it!! Wonderful staff, wonderful food , very clean and the location was beyond the best of all of old town edinburgh!! We truly would come back here again!!!!"
1804,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"We went there for cocktails and dinner after a whole day strolling in the city. It was a last minute choice and it did not disappoint! The staff was extremely friendly, the food was great and great quality/ price value. We absolutely loved it!"
1805,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Whoever conceived, designed and built this hotel is to be congratulated. It must have been a massive challenge in the historic and compact area that is Old Town Edinburgh. The hotel is in an excellent position. Very close to the castle and in walking distance of all of central Edinburgh, old and new. There is a nice roof terrace with a view of the castle and overlooking Greyfriars church and churchyard (don't miss the story of Greyfriars Bobby, the little dog who slept on his dead masters grave for years until he too died). The hotel main area decor is stylish and quirky and I loved it. My room was very modern and I liked the innovative use of space for the shower, toilet, wash basin and make up area (you could fit a family of four in the shower). Electrics in the room were very…"
1806,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Virgin Edinburgh is a gorgeous hotel with spacious rooms. It’s located super close to the Royal Mile, the castle, and lots of other in-city sights. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We highly recommend the hotel! The only issue we had was that there is no parking at the hotel and it is recommended to park 15 minutes away. I wish there was the option of valet parking for those of us unfamiliar with driving in the city."
1807,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Very much enjoyed our stay at this quirky but fun and charming hotel. The little red fridge was a really fun touch. The hotel was a bit confusing to negotiate but the staff was very helpful getting us to the right place. The location was great. We were able to walk to areas of interest.
1808,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Although in a 9th floor room overlooking the street, we were kept awake until past 3am by the noise of an outdoor nightclub next door, which (as we discovered) operates from 11pm to 3am. The hotel did their best to make amends, but admitted they have a noise problem, from both the club that kept us awake (called Bongo, to the side of the hotel) and another club at the back of the hotel. If you want a peaceful night's sleep, avoid this hotel. We were also made to wait a long time to check in due to shortages on the front desk (only one person on duty), we were given room keys that were filthy (covered in something sticky), there was a vacuum cleaner blocking the entrance to our room, and there was debris from the previous guests on the floor when we entered. The basin…"
1809,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Nice hotel, the size of the room was great and it was cleaned propertly. The food was fantastic at ""Eve"", I recommend the sharing plate IF you go there. Take a drink and go up to the rooftop, magnific view over the city!"
1810,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Really great hotel. I have always been interested in visiting a Virgin Hotel, after being a fan of the airline and cruise line. Felt like having a night in Edinburgh as an early birthday treat and the hotel did not disappoint. Edinburgh is a great city to visit as there is always much to see. I believe we got a complimentary upgrade to what must have been one of the most spacious rooms I have ever had in Europe. Clean, modern and love the bathroom design. Our room was just a wow room! My girlfriend is dairy free and we had most possibly the most ""normal"" (in a good way) cake we have ever tasted (made in house) . The Commons Club bar team also were also exceptional. Only one comment I would make is that for a hotel in the £350 + category I would have expected a Nespresso…"
1811,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"My husband & I both loved this hotel. The room was small but it was really cute and had everything you need. The hotel is very quirky with lots of little nooks to get lost in. We had read reviews that mentioned noise from the club, which we did hear one night but it wasn’t too bad. We didn’t eat in the hotel as there are plenty of places close by to choose from. We had some drinks in both the bars though, which both had a lovely atmosphere."
1812,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Virgin Hotels was amazing. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The room exceeded my expectations. The bar and restaurant were very convenient. I really enjoyed my staff here. It was in a great location and it was easy to get around Edinburgh.
1813,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"great room, needed front desk for check in/ check out nd to link his with two taxis we ordered, not only did none of them happen well but it did not seem to matter ... to us it did but very unresponsive in action and attitude."
1814,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"The location is awesome, hotel is nice but it is way overpriced for what it is. Front desk staff struggled, accommodations that were booked were not honored. We booked a family suite at $900 dollars a night to be told when we checked in that suite wasn't available so they rebooked us into two separate rooms. As a mom traveling in Europe with two female minors and being told we needed to split into two rooms was complete madness."
1815,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Oooof, Could have , should have, really tried. It is convenient, lovely design, beautiful room. Staff is sub par, would be a 5 if they didn't sick a valet who was busy doing family business on his mobile and an untrained receptionist. I can handle baggage with 2 kids and a car- the doorman was a rude speed bump. The receptionist stood mouth open asking a colleague what to do, not explaining our room wasn't ready, then someone came out and told me a cot was £100 not the £50 quoted. So not an hour after check in , she asked someone else what to do. I offered to leave our bags and go on a tour before the semi - vocal receptionist replied. Off we went praying our bags were in hand. We were informed that our room would be ready after 6, 3 hours after check in. We got…"
1816,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Just couple fault the hotel, checkin was seamless and attention to detail was perfect, fantastic in every way! Food at Eve was great, nice snack food before going out in the town. Really will be back for some more!"
1817,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Would not return, 50% price hike the day we checked in because of Bruce Springsteen concert .. Layout internally very confusing and rooms very basic, when our taxi to meet friends at restaurant did not appear, front of house staff very unhelpful .. food in restaurant and staff good, but again food very overpriced , will not be returning ."
1818,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Interior of property was top notch and ALL staff are amazing, helpful, kind, and, professional. Be VERY careful of room listing exterior shots as they can be quite different. Interior shots are spot on and rooms are very well laid out. Be sure you don’t get ones that are below ground (ie not much natural light) or overlooking the night club that goes until 3am. Earplugs didn’t help."
1819,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Reserve una habitación con terraza para tres dias pero el primero me dijeron que estaba ocupada y no sabian porque, asi que me dieron otra, al segundo dia la recupere pero cuando fui a pagar me cobraron los tres dias como si fuera la superior con terraza y lo peor es que no supieron darme una explicacion de porque habia pasado. Lo gestionaron muy mal."
1820,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"We loved this hotel. Great location, excellent staff and very comfortable rooms. We had our two whippets with us, who were made very welcome and allowed in the bars and one of the restaurants. Breakfast was a little chaotic but the service was fine once you were seated. Overall we loved it."
1821,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Great location, beautiful hotel with lovely friendly staff. The commons club has a really relaxed vibe to enjoy a couple of drinks. Brilliant breakfast the following morning in Eve with a fantastic selection to choose from."
1822,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"The surroundings are lovely but the hotel lacks substance. Service was generally poor. The breakfast is poor except the black pudding & slice sausage. The eggs where hard and I had to insisted they where cooked correctly on our second day.....just a poor breakfast for a said 5 star. On breakfast days the staff put us under a air condition unit and when asked to get it turn down this was a problem and could not do this and moved us, then one minute later they sat someone there and there food would get cold in no time. Moral of this to put someone in the same seat with a plant next to the seating moving around with the air-con vent is the last straw. We had to go looking for staff to serve us refreshment, we had 1 drink and went to another refreshment house. We where to eat in…"
1823,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Excellent stay with one exception "" the Spirit Hour "". Not fully explained that spirits were not included in the package. Staff helpful and polite. Our room was clean and well appointed. The hotel is situated near to the Scottish museum which is well worth a visit...escpecially if the weather is inclement."
1824,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Our first trip to this hotel in a great location in Edinburgh. Super friendly, great decor and lovely rooms with Castle View. All going great until 10.30pm when the extremely loud music from the adjoining Beer Garden struck up and remained horrendous until 3.00am when it shut. Happened both nights. The Hotel Manager dealt with the issue, after hearing our concerns, with a full refund of the three rooms for two nights. We couldn’t have asked for more. He , Pedro, was tremendous."
1825,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"This hotel is in a newly remodeled building and it is well done. My room was comfortable and included complimentary water, tea, and coffee. Snacks and drinks are extra. Decent fitness center and for walking, you are very close to the Royal Mile. Breakfast selections was a’ La carte and enjoyable. Enjoy"
1826,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"I wish I could rate this higher as I had high expectations for this hotel, however, most of our issues were due to human error and carelessness. The front desk is friendly, but rarely follow through with requests. We were moved from one room to another due to extremely loud parties in the terrace of the pub/restaurant next door. They left items in the room which housekeeping threw out, and the manager would not compensate us unless we produced a receipt. Sorry, but I don't travel with receipts for my toiletries--- unprofessional on his part. I requested a cab and had it reconfirmed--- when we went downstairs to catch our early cab to the airport, it hadn't been ordered. Our phone and thermostat were broken in the room we were moved to, and again, we reported it and came…"
1827,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,My fiancé and I came to Edinburgh to celebrate our engagement and felt so welcomed. The staff were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to help us set up some activities. The hotel room was unique and inviting. We were in the heart of Old Edinburgh and could walk to anything we wanted to see in the city. There was one night (Saturday) where noises from the street were pretty loud but that is something we expect may happen when staying in a city.
1828,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Une magnifique hôtel, dans une des plus belles rues de la ville. Une chambre spacieuse, et moderne. N’hésitez pas d’aller sur le Rooftop pour admirer la vue. Le petit déjeuner était vraiment excellent. Un personnel au petit soin, rien à redire."
1829,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Spent a few days at Virgin hotels during a portion of our honeymoon in Edinburgh. The hotel is uniquely designed and the rooms were comfortable and well equipped. The restaurant was great for both breakfast in the morning and evening drinks/dessert after dinner in the city. The staff was very friendly and accomodating.
1830,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,The hotel and staff are trained to the highest level. A beautifully decorated hotel ! Although Edinburgh has many fine restaurants please don't go past the Commons Club Restaurant ! Culinary Expertise... Excellent Breakfast menu at EVE to suit everyone - I dare anyone not to find something they like. Rooms are exceptional with hidden surprises ! Please don't hesitate to Experience this hotel.
1831,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Everything was just perfect. Welcoming friendly staff. Need some coffee? Sure, we‘ll bring to your room! Where can we eat some porridge at 1 p.m.? Let me ask our Eve restaurant, they do a great porridge! (Which was in deed great) The bed is amazing. We had a perfect sleep. The noise insulation towards the outside is great, as are the black-out shades. We love this hotel and will come back without hesitation."
1832,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Muy bien ubicado, moderno, y lo más reseñable es la amabilidad del personal, y su buena disposición. Sin nada de ruidos para el descanso y con un desayuno estupendo y muy bien atendido. La limpieza perfecta y las habitaciones muy bonitas"
1833,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Spotlessly clean hotel. Staff so well trained. They go out of their way to help you. Good place to get around to different attractions. Breakfast and dinner superb. Bar very nice. Reception Staff very knowledgeable.
1834,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Please kindly improve customer service at every level. The bed was not very comfortable and room was facing some renovations which did not make it very attractive and also was noisy at times. Decor is spectacular but does not match the service.
1835,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Fantastic room, great bath and amenities. We had a balcony room which was extra nice. Tech based services (e.g., TV room service ordering, one-touch phone services) was lousy. Trips to the front desk to request ice bucket refills and multiple phone calls to get fresh linens marred an otherwise good experience. Eve Restaurant food was superb!"
1836,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"What a lovely experience! The service was impeccable, the accommodations so fun, with a little cheekiness while being high quality. Thank you so much for a stay we will remember. We will be back! Highly recommended"
1837,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"The Virgin Hotel was perfectly located, close to everything without being disruptive. Staff was great and the room was pristine, well kept. Really enjoyed the convenience of the digital lighting and the minibar variety."
1838,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Great location surrounded by everything you could want on a visit to Edinburgh. Incredibly friendly staff that are kind and helpful. Just steps away from the Royal Mile and Victoria Street, with great options for dining and sightseeing."
1839,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"We enjoyed our stay at the Edinburgh Virgin Hotel. Our room looked out over the castle and the rooftop deck had great views. In spite of the age of the hotel, the renovated rooms are modern and very comfortable. Kudos to the friendly and helpful staff."
1840,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"We had a regular room at Virgin Hotel in Edinburgh. Reception was great! Explained everything about the hotel and attractions we could walk to from the hotel. The hotel has a modern feel, loud music playing all the time. The regular rooms are small - not a lot of extra space. We had a balcony and view of the street below. The bed was comfortable - not really soft but ok. The location is the best - walkable to everything. Even though it is an 'easy' walk from the tram from the airport, with luggage, it's not. There are some uphills that are not easy with luggage. We didn't have a car yet so can't tell about the parking situation. We added breakfast onto the bill. It was an extra $20 and worth it. Unless you have a better idea of where to eat - the offerings are good and…"
1841,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,This hotel is definitely 5 star quality ! As part of the business I was in I evaluated customer service and Virgin far exceeded my expectations. Ryan and Jannis served us Breakfest every morning and knew our names and preferences. Stephanie at the front desk was so cheerful and helpful. The bell staff ordered our taxis and didn’t want us to get cold so they had us sit in the warm library and came and got us when the taxi came. We had a junior suite that was so spacious and nice. Definitely the highest tech hotel we have ever stayed in. Took us awhile to figure it all out! The location is fantastic as well. Right next to the Royal mile but on a quieter street. Overall just a great experience and highly recommend to others considering a stay in Edinburg
1842,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,This is well and truly a 5 star experience right in the middle of Edinburgh just off the royal mile. Can’t fault anything other the the vibration from the adjacent nightclub which could be a real issue if you’re staying in the rooms near the back of the nightclub. Didn’t go as far as ruin our stay and the staff were ready to accommodate us should the issue have got any worse but be aware of this when booking especially on nights when the nightclub is open to 3am.
1843,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,We had such a great time at this hotel. The room was super comfortable and quiet. The staff were universally friendly and helpful. The location is great. Breakfast was great too. Highly recommended if you want a nice oasis in the bustle of the center of Edinburgh.
1844,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,The hotel was everything we expected and some more. Location was great and the staff was very friendly and ready to assist anytime. We would definitely recommend it to family and friends. I would go back anytime.
1845,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Very dog friendly. Went the extra mile and remembered our names etc. Rooms are very cool but also practical. Will def stay again and have already recommended to others. No parking available fyi but options within a short walk.
1846,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,Hotel located in the best place at Edinburgh (of course if you like city tours). The staff is very friendly and hospitality on the highest level. Rooms are presenting highest standard the same as food & beverage.
1847,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Lavish designer hotel in central Edinburgh that comes across as high-end without being overtly posh. I found my room perfectly clean, with one of the best-stocked minibars I've come across and excellent comfort - I can't remember a hotel where I've slept better. Despite facing a busy street my room was quiet at all hours. Would certainly consider staying here again next time I'm in Edinburgh. One word of warning: if you're coming from Princes Street or Waverley then it's a fairly steep climb up to the Royal Mile where the hotel is. Also, if you're a heavy room service user, know that they had a few hiccups during my stay, with orders delayed or not arriving. An unexpected blemish on an otherwise top-tier stay."
1848,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"The hotel is unique and beautiful. The bar has great drinks and the bar keeper understands mixology, well. Opt-in to have breakfast with your stay as the EVE restaurant on the first floor is beautiful and very boutique. Nice stay this time and everything was almost perfect."
1849,Virgin Hotels Edinburgh,"Wonderful location and the room. When I arrived the hotel, the room is opend recently, so the smell is not good. I asked for new one, finally I got #613 room, which is very nice and wonderful. Tha you for your kindness."
1850,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,Fantastic hotel with great facilities but severely let down by their converted twin rooms. These beds are highly uncomfortable as the mattress topper is insufficient to cover the join and makes for the most unpleasant experience. Having upgraded from a Club Double to an Executive Room this was even more disappointing. Please reduce the amount of twin rooms or find a better solution when joining the two twin beds together to make a double.
1851,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Fantastic hotel with amazingly friendly and professional staff from check in desk right through to the restaurant and bar. Have stayed in many hotels in Leicester over the years and by far this hotel is a little gem. Great rooms and the line. Is always spot on, I can’t fault it and highly recommend!"
1852,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"My husband and I check in to Hotel Brooklyn, Leicester and were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff members. Check in was easy and quick. The hotel itself was beautiful, modern, extremely clean, well appointed. Our room was spacious, with lovely amenities including coffee, biscuits, and books to read! We opted to include breakfast with our stay, which was excellent. We will absolutely stay there again when we return."
1853,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,One of the best hotels i have ever stayed in and will be booking it again for sure the rooms were great the whole place looks brand new easy to get to the main town and check in was easy i only wish that there was one near me
1854,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,We had a lovely meal and all the food was chosen by Oscar I was taking a family friend and his colleague who had just passed their first year medical exams. Thank you Oscar. You will do well! The atmosphere was nice and very relaxed and we will go again for a hospital or medical school celebratory drink and bite to eat.
1855,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"The hotel is lovely & decor amazing. Great location for De Montfort Hall & short walk into town.Only criticism was breakfast - short staffed & tables not cleared, buffet items not replaced & coffee machine not working - things gradually got worse over 3 days of stay. Staff were lovely especially Sylvia who kept smiling throughout but there just weren’t enough of them! Would definitely come back & hopefully staffing levels would be better"
1856,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,i Stayed at Brooklyn Leicester a day before my wedding . The room was very spacious and clean. The staff were friendly and useful. I would definitely recommend staying here. Breakfast was also great
1857,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Rude lady at the reception , always i waited mor then 5min to let me in into the parking lot , what i paid for 20£ /day . In general the hotel is very clean , they clean your room every day what means fresh towels , no minibar in the room . And they charge you 50£ sexurity deposit in advance"
1858,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"We had a pleasant stay in the hotel. Reception staff were so welcoming they had a big restaurant with a bar is fabulous. Room were big and clean, In short it was very well maintained property at nominal price. We had one of the best breakfast for that price, loads of option to choose and fresh food were available.All the staff were excellent. I want to take this opportunity and appreciate Ms.Sylvia for her kindness and helping us on the breakfast counter."
1859,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Booked the room with a hot tub for my partner’s birthday. Room was lovely and the bed was really comfortable. The food was major disappointment, the evening meal was well overpriced at £150 for 2! The steak was fatty and tasteless. Also I don’t think burgers should be on Al La Carte menu! The breakfast was self service which I don’t mind but the sausages, bacon, mushrooms were cold the black pudding look uncooked and was also cold. Using the kitchens pass was not keeping the food hot, you need proper hot plates or heat lights. The hash browns were the only thing hot. Would return for the room but would recommend to anyone to dine out for better food and reasonable prices."
1860,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Great staff: They were very friendly Very welcoming Great smiles Very helpful Like Samantha, and Sylvia Great rooms: They’ve got old New York style theme, The rooms are clean, tidy, has everything you need The lair is a great place to study, to relax also the food is delicious as well, even the drinks are amazing Good prices"
1861,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Fantastic modern hotel. Staff couldn’t be friendlier or accommodating. Great position and easy to navigate too. Stayed on the 2nd floor so expected some noise but was presently surprised how quiet it was. Quick parking although limited space and £20 per night but easy enough. Need to pre book. Ev charging available but didn’t use so can’t comment on charging rate. Breakfast, full English was the best I’ve had in any hotel. Ordered room service for evening meal. Pizza £14. Although really high quality food was disappointing to be informed collect from restaurant or pay £10 pound extra to get it delivered to room. Not exactly room service. Bit awkward standing in a lift with a tray full of pizza with 2 strangers breathing over your food. Rooms. Everything you want from a hotel.…"
1862,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Great hotel, nice decor, comfortable beds, good facilities, nice bar/restaurant area and pleasant and attentative staff. The rooms had every little detail taken care of. Definitely would stay again!!!"
1863,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,It's been an amazing stay with them. We had been there with our team and we were there for 8 days.. nice hotel with good facilities and location is very good. Their room and bathroom is equipped with all modern facilities.
1864,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Nice modern hotel with American themes. Very helpful and friendly staff. Liked the restaurant and bar, and the food was very good (fish and chips with a pint).. Stayed as I had an early hospital appointment over the road at LRI, the hotel gave me a good rate, thank you!"
1865,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"5/5 Superb contemporary hotel, comfy beds, fluffy quilts, rainfall shower. No traffic noise despite proximity to main road (which is why we chose it as it was in our route) Very friendly. Small car park £20 per night. Buffet breakfast was amazing!"
1866,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Nice modern hotel. Rooms are a good size and have safes and fridges, although no real milk in the fridge, just that UHT stuff. Good wi-fi and our room had a nice view of the Tigers Stadium frontage and the playing field opposite. If you are on the other side of the building you get a great view of Leicester Royal Infirmary! Watch out for: parking. Hotel only has a handful of spaces so we parked in the Tigers Crumbie car park as advised. On entering the car park we were advised we could only park there for one night (we had a 2 night stay) because they were overflow parking for the football the following day. Fortunately we managed to go back and chat to someone different in the car park hut the following morning and got another night's stay sorted, but the price was £2.50 more…"
1867,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"First time at this newer hotel, convenient to Leicester Tigers and King Power Stadium. Nice decorated hotel, rooms were a god size and the price was on point. Staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Had a nice lunch with family, in the Lair. Special thanks to Gabriel and Sylvia who were very attentive and took great care of us."
1868,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"The locationwas unbelievable.. a stone throwawayfrommy point of interest. The hotel's design and decor were superb. The staff friendly, service meticulous. I enjoyed breakfast options. I'll definitely visit again."
1869,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Stopped overnight in the hotel.Lovely place to stay, relaxing, the food was really nice, beds really comfy the room was quiet the staff were really nice especially Silvia at breakfast. Would definitely stay again."
1870,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Not like a 4 stars hotel, if you tell me that a motel I would defintely agree with it. Staffs are not happy with their jobs, absolulately non-welcoming. No toothbrust, toothpaste and slippers are provided."
1871,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Stayed in the terrace hot tub suite , room 532 Service levels were amazing , room was above and beyond expectations, levels of customer service were up there with the best hotels we have stayed in , hotel is a very aesthetically pleasing The only down side was the terrace suite we was in was not private enough, your are looked over by other rooms and people can actually see through the glass , the hotel had made an effort to put some greenery up to make the terrace more private, personally we didn’t feel it sufficient, apart from this I can not fault the whole experience Will 💯 be coming back and for longer , 1 night is not enough Great location Wonderful staff Value for money ? ABSOLUTELY"
1872,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Please check the website CAREFULLY for the parking information. Its not readily obvious from the website. My husband booked this hotel for a business trip and is regretting it! After driving 5 hours he arrived at the hotel and buzzed to get into the car park only to be told you have to book a parking space. No problem, he asked where he could park seeing as he didn't have a parking reservation and was told that was 'not my problem' by the person on the other end. He drove round for a while and managed to park briefly to at least get checked in. At reception he was asked if he had tried the tigers carpark as if he should have known about it already, we live in Glasgow and he is there for 2 days and this was booked last minute when his other hotel fell through, how could he…"
1873,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Surprised my boyfriend with a two night stay for his birthday and its our new favourite hotel! Beautiful decor, spacious rooms and lovely breakfast. I don't tend to write reviews, but on our second day we returned to the room to find a birthday plate with a mini chocolate cake and chocolate covered strawberry - really unexpected and a lovely, thoughtful touch. The staff went above and beyond and we will certainly be coming back!"
1874,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Stayed for a night midweek whilst on business in the area. It’s a super, modern hotel that is amazing value for money. Likes: easy to find, lovely rooms with large comfortable bed, nice bar with good beer choice, decent restaurant, very friendly and efficient staff. Dislikes: the recommended car park at Leicester Tigers was closed, the second recommended car park at Welford Road is awful. £25 overnight for a genuinely scary experience trying to navigate my car around probably the tightest spaces and ramps I’ve ever encountered, if you are driving anything bigger than a city car give it a miss. Overall, a lovely hotel and will definitely use again. I may be tempted to take the train next time, however."
1875,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"It was heading for a 9.5 until the hot tub issue and the below average breakfast the main bit my wife was looking forward towith it being her birthday treat.We informed reception to hear "" sorry to hear that"" having parted with £300+ being spent with your business for 1 night find it poor customer service also."
1876,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"We stayed at this fabulous hotel for two nights. All the staff are polite and extremely helpful including the Operations Manager who is always on hand. On our second morning breakfast was very busy, but the staff including the General Manger were on top of things and kept things moving along. I like how the tables are spaced out so you don't feel like you are sitting on top of each other. Also great choice at Breakfast time inclduing the waffle maker. Only negative was they ran out of Guiness after the match We will definitely stay at the Hotel Brooklyn again."
1877,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Our second stay at this hotel - our party was 7 people. Rooms are very well equipped and well furnished, breakfasts very good, except the choice of bread is poor (how about some sourdough?) - and it even ran out totally on our second morning - bad management! But overall, a great place to stay - staff on reception could not be nicer, and I would like to mention one of the managers - Sylvia - who was so pleasant and took time to chat to us, even on the busy rugby match day. We will always stay here when coming to the city."
1878,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,Stayed at the Brooklyn when husband was in icu at the royal . Staff were so kind to me and my stay was as good as it could be would recommend the Brooklyn to anyone hope to return with husband when he has recovered xx
1879,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Everything about the hotel itself was fantastic, the room was clean and very spacious, comfy bed, lovely large powerful shower. The bar area was very modern and drinks were reasonably priced and the staff very friendly. Unfortunately the breakfast let it down. For a hotel of its class, the breakfast was awful. The food itself was very cheaply sourced, and undercooked. This may have been due to the fact it was very busy with only two chefs cooking. It was also very disorganised when the staff were trying to seat everyone. Fortunately we paid a discounted price for the breakfast buffet of £10 instead of £17, but even then this was over priced and could have found better value and tastier food in a Wetherspoons pub."
1880,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,I had a great time!! All the staff were just lovely!! Thank you. Watched the Coronation on the big screen in the Lair - great occasion. Then I attended the Tigers match at 4 o'clock; great atmosphere with a packed Welford Road Stadium!!
1881,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,great contemporary hotel on outskirts of leicester. next to leicester Tigers stadium this American inspired hotel is great. Modern and spacious with excellent bar/restaurant areas. parking is the only bug bear with very limited at hotel and not much around that i would leave my car at.
1882,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"We stayed for 1 night, to watch the rugby and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were comfortable, the staff were all lovely and we will definitely stay again. The only negative part of our stay was the food. The sausages and bacon we had with our full english breakfast were of such poor quality, we couldn't eat it. Its a real shame and the reason for not giving 5 stars."
1883,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Very good decoration, staff was very kind. Room and Hall very quiet. Breakfast was very complete Location is good Quite close to the train station Close to a green park, the king power stadium Very good value for money"
1884,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"New; fresh; convenient. What a treat after super-expensive London. Room was large; bathroom was large. Everything worked, including the AC Nice British breakfast buffet. Nice staff at the bar. Connected to the rugby stadium and an easy walk to the King Power."
1885,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Our first visit, after wanting to stay for a while. Hotel staff that we met were friendly and helpful. Hotel itself, whilst still very new, doesn’t look like it’s being that well maintained - every room door we saw looked like it needed repainting, and the stuffs and dings aren’t being kept on top of. No parking available, despite trying to reserve a space weeks - maybe months - before our visit; that’s a bit unusual for what is an out-of-town hotel. Bed was a bit small - most places tend to offer a king size as standard these days. Biggest problem we had - that adversely impacted the quality of the sleep - was the pillows. Only two on the bed, and no others left in the room; they were very thin, and very narrow. It’s about a 20 minute walk into the city centre, but good…"
1886,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Lovely friendly face greeted us! Sylvia is amazing and nothing is too much for her to sort for us xx beautiful surroundings and lovely atmosphere 🥰, been before and will come here again, thank you for fab experience 💖let's get everyone to comment at this beautiful American like style themed hotel, we loved it!!!!"
1887,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Second time staying here and once again delighted with our experience. We enjoyed our Korean/Japanese tapas last night. The squid, in my opinion a difficult thing to cook well, was done to perfection. This morning we enjoyed the full English plus waffles. Most hotel buffet breakfasts are poor with food drying out under the heat lamps but this again was great. It could have been cooked a la carte as the yolks on the eggs were still runny. Special praise to Aboella H as not only does he cook very well but he is also very friendly and approachable."
1888,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Have to say, this is my go-to hotel in Leicester. I stay in many, many hotels, and this one is special. It has a lighthearted, funky American theme, but it takes the basics seriously - the cleanliness, the customer service, the commitment to hospitality. Every room I've stayed in has been great - effective air conditioning, coffee machine, utter cleanliness. And that staff in the bar and restaurant are consistently welcoming, informal, keen to please, and entertaining. It's great to be in a modern, stylish hotel so close to the city centre. It's great to stay in a hotel that is so consistently good. To all the Brooklyn team - thank you."
1889,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Wonderful Hotel very nicely done. Rooms are very specifically designed by New York style, modern and clean. Restaurant food was very good to. We went to a Leicester City game coming from California. Highly recommend!"
1890,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Fantastic hotel, friendly staff, great rooms, super clean and really good bar/ restaurant. Can't recommend this hotel enough. One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. Will definitely be back in the future !"
1891,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"From the friendly lady at reception, to the spacious and modern layout of the bar area to our evening business do to our breakfast it was a very clean, modern, spacious stay, all with helpful and friendly staff (crew). We will certainly be coming again. Many thanks to all."
1892,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"A really superb hotel with a great vibe! Super- stylish with tasteful, witty flourishes; like the selection of novels and short stories by 20th Century American novelists at the bedside and some decent grub. Better than San Quentin anyday! Made me feel like I was in not stuck like some schmuck in the bores-me-to-death Bronx and L.A. of my childhood before I was.. went away, back in The Fifties, but Stateside...yeah!...that's it! ....Chicago...South of the River Ganges maybe...yeah!...that's it!...Ma would like that! ...In other words, a great place to escape from reality-whatever the ....that is!"
1893,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"We had the best stay. A wonderful, modern and very clean room (and hotel). The evening meal in the Lair was excellent, top marks to the chef, and also the service from the staff there was great, very friendly. Breakfast also was faultless, high quality food served hot, not warm as is often the case with buffets, and the choice of other breakfast items was fab. Decent coffee too! We had no objections to paying the parking charge, if you don't want to pay then park somewhere else, simple. All in all, perfect. Thanks to all the staff, and the manager for a well run ship"
1894,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Not happy with the service at all, reception never answer the phone. However we had a phone call at 12:30 am which was really loud and disturbed our sleep it was the receptionist asking us if we had parked the car in front of the reception which we didn’t and she didn’t even apologise for calling the room at midnight and was laughing and giggling !! Also when we arrived at the hotel we were told that car park is full and we were asked to take the car and park it elsewhere which was an extra £15 to pay. We would never go back again Really unprofessional"
1895,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"We didn’t stay at the hotel but did eat at “The Liar” and the food was great! The manager Sylvia was extremely helpful, friendly and very professional. We will be returning next time to experience the rooms and hospitality as this visit has been great."
1896,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"The hotel was clean and the room was lovely, however, we were on the second floor above the function room, when we went to bed the noise was dreadful. There really should be some warning that guests on lower floors may experience some noise, if we had known we would have asked for a higher floor. Drinks in the bar varied from £15 to £10 for the same 2 drinks. When we asked we were advised that a discretionary service charge was added to the drinks! Discretionary is up to the customer, not hotel staff. The same thing happened at dinner. They did stop doing it once we challenged the pricing but it soured the trip, and for that reason we would not return. That and the extortionate parking charges. No one likes being ripped off."
1897,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Loved the contemporary but classic feel, design and decor of the hotel. Rooms continue the theme, are spacious with great showers and good tea/coffee making facilities including coffee machine. the bar area was great too - good vibe over looking the Leicester tigers. Breakfast was lovely. The stay was fantastic value too."
1898,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,"Very good hotel. Excellent value, nice well equipped rooms, and good food. Easy check in process. Parking available on site and in good location for city centre. Modern, clean and good layout. Would recommend it to anyone visiting Leicester"
1899,Hotel Brooklyn Leicester,Gorgeous hotel and they think of everything! Systems were down but staff were helpful getting me checked in at self check in which was easy to use. The room was amazing with everything you’d need. Didn’t have time for breakfast but looked lovely. Will definitely stay again!!
1900,Novotel London Blackfriars,The bar was so welcoming. They offered us nuts! Ankit was the reasons we stayed for a third drink. Thank you!! We had a wonderful time. You made us laugh. You deserve a raise! We’ll be back! Hopefully!
1901,Novotel London Blackfriars,"The matrimonial bed doesn’t have a small side cabinet for mobile. I need to put on the floor, very uncomfortable. The pool and sauna are very good with good infrastructure. You need to schedule before use and they give you an Electronic key for pool and sauna. The family room I found too small and the shower is not appropriate for family and kids. Because are more designed for couples in honeymoon as they have an electronic glass who goes black and transparent showing the person on the shower. I found inappropriate for a family room as my kid start to play with buttons on the showers. We pay an average of £800 for 2 adults and 2 kids (4 and 14 y) For 3 days"
1902,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Victor and Matthew in the restaurant were amazing, remembered our drinks, food preferences and just were the most amazing team, we have stayed here a number of times and the team show a respect. From Katie on check in to victor and Matthew, we love this hotel they always remember us and are just polite and helpful"
1903,Novotel London Blackfriars,"A quality Service always needs to be recognised, and in the many years I have travelled and the various hotels around the world ~I have stayed, few meet the levels of Service provided at the Novotel. The staff are friendly, engaging and whatever the ask, it was never any trouble. The highlight for me though was Katie, who from the minute I arrived made me feel welcome and even though this must have been the one hundredth time today that she had explained the times for breakfast, the locations of the amenities, this direction to the lifts etc, it was delivered with all the enthusiasm of her first. Being polite, courteous and making me feel special was effortless….Thank you!!! how to raise the bar in the customer experience, exceptional. Novotel, London Blackfriars….ant…"
1904,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Great hotel in an excellent location 2 minutes away from a tibe station and within walking distance of many of the famous london attractions. We were on the ninth floor and the views were amazing looking out onto the shard and the city. The room was clean, comfortable and well decorated and the glass bathroom wall which could be changed from transparent to opaque was a fun touch. Would love to stay again!"
1905,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Rooms were very good and bed was comfortable. Staff were helpful and friendly and the location for us was excellent as we were up for a rugby match at Twickenham and hotel is just a short walk from Waterloo. Additionally not far from London Bridge area which a vibrant area at night and Borough Market. The cooked buffet breakfast was good and the added bonus a gym, sauna and pool to help balance the calorie intake. Will definitely look to stay again."
1906,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Couldn’t fault anything about our stay, lovely service and so close to a tube station which was perfect! We will definitely be back. the swimming pool was an added bonus, and perfect to unwind in after a busy day around the city. Thankyou Novatel!"
1907,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Stayed in this hotel for a weekend. The hotel is nice and very clean. Our room was located on 8th floor which gave us a lovely view. Even though the hotel is near busy road and close to railways, the rooms were very quiet. Any question or request we had during our stay was never an issue to the reception staff, who were able to help us within minutes, and with a big smile on their faces! The staff were also amazing with our little girl, always found time to give her a high five or have a little conversation with her. We have used the pool facilities as well, which is lovely and clean. Food at the restaurant connected to the hotel was amazing, and their porn star martinis to die for! we would be back for sure if we are ever in London again."
1908,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Awesome service, room super clean and very comfy, will go again. Haven’t used the pool but pool seemed really nice, nice big walking shower with a controlled glass towards the room. Big screen, nice view (depending the floor), got a room on the 10th floor. Was a great experience. Thank you"
1909,Novotel London Blackfriars,We stayed at Novotel Blackfriars for 3 nights. The front desk was amazing and very helpful. We enjoyed the pool!! The room was comfortable and clean! We had brekfast and was very good. We will definitely come back next time.
1910,Novotel London Blackfriars,We stayed at Novotel Blackfriars for the second time and every time we loved it. The staff at front desk was very helpful and welcoming.Room was clean and comfortable.We liked breakfast and all the team at the restaurant .We will definitely come back for our next stay.

1912,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Stayed here as it's convenient for work, walking distance to train station, clean comfortable room, superb big TV, nice pool to relax after a stressful day, staff at the desk and breakfast helpful and friendly."
1913,Novotel London Blackfriars,"When we booked Novotel at booking.com, we checked if they have baggage storage and booking.com site indicated yes. This is important to us because when we go to London, we normally stay for 2 weeks. In between we will go to another destination. So when we checked-in, we specifically informed the front desk that we need to store our luggage for 3 days after we checked out in 3 days time but will be back to the hotel for another 8 nights. The front desk assured us yes they will store our luggage. To our horror when we checked out on the third day, getting ready to the train station to Paris, we will told they don’t have storage for luggage. Luckily our daughters stayed nearby and we quickly booked a taxi to send our 2 luggage there for 3 nights. Imagine if we don’t have a place to…"
1914,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Cannot fault our stay here over New Year. Had two rooms either side of corridor, and as it was at the end of the corridor the two rooms had an extra door in the hallway to make them private. This was perfect for the kids giving them their own space but still with the security of mum and dad across the hallway. Breakfast was great, never too busy, we could always book the pool more or less when we wanted. Room was fine and cleaned and stocked daily. Staff on front desk were always helpful and welcoming. I see some reviews and think they must be staying somewhere else to where we did."
1915,Novotel London Blackfriars,"We stayed here for four nights (4-8 Jan) and let me tell you, we will definitely come back again when we have the opportunity. The location is brilliant - near the Tower & Millennium Bridge, Tate Modern and National Theatre, and less than a minute walk to Southwark station, which will take you straight to the center of town. The room is up to standard - spacious, modern, comfortable, and, most of all, clean. You've got nothing to worry about in this department. Plus you get free WiFi, bottled water, & they'll also leave a few Walkers cookies out for you, which are oh-so yummy! The buffet breakfast is delicious - plenty of eggs, bacon, sausages, pastries, and coffee to go around. Sorted! Bar none the standout of our stay was the staff. Everyone was exceptionally welcoming and…"
1916,Novotel London Blackfriars,"We stayed here over Christmas, my brother who is on medication that has made him gain weight had his first time out the house in months but was fat shamed by staff, they were extremely hostile to him at breakfast the coffee machine and pancake machines were not ready and my brother politely asked them to turn it on and they were rude and blunt and we’re constantly huffing. My brother is very quiet and shy. They harassed my mother she gave the women her room number when entering the breakfast reception and when she sat down to eat other staff went up to her 3 times after asking her room number again. There was a total of 5/6 guests at the time and they only went up to her. room service took my swimsuit hanging up and mixed it with dirty laundry from the hotels other guests so I…"
1917,Novotel London Blackfriars,"18 hours flight with the family and we finally arrived at the hotel. Location is very good, very close to 2 train stations, Southwark and Blackfriars. So anyone travelling from Kings Cross Station or Paddington (and bring luggages), will find this hotel is a walking distance to Southwark station. I was welcomed and checked in by the guest service named Mr Alberto, who is then finally become my favourite manager. Not to exaggerate things, but the service he has given was trustworthy, quick, and simple. He has helped us a lot during our stay in Novotel. Thanks Alberto and also thanks to all housekeepers in Novotel Blackfriars. Ok, now the hotel review. Room is clean and bed is also comfortable, hot and cold water are reliable, and room is quiet so the sleeping is good. Pricing…"
1918,Novotel London Blackfriars,Within 10 mins walk from London Waterloo station. It was very convenient and you would access to many popular attractions. Staff were very friendly. Room was clean and good enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. Advance booking was recommended for the indoor swimming pool. Buffet breakfast was good though it was a bit busy. Will stay this hotel if we need a short break in London
1919,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Booked the hotel as we had theatre tickets, and it was reasonably, priced close to an underground station. Check in was easy, our room had a King size bed with a rollout bed for our Daughter. Our room was on the second floor and over looked the main road, and also a pub. I am a light sleeper so did struggle to sleep with the constant noise outside, if we were to stay again I'd request a higher floor or to be at the rear of the hotel. Room was large for London standards and was really well laid out with space-saving bathroom doors and the glass panel separating the bathroom from the bedroom meant it was a nice bright room, loved the way the glass turned from clear to privacy at the touch of a button. Room also had a safe and a fridge stocked with water, tea and coffee making…"
1920,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Good breakfast (plenty of choice) comfortable and clean room meant this was a nice hotel to stay at. Staff were friendly and helpful, and the swimming pool was great adding up to a great stay. The hotel is a short walk from Southwark and Waterloo stations putting it in a handy location for getting around London. Would definitely stay again."
1921,Novotel London Blackfriars,"I stayed multiple times at the hotel this year. Service was spot on. Clean rooms, good snacks and drinks at the hotel restaurant and a helpful reception (thanks again to Mohamed for the excellent service at my last stay). Check in and out was very comfortable and everything was prepared in advance as requested. Will definitely come back again."
1922,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Stayed with family in a suite for 2 nights for a wedding. Excellent room, front of house were friendly, polite and attentive. Bar area well stocked. Pool small but clean and well maintained. Sauna large as is the gym area. Would stay again? Need I say anything more. Improvement point - Breakfast can get busy for a small area from 8:30am on Sundays!"
1923,Novotel London Blackfriars,"The staff always answered our questions prior to our visit and really welcomed us on arrival with such enthusiasm. We received welcome drinks due to being silver card holders. They were exceptional with our children and even left balloons and teddies in their room on their birthday. The swimming pool was a brilliant end to our busy day in London. The tube is just on the corner and buses stop straight outside so the location is fantastic. a special mention to the male staff member that checked us in as he was absolutely fantastic and really stood out as he went above and beyond. The only slight let down was breakfast, I wouldn't do it again as it was quite disappointing. I would definitely visit here again if I was travelling on public transport, unfortunately no discounted…"
1924,Novotel London Blackfriars,"The hotel is really pretty and located in a safe areq. Staff were helpful upon arrival and allowed me to be located on a lower floor due to my fear of lifts. The spa was great, decent size pool and a sauna, however the pool was quite cold 🥲 comfy beds, no noise from other rooms, private, big bathroom. This would have been a 5 star review apart from the fact that there was dirt on our bed sheets and no sign of dusting on the shelves (nothing major to cry about, but after paying £310 for one night these things shouldn’t be an issue). Also not amazing that they offer two free bottles of sparkling water in the mini fridge but no still. Overall though, had a lovely stay. Novotel is one of my favourite hotels to stay at and is up there with Raddison Blu, Petsana."
1925,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Stayed for a few days in the hotel. The location is prime. Right near the bridge. Underground station is very close 2 min. Walk across the bridge to workplaces takes 10-15 min. Sightseeing places are very close. The checkin was smooth. Payment in advance. Exec room is good. Expected facilities. Breakfast spread was good. Staff were warm and cheerful. Room was well cleaned. They have a gym and a swimming pool. While I didn’t use them I did see other guests there. Bar and restaurant were good. A complementary drink was offered. While there seemed business visitors during the week, it was well occupied on the weekend with families. Checkout was smooth."
1926,Novotel London Blackfriars,"I’ve stayed at this hotel around 10 times ever since it opened in 2012, and I’ve had great experiences until now. Since the pandemic it really feels like the service has gone downhill. Firstly, on check in I was asked to pay the full balance in advance. I’m an Accor Diamond member, and the hotel already has my card on file! This meant that no account was opened for me and I had to pay for the restaurant separately. The receptionist was not particularly friendly or helpful either. I was lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive room on the 12th floor on account of my status. The room has a balcony with incredible views, but apart from this it’s now starting to look tired which is a shame. Small details were missed: Toiletries upside down, water thrown in fridge. …"
1927,Novotel London Blackfriars,We saved up to have a great weekend in London and booked Novotel following the great recommendations. It was not worth it. Just one of unfortunately many examples: I had tried to talk to them at the middle of our stay that no one had come to clean our room and the lady at the reception asked whether I was sure whether no one had come to clean our room over the past 2 days. I do not know whether she truly felt it is possible someone had come yet made such a little difference that I would not have noticed them being there... Save your money for a hotel that truly is interested in hosting you.
1928,Novotel London Blackfriars,"It was our first time in London. End of August, almost all hotels are busy. It was important for us to find a hotel in a convenient location. at a reasonable price. And the choice fell on Novotel London Blackfriars Intuition did not fail us. From arrival to departure everything was top notch. Location is very convenient The room is big enough Very clean great view of the city from the window. Service at a high level Metro and buses nearby you can walk to many attractions. A minute walk from the hotel there is a Cut street with many cafes and restaurants in the evening it is very pleasant and tasty to sit there. But the best part is the hotel staff. who helped and cared for everything. I would like to especially note Alberto Biollino for His patience and desire to help. Next…"
1929,Novotel London Blackfriars,We had the most perfect weekend - absolutely all of the staff were so professional and friendly. The standard of cleanliness and comfort in the hotel was exceptional and our room had everything that we needed with no noise or disturbance - we will be back.
1930,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Room air conditioning was not functioning and reception did nothing to help. Horrible service, reception was rude with her comment on the complain. Requested for a fan which was not delivered, dont even think the reception did her job of passing the message. Disappointed Novotel, this is not the expectation of a 4 star hotel"
1931,Novotel London Blackfriars,"I don't know why, but I seem to veer toward Southwark when it comes to finding hotel accommodations in London. The last hotel we stayed at was the stylish CitizenM nearby. The general area doesn't feel as congested as anything north of the Thames, the hub tube stations like Southwark and Waterloo are conveniently close, and there are a lot of cool sights a stroll away like Borough Market and the Tate Modern. Novotel has a dozen hotels around town, but the one on Blackfriars Road seemed like the best location. For the three days Jamie W. and I were staying in London, that was indeed the case because walking distances to our various destinations were manageable even in the blistering heat. We reserved a Superior Queen room for $275. Accommodations were quite comfortable and…"
1932,Novotel London Blackfriars,Overall the stay was ok. The facility’s were good room was good. The staff however we’re rude and made us feel uncomfortable. Whenever we asked for something it seemed to inconvenience them. Asked for some fresh towels and they were rude about that. Also ordered a wine to the room which took 45 mins and the staff were awkward about bringing it up and were so rude to us. One of my friends was almost refused entering the hotel after simply leaving to go for a meal and was asked for id upon return even though they had seen us leave and return and knew we were guests. She almost had to Kip on the streets ! Also jacuzzi was ever so cold could of done with being a few degrees warmer my friend came out shivering she had to sit in the sauna for a good half hour to get back to normal…
1933,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Our stay at Novotel London Blackfriars was perfect. Everything was good. We got upgraded to the Executive level. We love the room, the mattress was very comfortable, the air conditioning was perfect for the hot weather in London in August. All the staff are friendly and reacted quickly for any requests. Thank you very much for the outstanding service. Hope to see you next time."
1934,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Room was on the first floor and was small and in need of an update with skirting coming away from the wall, dirty marks on the walls and stained carpet. The main bed was uncomfortably hard causing my wife and I some discomfort and back pain. Kids beds were made up like 2 camp beds from the sofa bed in the room. On arrival the curtains were drawn over the window, no wonder. The view was of an industrial door on a brick wall. Housekeeping was hit and miss, we had to request towels, toilet rolls and the other extras on several occasions during our stay. There was an intermittent random but loud humming noise that kept waking us up every night and smoke alarms went off one night. We had originally asked for a room change higher up with a view but were told the hotel was fully…"
1935,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Weekend away with husband and the Hotel was lovely - we were upgraded which was a lovely surprise and the staff were great, professional and friendly. The room was great and facilities in the hotel were of high standard.The Hotel is situated in a great place and within walking distance of the sights of London and would defiantly recommend."
1936,Novotel London Blackfriars,The ladies at the reception desk were very helpful when I asked them if I could get a page photocopied to attach to something I was taking to the next door post office. I was really relieved they agreed to help a stranger in need. Service with a smile 🙂
1937,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Hotel is on good spot close to underground station.Walking distance to London Eye, Hotel staff friendly and very helpful, Nice swimming pool, good restaurant food, Breakfast excellent, Room moderate but carpet very very dirty stains all over the place, to management please check room 610 for deatels"
1938,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Stayed with the family for 3 nights , What a lovely Hotel (Absolutely spotless ), nice comfortable double bed and two single beds ( No sofa beds Thank you) great restaurant , what a great breakfast experience, amazing fruit salad & fab food, nice attentive dining room staff , especially Rodney , also the ( Romanian )bar tender was really top class, nice safe swimming pool in the basement ( only 1.2 metre deep)"
1939,Novotel London Blackfriars,"We had a great stay with a nice breakfast and very friendly staff, especially Alberto at the check-in. We didn’t get to use the pool but it looked lovely. The bed was comfy and the room was very clean. We would surely come back. The location was convenient as it was nearby several tube stations."
1940,Novotel London Blackfriars,Our first time in London and I couldn’t of had a better experience! Our stay at Novotel was amazing honestly I can’t wait to return. We had a really nice spacious rooms and the beds were really comfy. English breakfast was delicious although the coffee from the machine wasn’t the best. Big thank you to reception as they were really nice from the moment we got in to the moment we left. Also a big shout out to Charlotte on the bar who was just amazing! She looked after me and my family well. Also we missed his name but the man in the black shirt was amazing too! Every time I came to the bar I didn’t even need to tell her what i wanted she just remembered! Overall we are very pleased with the experience here and definitely recommend it!!
1941,Novotel London Blackfriars,A few things drove me nuts about this hotel but overall we’ve had a decent / good stay. Pros: location is central but quiet (Southwark is a chill tube station). The pool is fun and has a nice sauna. The restaurant is okay and the service was great. The hotel is clean and modern. The gym is okay albeit a little dated. Hotel security is excellent. Cons: our room was cramped. The bathroom is behind a glass wall that lights up like Times Square when someone goes to the bathroom at night ( a really bad design). We fumbled around with cell phone glow so we would not wake each other. Shower floods the bathroom with water so you have to use towels to mop it up. No conditioner when we got here?!? Came after night 1 but the girls were not thrilled. Use of the pool requires a ridiculous…
1942,Novotel London Blackfriars,I was upgraded and enjoyed my stay at the executive level 13 having very comfortable corner room with a nice view. In the room everything is set to let you feel relaxed. Nice and professional reception and bar staff ! I’ll come back for sure.
1943,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Nice location, conveniently close to Southwark tube station. Lotsa nice places in the vicinity for grabbing a bite and a glass. Friendly & helpdul staff, really nice and godd-sized rooms, pool & fitness area a BIG boon!!"
1944,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Great Service, very helpful people and a great location near Southwark Underground Station. Make sure to visit Borough Market while you're there. Room was as avertised and we thought it to be a great deal for an otherwise rather pricy city."
1945,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Stay’d there for three nights. They have great staff, very service oriented. Everything clean, nice gym, good location etc. The best thing however is that they have Hypoallergenic rooms which are really helpful for people with allergies or other related challenges. And it really works."
1946,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Great location in the heart of all that London has to offer. Walk or take public transport to all the sights. Beautiful, modern, spotlessly clean rooms and very high level of service from all of the staff. Special thanks to the restaurant staff who went out of their way to look after my daughter’s dietary needs (celiac disease). Would not hesitate to stay there again on next visit to London."
1947,Novotel London Blackfriars,"We had a good time staying at the hotel. Good location for the tube, clean rooms and friendly staff. Big shout out goes to Emy who was brilliant and super helpful at breakfast sorting us out with non dairy milk for both me and my little boy snd couldn't be more friendly! Thank you 😊"
1948,Novotel London Blackfriars,"Our company's conference week was hosted at this Novotel and each of us (we were a group of 20) agreed that the service and facilities were absolutely brilliant. This extended to the restaurant and front desk staff. The conference facilities were very good, the food was tasty and the staff were all amazing! Our stay was very well organised. A huge thank you to Francisco and Mercedes ( Conference and Group Management)!"
1949,Novotel London Blackfriars,"I stayed in the hotel, with my family, for a week (last week). First of all the staff were always friendly and helpful. Although, as the staff told me, the hotel was full, it was very quiet indeed. The room was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was served at the Jamboree restaurant which is part of the hotel, the restaurant is very nice and the breakfast was really rich and of good quality. I also went to the hotel gym which is well equipped Definitely a very very good hotel"
1950,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"My friend and I originally booked an Indian-inspired afternoon tea via Groupon for May. I was then ill but the hotel was very accommodating and rescheduled our reservation for June. I arrived a bit early and was welcomed to sit in the lounge section before the restaurant opened at 1pm. Andie and Steve were great, very attentive and made us feel welcome, nothing was too much trouble - they came over the table to check we were ok, topped up our Prosecco regularly and offered us tea. The dining area was a nice size, small enough to feel boutique but not so small it felt cramped. The tables were well-spaced and the area nicely decorated. The food was delicious and well-flavoured with a nice range. Very good value, even more so with Groupon voucher. Definitely recommend!"
1951,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"We came for the Indian Inspired Afternoon Tea and it was delicious! The hotel is chic, fresh and contemporary. Andie and Steve were attentive, without being intrusive and made sure we had a memorable experience. We definitely recommend a visit and we will be returning!"
1952,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"We attended the Park Grand, London for afternoon tea. Food was delicious and beautifully presented. A special mention for our waiter. Andie who is a credit to the hotel. He looked after us in an unobtrusive way but made sure we had everything we needed. He was a polite, friendly young man and helped make our visit so enjoyable."
1953,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Had a lovely afternoon tea at the Park Grand Hotel and was served by Andie. He was very courteous and kept our glasses topped up with bubbly. He also explained everything to us. All in all, a lovely afternoon tea."
1954,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Enjoyed an afternoon tea. Excellent service provided by Andie. Attention to detail was excellent and explained our choices very clearly. Scones were Devine! Ours also included a bottle of Prosecco which was again excellent. Certainly recommend. Good location to Kensington Gardens.
1955,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Colston was incredibly helpful and offered fantastic service. The room was nice and clean, comfy bed. Enjoyed my stay and great location just a few minutes walk from Paddington and Hyde park - would definitely stay again"
1956,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Lovely afternoon tea served by Steve . Well presented and good service. Pleasant air conditioned room. Processco included. Good position near Paddington walking distance. Would recommend. Worth a visit
1957,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Andie and Steve was amazing!! They were very good!! They were very friendly and checked on us if everyone was okay!! Very good service!!They did a superb job!!The food was amazing! Delicious!! Superb job!!
1958,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Excellent stay at the hotel in London while attending an awards ceremony. Room was spacious and contained everything I needed for my stay. The customer service was superb with nothing too much of a problem with Colston being very attentive. Would recommend a stay here.
1959,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"My room is absolutely tiny and reeks of mildew. I was very disappointed when I walked in. I am basically in the basement, and will worry about my ground floor window being perfect for anyone who wants to break in... Definitely NOT what I was expecting for the amount I paid for the room!"
1960,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Perfect location close to 2 underground stations. Nice and comfortable atmosphere, clean and convenient rooms and the best hotel bed I’ve ever tried. Accommodating staff, especially Laura and Maithilee, but also others whose names I didn’t get. Fair priced too. Altogether, it means that I would pick this hotel, if I go to London again someday."
1961,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"The, afternoon tea was delicious, our waiter Andie, was very pleasant and attentive. It was a most enjoyable experience. The restaurant is bright, modern and the tables are very well spaced. We were there for three hours chatting, eating and enjoying our bottle of Prosecco."
1962,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Booked for Saturday afternoon tea using a gift voucher. Steve was our server. He was perfect, really looking after us and the other afternoon tea visitors. Sandwiches were fresh and tasty, the cakes were scrummy and we really liked the little scones. The hotel is a perfect location for a short walk to Paddington Station. Our afternoon tea experience was a perfect end to a lovely weekend in London."
1963,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,I must say that the hotel is exceptionally good. I had a very good stay in the hotel. It was exceptionally comfortable. I would especially like to mention Maithilee and Moselle who took great care of hospitality and Mr. Colston and Steve who took great care of good. We were astonished that on request they even got Indian good cooked for us. Its s homely place and I’d suggest one to definitely stay here.
1964,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Came for Afternoon Tea, food was beautiful and the service from Steve was 10/10. The whole experience was nice and relaxing and will definitely be coming again. I highly recommend coming here. Thank you"
1965,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Steve was the best. Very polite and attentive. Lovely afternoon cream tea with a friend for my birthday. Prosecco was very tasty. Easily found from tube station. Clean and tidy. Did feel more like a breakfast room than a tea room but was very contemporary.
1966,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Afternoon tea was great fun. Steve was soooo polite and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble and he was very attentive. Great selection and the prosecco was delicious. 5 minute walk from Paddington Station and the Jubilee Line.
1967,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Revised: First the staff there was really nice and the place was clean. But our room looked nothing like the photographs. Our room was at the end of a hall, very dark, no internet. We had an uncomfortable double bed that crowded the room. The microwave did not function properly. We had booked a standard room but really?? Glad we were only staying one night. After we we returned home, we were contacted by management about our first review and were offered a 50% refund on our charge. They seemed sincerely concerned that we were not happy about our stay with them. There are great rooms here, just be sure that you ask for one. I'll bump the review up one more star for the concern of management. I must leave other things that were said before because they are true."
1968,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Third time here. Never disappoints. I would highly recommend a visit for afternoon tea. It was our 40th wedding anniversary and was a perfect afternoon to celebrate. Andie was excellent, very attentive and polite. A++++"
1969,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Great afternoon tea!! We had a lovely waiter called Andie. We would definitely go back! The service was quick in a clean location. Nice sandwiches, fresh scones and tasty deserts. Thank you very much!"
1970,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Our visit was for afternoon tea. The staff can not be faulted, friendly and welcoming. The afternoon tea was average, presentation good. Sandwiches were good but the scones are disappointing. The scones (2 each) are the size of small biscuits and quite tasteless. Then the top layer two very small carrot cakes, 2 very small lemon tart and 2 small chocolate mousse in a glass. Glass of Prosecco was refreshing. I would not return. But like I mentioned the service was good."
1971,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Very nice and friendly staffs, very helpful, the room so clean and tidy , location also the best especially those come from Asia countries , there are number of Asian Restaurent including the famous Tukdin Restaurent which only a minute walking distance . Obsoletely wil stay here again for the future trip to London"
1972,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,I came here with my family and the team were very accommodating for me and my family. For my wife's birthday. I had my 1 year old and my 14 year old and my wife. The person who served us the whole time was called Andie and his service was excellent. He was polite he always checked in with us that we were fine and was always willing whatever request we had. He only cares about us being comfortable and me and the family really appreciated it. The afternoon tea was very nice and the whole experience was amazing mainly thanks to Andie and the quality of the food. I would highly recommend coming here
1973,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Please persevere with this venue. The admin is awful. I tried to book my afternoon tea by email but no answer. I then tried by phone and despite there being an option (3), I was advised that afternoon tea cannot be booked over the phone. I then sent another email and finally received confirmation as I was sitting in the hotel front garden enjoying my afternoon tea! Indeed, when I arrived, my booking was not registered! However, all is not bad. On my arrival, the staff were welcoming and Seb was particularly courteous and helpful. The service was prompt and the food was excellent. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I would recommend this venue for afternoon tea (and prosecco). That said, persevere with the admin - it is worth it!"
1974,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Due to the receptionist Mr Colston we had an excellent stay. Upon arrival we were presented with a small room although I had booked and payed for a Superior. In the evening we mentioned this to Mr Colston who told us we would have another room next day, and on top he moved our luggage during the day"
1975,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"We had a reservation but we needed to make changes- and needed assistance with a wheelchair- the staff- Steve, and others were able to switch plans and were immensely helpful. The food was FANTASTIC, and the service was competent and kindly. Would absolutely go there again!"
1976,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"We arrived on rainy day after a long overnight flight from the states. We were greeted at the curb and were helped with our bags into the lobby. The front desk agent was lovely and got us checked in right away. They had actually booked us into a 2nd floor room, but my husband has had knee replacement surgery and stairs are a bit difficult for him. There is a lift available but a ground floor room was just easier for us. They graciously changed our room to a ground floor one and carried our bags to our room. The room was on the smaller side by US standards, but well appointed and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet with no disruptions from people upstairs or going down the hallway outside our room. We were always greeted warmly by staff when returning from…"
1977,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Great staff ,so helpful, generous and friendly especially front desk employees, Maithilee and colston were amazing many thanks for them Very clean hotel , nice location in central London , good facilities but the only drawback is small room"
1978,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Nice and clean venue, the staff were friendly. There was a clam atmosphere. Prompt service. We were served by Riva who was very lovely and helpful. We had the Indian afternoon tea with a bottle of processco."
1979,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,It is great place and it deserves a visit also it near by public transportation where you can get any bus or train and head to your destination. Colston is a great person and he helps a lot during your check in and out
1980,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"The best part of our stay is the lovely breakfast provided by Laura and Steve. Laura is delightful with a beautiful smile. Makes the whole room light up. I slept so well in the comfortable bed and the shower was amazing, especially after two days of traveling with no sleep. Everyone greets you with a smile and makes you feel quite important."
1981,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Had a lovely afternoon tea which was given as a gift refill our son. Riva was very attentive and looked after us very well. A lovely day and beautifully presented food which was delicious. Along with our bottle of Prosecco too. Would recommend
1982,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"What a wonderful afternoon tea. The staff at the hotel were very courteous and helpful from start to finish. Andie was a brilliant waiter, nothing was too much trouble for him. He was very attentive without being over the top. A true credit to the hotel. The afternoon tea was one of the best I have ever tasted. The sandwiches were delicious and so so fresh. The scones, cakes and chocolate mousse were to die for and all washed down with a bottle of prosecco. I would highly recommend going here for Afternoon tea. A big shout out to Andie, such a lovely member of staff. I would go back and would try the Indian Afternoon tea next time."
1983,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"If you are looking for a birthday celebration and catch up with friends then I can recommend afternoon tea. Relaxing venue and clean. Good value for money. The staff was helpful and friendly, specially Steve, thank you!"
1984,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"The room was nice enough, slightly small but clean, all amenities you’d expect, a comfortable bed and a good bathroom for the size. The disappointing part of the stay is the room service food. I tried to order and got told the Indian chef was on leave so most of the menu was not available. I ordered Chicken Caesar Salad and a burger. What could go wrong with that order. Turns out all of it. Under cooked chicken on a bed of soggy old lettuce (that was all in the salad) then a burger that looked ok from the outside but was so under cooked and red there was barely any brown meat at all. Fair to say I went to bed hungry."
1985,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Colston was a good host who was polite and handled all my queries and requests with patience. If I had to give him rating I would have given 5/5. I would recommend friends coming over to the hotel and connect with him for a great hospitality experience
1986,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Andie served us with discreet efficiency and great charm. He explained the variety of dishes, and made the whole experience delightful. We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, and will remember this afternoon’s party"
1987,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Andie has been excellent, he has made us very comfortable, very well spoken. Was attentive through out the whole time during our afternoon tea session. The food was lovely. Overall 5 star experience."
1988,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Boutique hotel- fabulous solo rooms tiny but somehow had everything u needed Staff from breakfast to front desk were great! Colston - front desk was so accommodating always w a smile & research whatever my needs were An asset to the Park Grand Lancaster Gate
1989,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,We travelled into London from California and on way up to Manchester. So glad I found this little gem. My husband is British and he raved about the English breakfast and how well they did the poached eggs. My son enjoyed meeting the staff and being spoiled by little cakes and candies each time we came in or left too. If you read other reviews you will notice the rooms are small but well appointed and the bathroom/shower is not for anyone big and tall. These things did not bother us as we have visited London many times and know about the space constraints. The location was steps away from a row of restaurants… we missed curries so we tried a new curry place each night! It’s also right next to Hyde Park and Kensington Palace and only a few blocks from Paddington station. We walked…
1990,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"A really conveniently located hotel by the Paddington station, it's also well maintained with nice staff and a good culinary choice.can be a bit pricey but hey it's London after all. The rooms were a bit small but we'll equipped, the bath was clean and well kept"
1991,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Went for afternoon tea here with my fiancé. The food was very tasty, the tea and Prosecco were good, and the service was excellent. Inside, the decor was slightly basic, otherwise it was a wonderful experience. Would definitely recommend to others."
1992,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Myself and 2 friends went for afternoon tea on Friday 19 May 2023 at Park Grand at were delighted with the cleanliness of the hotel, quality of the sandwiches, scones and sweets (and also the Prosecco of course). I hadn’t mentioned that we didn’t like egg beforehand, but he had no problem in changing the filling for us. We were served by Seby who was polite, friendly and knowledgeable and made our trip into a pleasure. Thank you so very much. Christine, Lynda and Chris"
1993,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"This afternoon tea was so lovely! Not only was the food delicious, the service was impeccable. The hotel was beautiful as well. Steve and Saby were an absolute delight. Can’t wait to come back to try the Indian tea next time!"
1994,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Went here using a voucher for afternoon Tea. This is a short walk from Lancaster Gate Tube Station. Be aware there is another Park Grand Hotel a stones throw away, but no great deal. The staff were very pleasant and the afternoon tea was very nice with finger sandwiches, scones, cakes. Our waiter very pleasant and offered to take photo. The room was traditional but very modern, I know that does not make sense, all very clean. We have had a few afternoon teas and this was nice."
1995,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"I've been trying to book an afternoon tea for the past two days. Painful, beyond belief. Firstly, told that I couldn't book at the time, I rang. Rang, back between 10 & 5 as requested, to be told I needed to email. Emailed and no response. Phoned again, for the voice mail to be full. Completely ridiculous and unprofessional"
1996,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Lovely afternoon tea served by Andie who was very polite and accommodating. Food was very nice especially the scones which were very light. Great location which is nice and quiet but minutes from London Paddington
1997,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"Great staff, especially Maithilee and Arslan. The breakfast was very nice and the lication next to the park amazing. I have been only struggljng with the carda to the rooms but Service promised to fix it. One Last Point of improvement is guving people with infants rooms with no many stairs."
1998,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,Great service. Really attentive table service from Steve! He couldn’t have done more! I was a lovely day so we asked to sit outside which was no trouble at all. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a relaxed afternoon tea. Many thanks
1999,Park Grand London Lancaster Gate,"The was a birthday treat for our daughter. We had a voucher for afternoon tea with bubbles. Our server Katy was very pleasant, we got to choose which teas we wanted and she explained what the afternoon tea consisted of. Riva was also pleasant and poured our bubbles perfectly. We thoroughly enjoyed our tea and the ice cream was wonderful. Thank you."
2000,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"The location is absolutely perfect not only for being close to the underground but at a location that is generally 2-3 stops from most things you need. The rooms are small with limited space for belongings which is typical for London and more than adequate. The staff is excellent. I have tried a few places and at a reasonable price point you can’t beat this hotel for its cleanliness, comfort, excellent breakfast, excellent staff and perfect location. Absolutely will return"
2001,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Pros: breakfast included and decent, clean, location decent (though not very close to major attractions), friendly staff, room has safe, bed comfortable Cons: ambient noise very loud (not sure if heating system or water), no small fridge, no plugs in bathroom for shavers or hair dryers, shower poor water pressure, no USB plugs in bedroom which should be standard for the cost."
2002,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"We stayed here for 3 nights while in London and loved it. It was clean with very comfortable beds. Rooms are spacious, especially for London. We had an issue with the air conditioner and they moved us without a problem. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Before booking I was worried about location and if it would be easy to access everything or would it feel disconnected. It doesn’t. The neighborhood around Waterloo Station is vibrant and full of restaurants/pubs and it’s easy walking distance to the river - and the Underground is so easily accessible and can get you anywhere quickly. Highly recommend."
2003,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Wonderful staff Good service They got me a taxi on a Saturday morning June 3 to go the airport when the earlier reception had said that there were no taxis available Breakfast was very good Prompt attention to the House Keeping problems
2004,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Our family had an excellent stay here. The location near Waterloo station was perfect. Rooms have everything you need and the breakfast was quite good. When we asked for an extra towel or pillow, we never waited for more than 5 minutes. Staff was friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the bed. It was old and my back did not do well on it. I know they are renovating and I hope new mattresses are in order."
2005,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Pros: (1) good breakfast (2) clean (3) safe enough area (4) near Waterloo tube station which can get you almost anywhere (5) good value for Hilton points/price (6) one of only hotels I could find with sleeping accommodations for 3rd person for a reasonable price (7) has a bar and restaurant on site (8) great hair dryer (9) in room safe (10) lots of options for dining within a 10 minute walk Cons: (1) location - let me explain - in some ways it is good because it is centrally located and a 20-30 minute journey to almost anywhere you would want to go. On the other hand, it is a 20-30 minute journey to almost everything. There was nothing we really had on our itinerary on this side of the river. Everything was a trek. It was difficult to stop back by the hotel for a rest or…"
2006,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Although there is a warning of them building an extension this is most certainly not the problem. About 2300 on the first night I had a continuous high pitch tone until 0600 the following morning. When I called staff up about the problem they informed me that it was because the hotel has bad water pressure and it’s when people are taking showers or flushing the toilet. Yet this was continuous. I had to move rooms after the first night and again in this new room I still had the same problem. So make sure you ask for a room specifically away from the water pressure cupboards. The room itself is nice and you are able to claim a £5 (max of 2) if you skip room cleaning for that day which is one benefit. The breakfast is good with lots of variety, however we incurred problems…"
2007,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Family room. We experienced the window not opening in the room, and smelling was bad. Breakfast did not meet the expectances of a person not wishing for bakeries or oil fried products. Unfortunatelly, not a great experince."
2008,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"We stayed here for about 6 nights during our stay in the London area. It was more reasonably priced than some others in the area, and a clean, comfortable place to come back to after full days of sightseeing. Although a bit dated and starting to look run-down, the hotel is having some renovations done; I'd be interested to see what changes they make. Pros and cons: Pros: * Great location. Within walking distance of the Tube, the National and Globe theatres, restaurants, and many attractions. * Comfortable beds, and reasonably quiet. * We were able to adjust the room temperature to our preference. (I count this as a plus, since we don't always find this to be the case in hotels.) * Plenty of choices for the breakfasts; several nice espresso machines; attentive breakfast area…"
2009,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Friendly staff, great food and clean rooms. Felt welcome from the first step through the door. Conveniently located near Waterloo railway station with view and walking distance to the London Eye. Great location and comfortable stay."
2010,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"I recently stayed at this hotel for 1 night in April. The hotel is in a perfect location and very accessible to both public buses, trains, and subways. The room was clean and it had all of the amenties needed for 1 night. The check in was effecient and quick."
2011,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Excellent hotel in perfect location for River Thames and London Eye. V comfortable, quiet rooms. Good breakfast with plenty of choice. Staff are very friendly and helpful and the whole place has a relaxed atmosphere, despite city centre location!"
2012,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Amazing kind helpful staff, great breakfast with many varieties. We were able to check in early and got a wonderful room! Clean, spacious, great location!! Would definitely stay here again. They also let us keep our luggage there at a safe place after checkout!"
2013,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Stayed for one night when attending the Coronation Concert as this hotel is conveniently situated just a 2-3 minute walk from Waterloo Station which connects London with Windsor. I had some reservations about the location of the hotel as this is by no means the prettiest part of London but in its defence there are plenty of convenience stores and coffee shops nearby, and the area felt safe enough. Check in was polite, courteous and efficient. The twin room was quiet, clean, nicely air conditioned, very well presented and very comfortable. One very minor issue was that both beds were a little squeaky when turning in them. The inclusive breakfast buffet was very impressive, offering a wide selection of quality hot and cold items. Even at the latter stages of the serving period…"
2014,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"It's a 3 star hotel. Can't expect more. The staff has been polite and friendly. It doesn't need anything more than a smile,which the staff do. Guess hilton try to maintain the reputation. The break fast was OK and different options. Over all I had a good experience"
2015,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"We stayed here for a week while visiting London. The location of the hotel is great. Less than a 5 minute walk to the Waterloo station where you can catch the tube or the train. It is also about a 15 minute walk to Westminster Bridge. The rooms are on the small size (smaller than a cruise ship cabin) but the bathroom is a good size. Beds were comfortable. Nice big towels in the bathroom. The breakfast was great, with lots of things to choose from. The hotel does ask that you give them a time you will come for breakfast each morning, to try to spread out the dining times. It is definitely busier late morning, but we never had an issue getting seated. Breakfast was served from 6-11 each morning. This was our 2nd time staying at the hotel. We did notice that our room needed…"
2016,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"I travel for work (and pleasure) a lot, and this hotel was one of the best overall experiences at a Hilton that I've had in the past 12 months (second only to the Waldorf in New Orleans, LA, USA). For starters, the location is perfect. The Hampton is practically across the street from the train station, taxi stand, and bus stops, and walking distance to the Eye and Waterloo Bridge, making it VERY convenient to get around. We felt safe walking around. Also, the neighborhood is full of diverse places to eat. We especially enjoyed the Korean mart across the street and Fishcoteque. The hotel itself is very clean. It has a bar (Nicolette is a fabulous bartender!) that's open late and a restaurant. My teen daughters enjoyed the pizza as a late night snack and used the credit for…"
2017,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"I'm currently in the middle of a stay here. The staff are great, and the location is right in the heart of London. But being right in the heart of London, I would have expected the Internet service to be at least better than an old dial up connection. I cannot believe how bad the internet service is here. They have an open wifi, with no password, so I assume every freeloader in every adjacent building is also taxing this network, but it's totally unusable. Otherwise, it's great."
2018,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Stayed here for 2 nights. Very expensive and overpriced for what it is. Not sure if breakfast is included in price as it was booked via third party. No USB in room which is pretty standard now in most hotels. Room was large and clean, mattress very firm but I didn’t mind that. Very close to Waterloo station. Curtains in room don’t fully close so light in room during night. Breakfast very poor, quality of ingredients not very good. Sausages awful bacon very tough. Wouldn’t stay here again when visiting London. There are far better options for much less cost."
2019,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Good location 5 minutes walk from Waterloo station and 1 minute from the old vic theatre. Hotel clean, modern feel. Check in was relaxed and quick. Stayed over weekend. Room was standard size, not spacious but adequate. Chose a ‘city view’ but a view of The Shard doesn’t really cut it for me so a little disappointed. Large wall mounted toiletries, walk in shower, ironing board, kettle, hairdryer. Breakfast was amazing, the hotel was very busy and restaurant was packed out, yet the breakfast staff were incredible at keeping the tables cleared, escorting you to a table, food all topped up and hot and for the quantity of guests the breakfast was fantastically organised so kudos to the team. Lots of choice available to suit everyone. Wifi free. Hilton app for digital key worked…"
2020,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Great location close to Waterloo Station. Staff pleasant and helpful. Our room was spotless, all credit to the housekeeping staff. Had a great view of the city from our room on the 8th floor, which made our stay even more enjoyable. We would happily stay here again."
2021,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Great location! Walking distance to BIg Ben, Parliament, Westminster Abbey, pretty safe to walk around as well. Nice clean room, comfortable bed, a good breakfast was included. The elevators could be better, I found a couple of times where they refused to move up to the next floor until you open/close the door again."
2022,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Great location with the greatest staffs. I'd like to shot out Giada's exceptional kindness. She's took time to explain the museums nearby that my 9yo son might likes. Her gesture so genuinely kind and caring 💗 Not to mention I ended up having her extra work to switch the payment method for three different bookings with partial points too. She and Mehid were so helpful. We'll definitely coming back to this hotel for the future London trip again!
2023,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Great stay minus the moths and bugs in the carpet and room and the rat in the wall I stayed here for 26 nights and Crystal at reception was a great member of staff but unfortunately I had moths and some kind of bug biting me in my sleep and the hotel didn’t believe me so I had to get proof for them to actually believe me despite the maintenance agreeing there was these bugs and then the final straw was a rat inside of the wall next to my bed scratching and knowing away all night and so I had to leave the hotel early and come to a different hotel oh and the WiFi was super slow despite them saying they had fixed it multiple times so if you really need fast WiFi this isn’t the one for you
2024,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Excellent location, always clean, tidy and friendly staff. Beds comfortable and fantastic shower. Breakfast is hot, tasty and plenty of variety. Highly recommend this hotel and will certainly be back."
2025,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"The hotel is very well located and strategically close to Waterloo metro station. The rooms are organized, have all the necessary structure and are clean. The breakfast is excellent, with many varieties. The service is top notch."
2026,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"We stayed here for one night as our daughter was running in the half marathon. Our room was a queen city view room, it overlooked the construction that is going on but we could see some views, I do think these rooms should be slightly discounted until the construction is finished. The room was clean, comfy and very quiet as it was the weekend and no work going on. We were able to put luggage in their secure storage area. Breakfast was buffet style with a large selection although there was limited availability for our grandson who is dairy free. We booked breakfast for 7.30 and it was relatively quiet although later we noticed a very large queue waiting for tables. The hotel was a few minutes walk from Waterloo"
2027,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"I must admit, I wan’t quite sure what to expect staying at this Hampton, as I am typically a Hilton guy. Will it be nice? Will it be quiet? My stay was excellent all around, and will look to the Hampton Waterloo in the future. My room - on the 7th floor was clean and had most everything I needed. The check-in/check-out was efficient, friendly, and very welcoming. While I was unable to trade advantage of the breakfast, it smelled good and the area was full of patrons and full plates. My room (I think 745) was on the end of the hallway and very quiet. I would suggest the maintenance team have a look at the curtains - they could use a refresh. I do want to congratulate the Hampton on an innovative sustainability program. In the room, I was given the option of not having my room…"
2028,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"First impressions were quite positive due to the location near to the Old Vic Theatre and the lobby and bar area looked inviting. I had originally booked a family room as my teenage son was going to come with my husband and I but then couldn't due to University work. So my husband and I decided to stay a second night and I booked the second night in a double room. When we arrived, I explained this to the concierge and asked if we would need to move to a different room on the second night. He said that we were okay to stay in the same room both nights. I accepted this, as the family room entailed a double/twin bed and a pull out sofa bed. On the morning after our first overnight stay, we walked around three miles to Tower Bridge, as I had booked a tour. We were just arriving when…"
2029,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"This hotel is close to the Waterloo train station and tube station. There are also lots of bus lines that make it easy to get around London. It’s walking distance to Westminster, the London Eye, the Imperial War Museum and the Tate Modern. The room was clean and very comfortable with a small but very nice, updated bathroom. There is a restaurant and bar in the lobby and a free breakfast. You do have to make a reservation for breakfast even though it’s free because there’s limited seating in the lobby. The breakfast had a lot of variety. I was very pleased with the comfort, cost and location of this hotel and would stay here again."
2030,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Plus: About 15 mins walk from Waterloo Station and Bridge so easy to get around. Very friendly and helpful staff in all areas. Room was very nice and light. Bed king size and comfy and large fluffy towels in bathroom, lots of mirrors and plug sockets too. Minus: Quite a small hanging space for clothes and no hooks to hang bulky winter coats and nowhere to hang towels in shower room. No shaving mirror nor bottled water. Breakfast was possibly the worst we have ever encountered. A crazy system relying on someone to tell the person checking you in that a table was ready and escorting you there. Unfortunately we waited nearly ten minutes one morning as despite lots of empty tables, no one came to tell the poor person at the desk, and she wasn't allowed to send people there without…"
2031,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"We had a great experience at this hotel. Checkin was easy and the room was good. The breakfast was good for our family. My two kids are allergic to gluten and there were plenty of options for them. The hotel is close to the tube and it was super easy to get anywhere we needed to go. Overall, great experience."
2032,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Great hotel, great location and very friendly staff. Breakfast was great with plenty to choose from and food on a night is good as well if you have the munchies after a long day. Waterloo underground station is only a 5 minute walk away as well."
2033,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Excellent place for London visit. Very close to the Waterloo tube station. Walking distance to Westminster. Clean hotel. Breakfast was very good. Close by restaurants are good for the dinner of your choice.
2034,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Stayed here for 3 nights in February the hotel is in a great location, the room was lovely with great views. Breakfast was good and sets you up for the day. Staff were lovely and very helpful . Would definitely return and recommend."
2035,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Great views, book via the hilton app & you get to choose your room when you check in on line. I chose 802 & the views were amazing. Breakfast was plentiful. Perfect location for visiting the city. Just a short walk from waterloo. Staff were very helpful & continuously cleaning."
2036,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Very good all round stay. Friendly staff, clean rooms, food Wi-Fi and a good breakfast. Location very close to Waterloo station so good for trains and underground. The hotel is busy but all functions well. The rooms are of a decent size, with a shower with a decent pressure and lots of hot water."
2037,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Hated the hotel. It was overpriced compared to what was offered. It was self-serviced, so there was no room service, and I had to take my large luggage up to my room. The room was tiny, the Breakfast was terrible, with no variety, and it did not taste good. The only good thing was it was very central and close to tourist attractions which was what attracted me to it in the first place. London has a great transportation system so if you're worried about a central location, don't worry about it, you'll be able to get around easily. I totally do not recommend this hotel at all."
2038,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Stayed here for my first trip to London. Great location. Very close to Waterloo station so it was very easy to get around the city. The staff were very friendly and my room was nice and quiet. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel if you will be visiting London.
2039,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Spent a night hampton by Hilton Waterloo great location for our night out in town staff was brilliant make you feel very welcome room was perfect with a city view and very clean will look forward to our next time when Iam next in town.
2040,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Check in digitally but welcome was good when picking up free soft drink and snack and pick up the free wifi code. Tidy room with view over to the City. Shower and usual amenities with a comfortable bed Breakfast provided a good range of options but could have benefited from hot plates. Yea coffee cold and bread options For the price excellent value option close to Waterloo
2041,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Super plain breakfast and do not expect that you can order for example porridge (Oatmeal) or an omelette, the breakfast area reminds me about an old and dated school dining room plus that it was overcrowded. In the room the windows could not be opened. The surroundings are really dull as well. I had to switch my room as it smelled like somebody had smoked in the room. I am always wondering how it is possible for the staff to not notice this when the room is being cleaned. Also the corners in the room had probably not seen a vacuum cleaner for some time. The positive thing is that the manager answered regarding my feedback directly to the hotel but of course it all depends on the actions and not the words."
2042,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Several stays now and overall a very poor experience. Things are frequently broken in rooms, the check in staff hassle you to find out what time you’re having breakfast, when you arrive for breakfast you get told you can only have a table for 20 mins, and you’re interrupted at 9am in your room to find out when you’re going to leave. There’s also usually an incorrect over-charge to sort out after, and staff refuse to process refunds on weekends over the phone, or leave you waiting for ages in reception whilst they sort it out. Definitely not a place to trust with rapid check out unless you’ve paid in advance and they don’t have a credit card number for you."
2043,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Very central and withing walking distance of grocers, Train, Tube and City sights. Multiple bus and cab services made all sights just a short distance away. Hotel has pub ad restaurant onsite with huge fish and chips. Pub across street has rooftop dining which is nice in the area."
2044,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"It is very near the waterloo train station. Breakfast was good, our room is small but its very clean and the bed is cozy. Free wifi, free coffee and tea inside the room only unlike the Hampton Inn in the US which has free coffee, hot choco and tea 24/7 at the lobby. There are no fridge and no microwave inside the room. No coin laundry, but they have laundry services. They have a small gym but no pool. The hotel has its our bar restaurant that serves delicious pizzas and chicken wings. Overrall I recommend this hotel."
2045,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"great location, great breakfast. clean. good staff. but just not as modern as a premier inn. makes you wonder what you're paying a premium for? would stay again tho for the right price due to location which if staying in London is really important"
2046,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"Now when I’m staying in London I always choose here, it’s a great location and only a few mins walk to the Waterloo underground and over ground station The staff are really good and you can tell they care, the breakfast is really good Will definitely carry on staying here"
2047,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,"I booked this hotel with trepidation mainly because it’s away from the City and not in the most salubrious of areas. I’ve stayed here before and it was ‘ok’ then, never great. HOWEVER, this time my room was standard and comfortable. Very very clean and well maintained. Bed comfortable. Check in was a bit slow, Hamptons usually are, but all else exceeded expectations. Actually, for me, breakfast wasn’t great, no choice of eggs, but I would still definitely stay here again. Btw: big shout out to the staff, very polite and welcoming. Maybe except the officious lady who hastened me out of my room on departure. Fair enough though - it was 11.55am."
2048,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,the location is very close to city center. breakfast was great. reception and room was very well. the only thing was the sofa bed wasn't very comfort for 2 kids sleeping it can accommodate one child comfortably but two will squeeze in. However we had a good time and the breakfast was great
2049,Hampton by Hilton London Waterloo,Stayed for 2 nights for my boyfriend’s birthday and the horel couldnt do enough for you! They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was as special as possible. Room and view was amazing and the breakfast was great to. Amazing location aswell
2050,Corinthia London,"Beautiful hotel, spacious rooms and brilliant service. Personalise service, staff trained to accommodate guests request. They organised us restaurant reservations, gave us some good tips where to go … Perfect for a weekend in London, very central location ."
2051,Corinthia London,"What a fantastic nights stay. Firstly, the initial check in experience with the reception staff was so friendly and welcoming I knew this was going to be a stay to remember. The room was beautiful and with a gorgeous bottle of complimentary champagne which really topped it off. We had drinks in the Velvet bar before dinner. What a gorgeous sumptuous space this was. The cocktail menu was vast so there would be something for everyone. After a cocktail we ate in Kerridges. Again, a great experience with beautiful food and surroundings. This stay was a treat which will be repeated !!!!"
2052,Corinthia London,"I have stayed once in this hotel and loved it and have been back for dinner/drinks since then. I went with friends who had not been before and I just had to write this as we had such a good time! We were greeted in the lobby by a charming smiling lady and sort of butler beautifully dressed guy and they asked us three "" are you drinking or dining with us this evening?"" ""Both I hope"" I replied! He showed us to to the Velvet Bar which is divine where they had a table free - all low lights, plushy red and gold seats - very very nice. we drank Champagne and all the waiters were smiling and charming even when we knocked over a glass of Champagne! We then asked if we could go to Kerridge's and one of them very obligingly walked over there, confirmed it was okay and then escorted us…"
2053,Corinthia London,Every time I stay in the Corinthia staff go over and above to make every moment special. I've only stayed a few times but they always remember me and manage to make me feel like I am the only person there. It really is an exceptional place with the most incredible staff and stunning rooms. The Northall is always a treat with delicious food and one of the best sommelier's I have come across.
2054,Corinthia London,"Exceptional hotel - superb staff, friendly, helpful and welcoming. Room excellent with everything you could wish for. Our room had a view of the London Eye which was great. Good nights sleep - didn't hear a thing. The velvet bar was great - like stepping back in time to a bygone age of glamour and cocktails."
2055,Corinthia London,"Wonderful Afternoon Tea in The Crystal Moon… beautiful location, very attentive staff - our server Emily was a delight. Everything about our afternoon was delicious and delightful. The sandwiches, scones and cakes were all perfect. Beautiful crockery. The pianist was really good, loved his choice of music. The Corinthia was recommended to us by a friend, and we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend ourselves."
2056,Corinthia London,Just had a breakfast meeting at the Corinthia London and I have to say the service was outstanding. The team in the Northall restaurant and bar were superb and anticipated our needs perfectly. Marta who looked after us in particular delivered impeccable customer service and made me feel a valued guest. She really exceeded my expectations. The venue itself is stunning and the perfect place for a quick meeting or less formal catch up. The food was delicious and service was quick. I will definitely be back. Highly recommended!
2057,Corinthia London,Outstanding experience from the moment we walked in the door through checkout. Great location and excellent service. Family friendly with an excellent concierge desk. Would highly recommend it and we will definitely be back.
2058,Corinthia London,"A wonderful hotel. Excellent location for the river, Westminster and shops. The room was extremely comfortable and the staff were friendly and courteous. The spa was the best I've experienced in London."
2059,Corinthia London,"Best hotel in London? We've been lucky enough to stay in some lovely hotels.. but I think this is the best so far. Outstanding service, absolutely beautiful hotel, ultra clean.. and even smells fantastic. The staff could not do enough for you, our room is the best we've ever stayed in... and yes.. would 100% go back."
2060,Corinthia London,"Wonderful hotel probably one of the best in London and for good reason. Yes it’s big bucks but the service is exceptional. Beautiful rooms huge beds, fabulous toiletries you could just spend all day enjoying the room and spa. Sadly I had to work but loved every minute when I was there!"
2061,Corinthia London,"We visited The Corinthia for afternoon tea with friends. From start to finish it was a special occasion and everything was absolutely perfect. The room which has a stunning light installation, piano playing, excellent service - professional, friendly, nothing was too much trouble. The quality of the sandwich selections , scones, cakes and selection of teas and coffees were second to none. The champagne we choose to start our tea was excellent. The value is exceptional and we would not hesitate to recommend afternoon tea here. This will now be our go-to for afternoon tea in the future. Thank you for making our afternoon so special."
2062,Corinthia London,"The most wonderful weekend in the most incredible hotel. From start to finish the service was impeccable, food incredible & the best experience. All staff are excellent at what they do , so friendly and helpful."
2063,Corinthia London,"We stayed for three nights and found the rooms luxurious and peaceful and the hotel public areas beautifully decorated. Well done to the staff who are attentive, helpful and friendly without being over-bearing or too formal. One or two things were less than perfect…considering the price I would expect breakfast served hot and on hot plates, Though tasty, none of the breakfast food was hot and my partner reported the bacon a little tough and overdone. Breakfast took some time to arrive one morning. Continental breakfast had a very good range of foods as you might expect at this level of five star hotel. The Northall meal we ate was delicious and the Kerridge restaurant also excellent. We had afternoon tea, a lovely experience although we were seated in a slightly strange spot…"
2064,Corinthia London,My wife and I stayed at this amazing hotel on the 25th March celebrating our 20th Anniversary. Everything from the moment we walked in to the moment we reluctantly left was spectacular and exceeded our expectations. Each Bar was fantastic and the food and service in the Northall was exceptional. Thank you to every member of staff for making our first stay at this hotel one we will never forget and trust me... We will be back!!!
2065,Corinthia London,"I would give this hotel 10 stars if possible! I love to stay at nice places. The Corinthia is beautiful! My rooms were immaculate. (I had a suite) The staff is amazing - they go above and beyond to make sure you have a memorial stay. They supplied bottled water, nepresso, candy and every night they put fresh lavender on our pillows. The slippers and robe are so comfortable. My daughter and I had the afternoon tea at the Crystal Lounge. I had informed the staff before we arrived that we have special dietary needs. They went above and beyond to make sure that everything was delicious and beautifully presented. Definitely lots of photo ops! I was also fortunate enough to have a spa treatment. The first thing that I noticed besides the spa being beautiful was the wonderful smell. I…"
2066,Corinthia London,"Stayed the night here to celebrate valentines and to my surprise I was proposed to, my now fiancé couldn’t praise the staff enough on helping him plan the proposal, the room was full of balloons, cake, champagne, roses…the list goes on! Was simply stunning! we had an executive room which was pleasantly spacious, our room included a walk in wardrobe which was a perfect touch, loved everything about this room. We used the valet parking, seamless service and attentive staff. We enjoyed both the northall and velvet bar for drinks would highly recommend both. The winter garden for lunch was absolutely stunning I would say this was the highlight for us, the feeling whilst your dining outside in the winter but so cosy with the most comforting food and drinks is something special,…"
2067,Corinthia London,"This hotel wonderfully combines luxury and warmth. The staff are amazing, they do everything to make your stay comfortable from the start. Our room was very nice, it had a walk in closet, a bathroom with a bath & tv and walk-in shower, the bedroom was huge with an office area and rest area. We started our visit with champagne and oysters in the Northall Bar, again the staff were really excellent here. There is a large and varied cocktail list, good snacks and a vibrant atmosphere with many families stopping off for lunch. Our lunch was in Kerridge’s Bar & Grill also situated at the hotel. This was a real treat and faultless. We ended the evening in the champagne and cocktail bar Velvet, found behind a large velvet drape. It was like stepping back in time to the 1940s, soft…"
2068,Corinthia London,"This is one of the top hotels in London. The rooms are big and modern. The location is central without being loud or touristy. The food and service are 5 star. The extra touches, like the design and set up of the hotel, are excellent. All in all, a top choice! One of the immediate standouts compared to other hotels is the size of the room. We originally booked a Deluxe Room but, on account of our Amex FHR booking, were upgraded to an Executive Room. It was huge. The bed was supremely comfortable, the bathroom was large, the rainfall shower was excellent, and the windows were fully soundproof. The bathroom even had heated floors. One note, while there was good closet space, there was limited drawer space, so just an fyi. The Northall for breakfast is excellent. Both…"
2069,Corinthia London,"We had an absolutely amazing stay. From the welcoming and friendly check in service, to the beautiful and relaxing spa facilities, to the delicious dinner at Kerridge’s (the best fish and chips we’ve ever eaten, every mouthful of the meal was perfect), to the wonderful live music and cocktails in Velvet bar, and then finally my partner saying yes when I proposed at the end of the night, an experience we will never forget. The staff both before we arrived and during could not have been more helpful. Definitely a luxury and expensive treat, but it’s more than worth it if you want to feel truly spoiled and taken care of. I’m sure we’ll be back, we definitely didn’t want to leave! Couldn’t recommend enough."
2070,Corinthia London,"From the moment you step out of the London black cab to when you sadly have to depart we were not disappointed. Attentive, happy smiling staff yet discreet. A special occasion for my wife’s birthday, those little extra touches provided were special. Location could not have been better for us, walked for miles over the long weekend, coming back to rest our weary feet in luxury. Kerridge’s Bar & Grill superb, the Northall Bar for light snacks a must. Afternoon tea on the Sunday before leaving topped it off, wow!!. Thank you Corinthia and team."
2071,Corinthia London,Amazing hotel. Beautiful lobby and very nice rooms. The gym was the best hotel gym I have ever seen! Great location and amazing restaurants and bars. A great place for a high end stay. Make sure to appreciate the gym and afternoon tea! Very close to Trafalgar Square
2072,Corinthia London,"When the General Manager personally welcomes you seconds after you walk through the entrance, you know this is a pretty special place to stay. Jochem Meijerink, thank you for making us feel incredibly welcome and valued from the moment we arrived. Corinthia London is clearly a very well oiled machine and every member of staff we encountered throughout our short stay made us feel very special. Our beautiful suite was wonderful and the little touches in the room made it so inviting. Beautiful fresh flower arrangements, wonderful books to read and a gorgeous cashmere blanket on the bed. The spa is something very special indeed. First class facilities and the ultimate secluded hideaway to completely switch off and relax in. Thank you to the therapist Vera for being so kind and…"
2073,Corinthia London,"This hotel was a delight. Stayed in a Garden Suite that was very nice. Had a wonderful dinner in the Winter Garden, Breakfast every morning in The Northall & a few nights in Velvet, where I developed a taste for a Spicy Fifty (should have gotten the recipe). There were a few surprising glitches when the weekend approached. Had to ring a number of times for turndown service on Saturday night. Also, on the weekend, Northall service went from smooth & very professional to a bit frantic & lacking. Seems it was very busy & perhaps understaffed. However, overall it was 5 stars."
2074,Corinthia London,"I have no words to describe this hotel. From the first day my husband and I went there until we got married at the hotel Ballroom. Everything in the hotel is exquisite. The staff, the modern decor, the food. Our wedding it was just magical the events team is perfect! They will make everything in their power to guarantee a brilliant event. Their food menu is incredible. The canapes, the main coursec dessert. The service impeccable. I’d stayed 2 nights at one of their suites and OMG what a room. 80sq room. Beautiful living room with London Eye view. The bed is huge. A beautiful bathroom. I had the opportunity to enjoy the spa that has some nice lounge chairs to relax. I can’t think in a more magnificent place to stay and also to celebrate one of the most important days of my life.…"
2075,Corinthia London,"The BEST afternoon tea in London. Amazing food, great service in a beautiful ambiance. Would definitely come back again and highly recommend it. Sandwiches were delicious, freshly baked scones with the traditional strawberry jam and a delicious rhubarb jam, great touch. They even offer pastries and cakes to take home. Loved it !"
2076,Corinthia London,"Stayed at the Corinthia for a night as have had it on our Hotel Hit list for a long time. Location is amazing if you want to be close to Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace and Whitehall. Also, a stroll along the Themse is but a minutes walk away. The lobby and Cristal Moon space is breathtakingly grand ! What a statement and visual triumph as you enter the building. The check in counters are set to the right of the entrance call which is brilliant as the flow of foot traffic is directed very cleverly, avoiding congestion in a busy lobby! There are two entrances to the hotel as it’s built on a triangular plot which is intriguing and practical as it allows for a good flow through the ground floor. The flower arrangements in the grand hall are gorgeous, whimsical and tasteful,…"
2077,Corinthia London,Stayed at the hotel for a few days on business. Staff are very good as you expect. Gym is great. Room was very hot - A/C didn’t work. Also had problems with ‘do not disturb’ issues with staff entering the room. Overall for a 5 star property charging very high rates stay was poor. There are other hotels offering better value for money in the same area of London. I wouldn’t rush back.
2078,Corinthia London,"I’ve stayed at the Corinthia several times in the past & never had any problems but my stay this time has been very disappointing. Last night there was a spider crawling on my bed & I was so shocked at this!! I asked for a room change. The manager on duty said the hotel was booked & they didn’t have any rooms; so housekeeping came to change the sheets. The following morning, Angela was kind enough to move us to another room, BUT Now this new room is very warm and the AC is not working. And the AC is making a very loud noise. They said the engineer fixed something on the roof of the building & that this would cool down the room, but the room is still very warm and the AC is making a very loud noise. This is going to be the second night I’m going to have terrible sleep in the…"
2079,Corinthia London,"We traveled with a group for several theater performances for a week and the hotel was just fantastic!! The staff from the doorman meeting us on the street (due to road closures) to the check in staff, breakfast staff, housekeeping and even checkout staff were completely wonderful! Any request was filled within minutes. Always with a smile! I can’t say enough about them! The room was spectacular as well. We truly enjoyed the heated bathroom floor. I can say we never experienced anything like that! The room and features were as advertised. About the only thing I would like to see changed is the pillows. They were small, not much to them, but it did not take away from any sleep! I would highly recommend this hotel!!!"
2080,Corinthia London,"This hotel is fancy fancy and oh-so fabulous. Everything is lovely and extremely high end to match the price. The rooms are enormous and the beds are the best I've ever stayed in. My only (small) issue with the rooms are there are no outlets by the bed. My one outlet was way behind the side table and you could not fit an adaptor. And the room had 1 USB port. But other than that, I loved the rooms. Bathroom floors are heated and so are the towels/robes which give it a nice touch. The staff go out of their way to help you. I had breakfast at the hotel which was nice, albeit portions are small. The common areas are dripping with flowers and decor that brings the extra luxury feel."
2081,Corinthia London,"My husband booked afternoon tea for my birthday. It was a really lovely experience from start to finish. The location is lovely with the magnificent chandelier above. The staff are very welcoming and efficient. It is a lovely balance of luxury but without being pretentious. Some comparable hotels offer this but you feel you are “number 54” that day. Here it is much more of a personal experience. The food and drinks were all delicious and in abundance. They couldn’t have been more accommodating. At the time of booking I requested provision for 1 vegetarian, no white bread and no egg sandwiches - a big ask / test. Not only did they phone a couple of days before to discuss dietary requirements but they absolutely delivered on the day. This is frankly pretty exceptional attention to…"
2082,Corinthia London,"The hotel made me feel very welcome from beginning to end, very kind and attentive. It really was an experience being there, left me feeling very satisfied and well looked after and happy. The spa is an amazing feature to have, especially after a business event."
2083,Corinthia London,"The most amazing birthday treat from my husband for my 40th birthday. What a hotel. The location, the facilities but most importantly the staff we all amazing. From the moment we stepped into the hotel we could not have asked for any more. The staff were warm, welcoming and helpful. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the facilities in the room were amazing. Everything had been thought about. I have never known a hotel room in London be so quiet. The underfloor heating int he bathroom was delightful We dined one evening in Kerridge's which was delicious. The breakfast choice was phenomenal and amazingly tasty. The spa was an oasis of calm. I would love to come back, but its a luxury for very special occasions so will have to wait a while before we return"
2084,Corinthia London,"I visited the hotel for afternoon tea last weekend. Initially things started well, we had a lovely host at the restaurant and the food served was nice. What made the experience disappointing was being sat in what felt like a corridor, people constantly walking past and some even stopping by my seat to have conversations was very distracting and ruined the experience. During the last sitting the host departs earlier, no one came by to see if we needed any additional tea or another drink. It all just felt very lazy and that customer experience was secondary. I’ve visited many 5 star restaurants and the experience here falls short of what I would I expect and what I have previously experienced."
2085,Corinthia London,First visit and hopefully not the last. It’s motivated me to do more work to save up for another trip! Lovely warm staff who collect your luggage on arrival and departure. Superb food - breakfast and bar drinks - up to the perfect standard you expect for a 5 star hotel. Visited Velvet bar and the Northall. Room service perfect and no issues at all. Walking in corridor to room was lovely and smells amazing. Warm staff who make you feel valued. Felt rested at the end of the trip. Stayed at another 5* hotel several times in London this year and overall this feels the most comfortable/value for money. Overall worth it and only 3 mins walk to the tube station so happy days.
2086,Corinthia London,Charming and elegant with a service quality top. The Spa is a treasure in the centre of London with its fantastic marbles on the wall. Ideally located corinthia is a best in class hotel expressing warmth and professionalism.
2087,Corinthia London,"A rare experience can be ever experienced with a special girl such as the therapist Ana K in 90 minutes running treatment, after that treatment literally I felt 10 years younger. This is a recommendation which shouldn’t be missed by any chance . Her attention to details are precise in making you to relax to a point where you ask yourself when this time goes so quickly and obviously her gentle hands plays a major part in not just realizing her presence but almost a silent moment in recalling your inner energy from within a climb to heightened your level in advance .Naturally I present this application as part of expressing my gratitude towards her smooth response …"
2088,Corinthia London,"We wanted to visit this hotel when we fell in love with Thomas Kochs on the TV series. Wow it was worth it. Booked in for afternoon tea and had those fabulous striped China crockery. But let's get down to the food. Scoffed the sarnies before we remembered to take a photo. Absolutely amazing. What is even more amazing is the amount of sarnies you can have is limitless. Cucumber and pickle, coronation chicken, egg, smoked salmon and ham all served on exquisite breads. Warm scones on a box follow and then you are presented with a dessert tray where you don't get to choose one cake, but get all six! What you can't eat you take away with you in cute corinthia boxes. This was all washed down with limitless tea and a fabulous flute of champagne. Thomas we love you! Only…"
2089,Corinthia London,"I was fortunate enough to stay with Corinthia’s recently. Thank you Tore for the personalised arrival and departure experience. The room was spacious, nearly facing the Thames and all the amenities fantastic. We spent couple of hours in the Spa which was a very relaxing experience. After spending the day out, returning to The Corinthia is like returning to a lovely home. That is the definition of true luxury. I look forward to a chance to stay longer and enjoy the property more! Yes, the staff anticipate every need. A truly royal experience!"
2090,Corinthia London,"All I can say is such a beautiful experience here at this hotel. From private dining in the Northall room - which was amazing from the food to the service, could not fault. I had the buffet breakfast option the following morning and I loved the option of healthy breakfasts such as granola, juices and fresh fruits."
2091,Corinthia London,"OK. So many of us have been all over the world and stayed in hotels of all types, from 3 -6 stars. What I have found is that the real test of a great hotel is when things go wrong. With that, here is my review of NYE at the Corinthia: The hotel is wonderful. As good as the best in London. Beautiful and quiet Garden Suite, fanastic food and drinks, and staff as good you get. So what went wrong? My wife got COVID (probably from the plane trip over) and I got the flu. Everyone at the hotel was so helpful. At a difficult time for us, we felt like our family was there to help. Thank you Corinthia, especially the wonderul concierge desk, and Daniele Quattromini, Director of Food and Beverage. A+ Amanda and Glenn"
2092,Corinthia London,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The hotel is of course stunning and the Suite had everything we could want and more. I was in London for my book launch and the hotel suprised me with champagne and a cake to say congratulations! The customer service was amazing from start to finish. Honestly i couldnt think of anything that was negative and i stay in hotels on a weekly basis. Perfection
2093,Corinthia London,"I had a surprise birthday treat at the Winter Garden Corinthian Hotel yesterday afternoon. Our table was booked for 3.30pm. We had such a wonderful time and we were made to feel very special by Sebastian and his team. We had the lovely specially commissioned rugs for our knees and the heaters were great. The food and service were excellent and I highly recommend this for a special, memorable occasion. The only slight issue we had was the table next to us were conducting a loud business meeting !! After our starter course we asked to be moved to another table, which the team did very quickly and efficiently. Thank you Sebastian you and your team were outstanding and made us feel a part of your family. We will definitely return."
2094,Corinthia London,Amazing again! This is my absolute favourite hotel. Everything about it is fabulous! We stayed just before Christmas and the deco was beautiful and very festive. We ate dinner in Kerridges which was lovely. We had breakfast in the Northall which was great and we had drinks in the new Velvet bar. There was live music playing and the cocktails were lovely. The bar wasn’t open last time we stayed…..it has been decorated to a high standard. The staff were great as always. We arrived early and our room was ready for us. We will definitely be back. It is an expensive hotel but it’s worth saving up and treating yourself.
2095,Corinthia London,"Another fantastic visit to this awesome hotel. From the moment you step foot on the steps outside, you are made to feel welcome and it’s almost a requirement that you leave reality behind you, when you walk through their doors. The hotel is as splendid as always, with super friendly and helpful staff. Check in is quick and easy, you’re shown to your room and then left to your own devices. As you’d expect, the hotel is spotless, the rooms are a good size and once that door closes, so so quiet. We were meeting friends away from the hotel so we didn’t eat there this time, but we had drinks in the Velvet bar when we got back, with live music, ambience and a huge range of drinks. Again, everyone here was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was spot on and then we had a spa day…"
2096,Corinthia London,PLUS POINTS - hight quality furnished rooms youd expect from a 5star hotel - staff are polite and well trained again as youd expect - great that Tom Kerridge is attached with easy access - great location for river bank NEG POINTS - dire breakfast - poorly cooked GREASY English breakfast and lucky it was included otherwise i would have refused to pay - breakfast buffet split across 3 rooms one of which is the kitchen service area full of staff! Weird! - kids pool hours limited to 1 hour with limited space. Us adults can use it anytime so should be a min 2 hour slot I say - jacuzzi was only 30 or so degrees so basically a bubbly pool - drinks extremely expensive - rooms over priced for a family stay based on the above
2097,Corinthia London,This is without doubt the best hotel in London. Every single staff member is lovely they can't do enough for you. 6th time I've been back with my daughter for a lovely relaxing night and spa. The flowers and decor is amazing - now it's Christmas and fabulous
2098,Corinthia London,"Dear, I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent experience at your hotel. I had booked a massage treatment for my husband's birthday and was looking forward to a relaxing and rejuvenating experience. However, upon check-in, the process took far too long, which caused us to arrive late at the spa. Unfortunately, the staff at the spa were not flexible at all and instead of a 90-minute treatment as we had booked, they shortened it to 60 minutes. This left us feeling rushed and frustrated. Additionally, there was no personal conversation or attentiveness from the staff. In fact, after the treatment, we were simply handed a glass of water and left to find our way out. This was not the experience we were expecting or hoping for, and it certainly did not live up to…"
2099,Corinthia London,Having watched the tv programme showing how the hotel had been dressed for the festive period we wanted to experience it first hand. We weren’t disappointed. It was exquisitely decorated and the staff were charming. Although technically outside we were kept plenty warm enough with the heating and sheepskin backing to the seats. It was good to see a menu that didn’t overwhelm you with choices and all our courses were beautifully presented and tasted divine. The pace was perfect and our waiter( seems the wrong word when he was so much more!) was attentive and good humoured. It was the perfect way for us to end a long weekend in London. A suggestion though. With metal legged chairs on tiled floors any movement meant noisy screeching so rubber stoppers on the ends might help.
2100,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,We enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Churchhill. The rooms were well decorated and appointed and the staff were friendly with a good service orientation. The amenities on site met our needs and we could walk to many restaurants and sites from the property
2101,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are super duper clean. Beds were really comfortable. The location to the subway and nearby dining could not have been any better. I would love, love to stay here again in the future."
2102,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt Regency Churchill. Gorgeous hotel, fantastic staff, top notch service and beautiful rooms. From the moment you arrive, it's obvious the hotel staff care very much about the guest experience."
2103,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights, using points. The folks at the check in desk were friendly and allowed an early check in. Our room, 252, was nice, but quite small. The bathroom is tiny and can be likened to those on cruise ships. It was very difficult to use the bathtub and I can’t imagine a larger person using the restroom with ease. The bathroom is suitable for one person, but difficult if 2 or more are staying in the room. The bed is very comfortable. We asked for housekeeping service and it was provided. Extra towels were dropped off as well. The Churchill Bar is nice but extremely expensive. Two espresso martinis cost $51 USD. A rip off. Avoid if you can. The hotel is in a nice area. Check out Oxford Street just a couple of blocks away. Use the Underground.…"
2104,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"This hotel definitely lives up to its reputation. One of the most elegant and classy hotels of London. 1) Best location: Private garden, nearby coffee shops and restaurants, direct access to Oxford Street. 2) Amazing guest treatment: Staff are incredibly well mannered and friendly, and concierge are very attentive and helpful to guests. 3) Rooms: Clean, comfy beds (the comfiest bed and pillows i've tried in a hotel and i've tried many). The regular rooms are a bit cramped so i decided on a suite which was TERRIFIC. A living room and bedroom with a beautiful balcony overlooking the garden. 4) Breakfast: Delicious breakfast and staff are very responsive and friendly. I had access to the private lounge which had a separate breakfast and I loved the quiet environment of the…"
2105,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Great stay at the Hyatt Regency - The Churchill. Beautiful hotel with great amenities and nice comfortable rooms. The staff was very attentive in the lobby, restaurant and bar. The location is wonderful as well. I would certainly stay here again the next time we return to London for a visit!"
2106,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"The hotel itself is fine, and located in a good location. However check-in service was a mess. I arrived early, so my room was not ready (fine, not a problem). I was promised a phone call once my room was ready. The attendant offered to store my bags for me until I got my keys. After 3 hours, and no phone call, I went back to the hotel, and my room was ready, however that was never communicated to me. And when I asked for my bags, a) the front desk attendant let me know the bags were already in my room. After I entered my room, my bags were not there. So I had to go back down to the front and let them know my bags are not in my room, as they had indicated. then after 5-10 minutes of them searching, the attendant said she could not locate my bags, and asked that I come to the…"
2107,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"The Churchill's rooms, location, customer service, and food were outstanding. The rooms were clean, spacious, and had large windows, and we used a connecting door that enhanced our experience. Would stay again!"
2108,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"This used to be my favorite and go to London hotel. Customer service, helpful staff, location and customer focus excelled. It was a 5 star experience. Today, hotel is somewhat tired, impersonal, very pricey, and just average. They have really lost their mojo. I know because I have stated here over 200 nights over the past 10 years. But the location is great!"
2109,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"I highly recommend the Hyatt - Churchill, this was my second visit to the hotel and it was fabulous. The English breakfast and lounges were great. The location across from Hyde Park is perfect and we could walk everywhere. The staff is very professional and attentive."
2110,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Landed on an early flight, hotel was fully booked so I could not do an early check-in. Hotel staff was very nice to offer me the lounge access, when I requested for somewhere to freshen up. The location is very convenient and the breakfast buffet is decent too."
2111,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"I was surprised with the attitude of the stuff in the hotel as you are dealing with someone who is not interested, neither willing to cooperate in any dimension, this is the first and the last time I will use such a facility and on top of that it is extremely expensive hotel, and this is for watt?"
2112,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Very welcoming staff. Great location near marble arch and oxford street. Nice rooms. Clean and spacious. Somewhat outdated. Minibar was empty and there was a little shop where you could buy some drinks and snacks. That was not 5 star! Breakfast was very good with a good selection, and you can order eggs etc to your taste. Overall very nice hotell, but lacking the full 5 star experience."
2113,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"From the front desk staff, to the concierge, to the food and drink servers, this was a top-notch experience! Alexia at the front desk and Hank the concierge really took time to help us, Boris at the Churchill cigar and cocktail bar, and the staff at the breakfast buffet were all so helpful and knowledgeable. We were also pleasantly surprised at how soundproof the windows were for our rooms facing Portman Square."
2114,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Nice room and location, but the there is no lobby, I wasn’t expecting a 5 star hotel with no lobby. And my room was next the exit door so I was so annoyed by the noise employees do while I’m sleeping."
2115,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"High standard luxury hotel. Well-kept rooms and the atmosphere is like sleeping at home. The team is very kind and welcomes you with a smile from the moment you enter the hotel to the moment you leave it. Excellent breakfast, amazing stay."
2116,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,Excellent housekeeping . Food varieties are to be improved to include Middle Eastern stuff at lounge & to improve heigine part (insects/flies are at lounge many times ! Concierge team to be improved to ensure tags are given when luggage are taken .
2117,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"professional teams from guest personalisation, concierge, porter service, room service, and house keeping..who care every details of a guest's needs, especially when my luggage was delayed this time. thank you"
2118,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Truly enjoyed our visit to the Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill. Property is very nice, and location can not be beat. Close to Marble Arch/Hyde Park, Shopping, and tube stations. Breakfast was quite good, and the Bar & Terrace was a lot of fun."
2119,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Excellent service and amenities. We especially enjoyed the cocktails and snacks at the Churchill Bar and restaurant. The gym needs improvement in terms of size and equipment. In all other respects, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and are planning to come back in October"
2120,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"We booked 3 rooms, all of them were very hot. We contacted the hotel multiple time to fix the air conditioner but it remained the same, the solution was to bring a ""FAN"", which was very loud and noisy. Couldn't even sleep properly for the whole week."
2121,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"The rooms were very underwhelming, not what I expected for 400$ a night. The concierge staff was sometimes really nice, other times they were pretty indifferent. Breakfast was rather chaotic, with pretty slow service. Kudos for the doormen, which were always helpful and courteous. The location was very convenient."
2122,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,A wonderful hotel and located close to transit and shopping. Wonderful staff. A really quiet hotel. We were able to sleep in until 1030 without hearing any noisr The showers compared to American hotels is wonderful. The beds are great. The concierge lounge is a bargain with the food and staff great..
2123,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Excellent location, easy to reach from the airports. Nice rooms with modern fittings. An excellent breakfast! Cleanliness was well maintained, and the staff was helpful. The meeting room was disturbance free."
2124,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Second time at this hotel and it's always a good choice. Located within a 5 minute walk to all the Oxford St. shopping, the hotel is still quietly tucked away closer to residences. The thing I loved most about this hotel are the Japanese toilets which are all automatic. Room was great but the pillows could be better. If you like big fluffy pillows maybe you can request. The breakfast was extensive but ordering coffee almost always took forever. Plus it was blah, so don't bother."
2125,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,Truly amazing visit for my family of 4. The connecting Family room was perfect. Staff was super friendly + professional. Food at Churchills was great. The Buffett at breakfast was best we’ve ever had.
2126,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"You will not be disappointed with the level of service at this property. The staff goes above and beyond to meet your every need, my only regret is that I didn’t stay longer. 5 stars!!! From the doorman, to the bell hop and concierge I felt as though no small touch was missed. I was treated like royalty during my stay. The staff at breakfast was Excellent and the food was superb"
2127,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"It's been a couple of years since we last visited this hotel. Our room was decent enough but we forgot how small the bathrooms were (albeit well equipped). We found the standards of service out of sync with the high prices. As an example, a bowl of soup was £13 and when we asked for some bread - which really should be complimentary with soup - we were charged a further £7. Breakfast was pretty poor too, with just a very limited buffet and cooked-to-order eggs as an option. We also didn't like that a 13.5% daily discretionary service charge was added to our bill at check-out without checking with us first. It's mentioned somewhere in their booking terms but they really should ask at checkout before simply just adding it to your total. All things considered, it was not the…"
2128,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"I used to stay here lots years ago in the early 2000’s. It was my ‘go-to’ hotel in London. Oh how times have changed and work-wise my visits to London are much fewer and stay-overs much less. So, the opportunity to do a Friday night with my wife seemed a great idea. We wanted to go to Locanda Locatelli so why not stay at the Churchill - price seemed decent on a London scale? Check-in was fine but no help with bags. Room was ok if basic with comfy bed but small bathroom. Weird thing - vacant sockets by bed are European as UK sockets occupied by phone on one side and clock on the other so phone charging has to be at the desk. Tea/coffee facilities very ‘B&B’ - basic. No coffee machine. I had breakfast and it was a bit of a ‘zoo’ (kids running round) with buffet presentation…"
2129,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Do not hesitate to choose this hotel when staying in London. Convenient location, excellent amenities, and simply elegant. The hotel staff are eager to help and very friendly. We will certainly book here again next time we are in London!"
2130,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Above all, a lovely staff, who helped us with everything we needed and much more, professionally and warmly. Exclusive hotel, in an excellent and central location, large rooms. One of the places where I enjoyed the hospitality the most."
2131,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,We had a horrible experience at a neighboring hotel so we switched to The Churchill. From the moment we walked in we felt like we were on vacation and where we were supposed to be. Paulina at the front desk was awesome! The doorman were friendly and helpful in getting us cabs. The staff as a whole were fantastic.
2132,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"The room was very comfortable with a fantastic bed and tv and mini fridge. The breakfast buffet and staff was of the highest quality/engagement. The only single aspect that I would highly encourage the hotel ownership to consider would be changing out the tall/narrow bathtubs, even with the wonderful overhead rainfall shower, to a shower staff. For anyone but especially for folks approaching 60 or beyond it really isn't worth the risk and concern about getting in and out of a tub anymore even with ample handles.....and with periods of drought and energy costs taking a bath is just not the best option going forward. A spa experience is much more appropriate for that. But other than that the experience was fantastic."
2133,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,Elegance personified. Magnificent surroundings with all you expect and more. Senior staff could not be more helpful. Would definitely consider returning if for nothing more than the spectacular Saturday tea.
2134,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Its location is outstanding, room of decent size, very welcoming staff. Staff at the front door and reception were outstanding and hotel layout was decent. Breakfast was comprehensive and good quality. Highly recommended"
2135,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Good business hotel in a perfect Marylebone location. Rooms are modern, relatively spacious with super comfortable beds and modern upgraded showers. The breakfast is excellent, lots of traditional as well as healthy options, even coffee was good. Concierge and bellboys are super helpful. The hotel is Churchill themed, there are some artifacts and art pieces. The hotel has a well known cigar bar downstairs. The location is very central, walking distance to many attractions, shopping and sightseeing, there is also a taxi stand just outside and tube station 3 min away. Could not give 5 stars only because we had to wait for the rooms after our check in time, and check in was a bit slow, otherwise very good hotel and stay."
2136,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"One of my favorite hotels to stay overnight when I pass by the kids. Amazing service, comfortable parking and overall very stylish atmosphere. The breakfasts are outstanding! you don't feel hungry till the evening :)"
2137,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,The expected standards received on previous occasions was maintained and all staff very professional and helpful. I would always recommend it as a place to stay in London. Unfortunately my partner and I had to leave earlier than expected due to a family crisis. The Concierge was able to get me a flight to Canada in time for me to see my sister before she passed.
2138,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Lovely balcony suite overlooking the park. Club was great. Service was perfect. Shower drain was the only negative, but it was slow, not broken. Best mattress ever. Every detail considered by management. Can’t wait to come back."
2139,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,Our three nights were amazing! The location is superb to many areas of interest in London! Restaurants were delicious. Servers were attentive. Our room was perfect! Wouldn’t stay anywhere else in London!
2140,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,The Hotel is well mainained and at a great location. Its just a few steps from amenities and the tube station. Rooms are big and comfortable. Breakfast is good. There is also a club lounge. Recommended.
2141,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"I have arrived to the hotel me and my family at 12:30 pm we have been told that the rooms are not yet ready but it will be ready in an hour our less. Whoever, we went back to the hotel around 2:15 pm and they said the room was not yet ready so that made me very nervous I have told them that my kids are really tired and they need to get some rest but the staff are not helpful nor friendly at all and they put me on the waiting till 2:50 pm. I had my rooms but not as it spouses to be, the rooms wasn’t prepared to accommodate me and my family there was missing the extra bed as it was very clear in my reservation. Now it’s 4:00 pm and I’m still waiting for the extra bed. For sure I will never recommend this hotel to anybody traveling with their children. Also, I think that not only…"
2142,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Stayed here for one night as part of a birthday celebration. Had a room overlooking the square which was very pleasant. Sound insulation superb, so no issue with road noise. Room and bed extremely comfortable and all internal finishes are to a very high standard as would be expected for a hotel in this price bracket. Service was efficient, although perhaps lacking slightly in the personal touch."
2143,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,The Hotel is well located with view on a park Excellent breakfast with very good personnel Cleaned rooms We enjoy the neighbourhood and the calm of the rooms lot of restaurants and shopping very close
2144,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Excellent central London hotel in a perfect location for Oxford Street, Mayfair, Marble Arch etc. Reasonably sized room for central London with nice bathroom and comfortable bed. Staff attentive, helpful and add the thr experience. Lots of choice at this end of the market but this well worth a look."
2145,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"This was my 28th stay at the Churchill. Feels like coming home as the staff always greet me and welcome me back with so much warmth. The location of the hotel, the beautiful rooms and the ambience make it my favorite hotel and go to hotel in London. I shall be back. Love the Churchill."
2146,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Stayed here one night for first time with wife and 14 yo daughter - was impressed by overall service and standard of accommodation. Booked a suite and was delighted with the space, looked fairly recently refurbished, and high-end bedding/decor overall. Wooden floors, muted tones, lovely bookshelf display wall in room and great amenities overall. Bathroom was large, walk-in shower (but no rain shower head which is pretty much standard in high end hotels now) and lots of molton brown toiletries. Was a huge space on one side with a counter but needed a mirror for wife/daughter to do their make up - something that could easily be fixed as wasn't really anywhere else could do this (and is a bug-bear for my family). Lounge was ok - we were out for early dinner but didn't get a chance…"
2147,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"Once a great hotel turned into a place not to go near. Location is the only good thing about this hotel. Short staffed, I was checked into an already occupied room, had to wait almost 2 hours to be given another room. Rooms need major upgradation. Breakfast was just normal. Lifts were partially working so long wait there too. Not happy and would avoid going there again."
2148,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"We should have posted this review a while ago so please excuse us but we have been caught in an hurricane of bad sad events and happy ones. After a long planning and researches we couldn’t choose better place than London Hyatt Churchill. 2022 has been between planning between Italy and UK but for good & bad reasons we had to keep going in London. Luckly we have met the most wonderful and helpful team to listen and to prepare at the best details our day of joy surrounded by family and friends. Initially we had started our journey with Victoria, then Gigi and finally we met the lovely Aureline who carefully listened us for our desire and preparation details. Together we tailored an offer with a lot of precise details that go from setup, menu, timings etc This has been a quite…"
2149,Hyatt Regency London - The Churchill,"This stay was for four nights with my wife and 12 year old daughter. I used points for the stay along with an suite upgrade from the Hyatt loyalty program. We were assigned a Regency Suite with Balcony. I used the app to check in when we landed at Heathrow around 8:00 in the morning. About a half hour later I received an alert letting me know the room was ready for check in when we arrived at the hotel; that's awesome! Check in was efficient. They explained that we would have access to the Regency Club lounge on the 8th floor along with free breakfast each day in the restaurant. I requested a rollaway for my daughter upon check in as well. The room was clean, recently updated and had enough room for all of us. The club lounge was nice and we used it multiple times each…"
2150,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Just wow! What a fantastic hotel & the staff are superb..I haven’t experienced this level of customer service in a long time & me & my friend were blown away how they went above & beyond for everybody. The hotel is beautiful- excellent location & rooms were great with free soft drinks in mini bar, beautiful bathroom.everything was just wonderful. Thank you for being absolutely wonderful. I will always recommend this hotel."
2151,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Really good hotel. Excellent climate control in room, excellent bed and amazing shower. The location was also great with a short walk to the Abbey / surrounding bars / restaurants. Great weather always helps but the seating outside with a cold beer was great."
2152,Hotel Indigo Bath,"This is one of the best places I have said in the world. Everything is just perfect. The staff are friendly polite and helpful. The decor is brilliant and charming and it is in an incredible location. Right by the main shopping area, and a 5-minute walk to the train station, yet it is so peaceful. We really felt like we were looked after and really well rested."
2153,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Beautiful decor throughout, fabulous clean rooms (we were in the garden section and it was really lovely) and wonderful staff. With a perfect location in central Bath I really cannot recommend highly enough, we will be back!"
2154,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Had a wonderful weekend in Bath and really enjoyed Hotel Indigo. It was really easy to find, just a short distance from the main road into the city. The front desk team were brilliant, quick, friendly and helpful. Our room was fab, modern, quirky and extremely comfortable. It is 5 mins from the centre of Bath, with lots of bars and restaurants (and shops) close by. Breakfast was amazing. Our only issue is that we paid £40 for valet parking to find our car scratched on return, my best guess is a branch of the tree at the access point to the car park they use. These things happen but disappointing it’s been ignored. Great hotel, we will use again…. but next time on the train!"
2155,Hotel Indigo Bath,"We stayed for three nights in May and loved it. The decor is unusual and quirky and all the staff were really friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean and we had everything we needed. Especially loved the bathroom. Breakfast was really good, great choice of continental and well cooked hot dishes. We had bar snacks one evening which were great and the cocktails were fantastic. We used the car park on Charlotte's Street because we've used it before and we knew that it has plenty of spaces and long term parking. You can pull up outside the hotel to drop off and pick up bags. If there was anything negative it was that the room was very warm even with the air conditioning on the lowest setting. That's just me though. We would highly recommend and will…"
2156,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Just had a wonderful stay IHG Bath. Really like the decor and ambience of this hotel. Our room was great, very clean and had everything we needed. Spacious bathroom. All staff were super friendly and helpful. Great location, hotel is just a short walk from The Abbey, Roman Baths etc. Fantastic service in the Elder Restaurant, we had a superb breakfast, one of the best I’ve had at a hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel!"
2157,Hotel Indigo Bath,Absolutely beautiful. Super location amazing service and we were upgraded as my partner is a diamond elite member . We wanted a room with a bath as he had had a long journey from work but hotel full but they did manage to give us a choice of 2 rooms the one with the bath in the vaulted part is what we chose but they did say it was noisy from the rd and gave us ear plugs . It was a bit but we were so drunk we slept like the dead ! Shower was fantastic and the toiletries were great . Breakfast was delish . I couldn’t find fault wish we could have stayed another night to enjoy the bath tub again . I don’t live v far away so I’m praying the boyfriend books it again . Thanks everyone that works there I will never forget it magic memories
2158,Hotel Indigo Bath,This was a very good hotel. It is a modern Boutique style establishment in an historic building in Bath. The location is excellent being both convenient to the train station and the center of the city. The rooms are lovely and clean. The beds are very comfortable. A very nice stay in Bath.
2159,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Previously stayed end of last year and was very disappointed. I left a 1* review on the IHG website which was never published. Last time we were “upgraded” to one of the vaulted rooms (which I wouldn’t have picked anyway given the decor) and had an awful nights sleep right by the busy road. The bath plug didn’t work properly and the shower flooded the bathroom and bedroom floor whenever turned on. The manager invited us to return recently with a discount to make amends. The second visit was much more enjoyable, this time we were in the main building rather than the vault annex. Design of room was to our taste. Welcome chocolates in room appreciated. Bathroom very good. Cooked breakfasts were decent. Like that the mini bar was complimentary. Old building has character. Soft…"
2160,Hotel Indigo Bath,"It was our wedding day and Hotel Indigo let us hire 3 rooms to get ready in before stepping out to St John’s Church opposite to get married!! From the moment we enquired, Aleksandra went above & beyond to make our experience enjoyable and accommodating for us and our guests who stayed overnight. She picked wonderful rooms and it was so lovely to see her on the day too! All the staff were attentive, friendly and the hotel is just beautiful. Great location."
2161,Hotel Indigo Bath,Tastefully done room with attention to detail. Lovely wall decorations and little nice touches like a nice tea tray with lovely cups for complimentary tea / coffee. The staff was super friendly too. A mere 3 mt walk from the railway station and easy access to restaurants and attractions. A gluten free restaurant 2 mts away with good choices. The hotel is a tad expensive but totally worth it!
2162,Hotel Indigo Bath,"As a ‘fussy’ New Yorker I’m pretty picky when choosing a hotel, SO glad I picked this place. The city was busy parking wise but parked up in a local parking lot opposite. Warmly greet at the front desk, a very happy lady who explained what we needed to know, which was welcomed from our long travel from Edinburgh. Nicolas (front desk manager) was very charming and had a good sense of humor and helped us navigate the city with good suggestions and he recommended some good eateries as their in house restaurant was closed (shame) on our visit. We had 2 courtyard rooms and they are very different to what I’ve stayed in before, I loved! Wonderfully clean and ‘quirky’ with air conditioning, our first U.K. hotel with it. Breakfast service was awesome too. Bath is such a special place.…"
2163,Hotel Indigo Bath,"The room was large and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful. You can order a cooked breakfast or partake of the self-serve continental breakfast, or both. This hotel is very centrally located in Bath, making it easy to walk anywhere you want to go. Be sure to look at the fun pictures on the walls!"
2164,Hotel Indigo Bath,"I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The room was comfy , the bathroom was big with both shower and bathtub . The room is a tad small but maybe it is perfect for people who are looking for weed getaways . It's centrally located ( amazing Thai restaurant across the road called Sala Thai ) and you can walk into the old town across the river or just turn the opposite directions and you will find all the nee stores. The service at this hotel is superb . I love the service at Breakfast although the choices are limited and they did out a huge dollop of Butter on my toast even after I'd told them that I was dairy intolerance but it was corrected the next day . The staffs are very nice and helpful. The staffs at the receptions were also very helpful and were very pleasant and…"
2165,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Stayed the Thursday night before the Easter weekend. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the station, ideal location for central Bath and literally a minute away from some fantastic restaurants and bars. The room wasn’t very big but it was comfortable and the TV was in an ideal place for getting cosy with a film. It’s also the first time I’ve had a TV on a bracket that you can move, which was great and meant no craning your neck to watch from bed. The room was clean with robes, mini bar, hair dryer, iron and ironing board. The bathroom was lovely, large shower with a rain head and smaller head. Our room was at the back of the property, no real view but it was quiet apart from the pigeons in the morning chattering. We had breakfast which was nice, not the widest selection but…"
2166,Hotel Indigo Bath,"I spent two weeknights at the Hotel Indigo Bath, receiving a minor upgrade for my Diamond Elite status. I can’t exactly tell what the upgrade was, but the hotel at least acknowledged my status. No amenity in the room, however. Tsk tsk. That aside, the hotel is a listed building with an authentic Victorian exterior and wacky and eclectic interior that looks like it is from an illustration of Alice through the Looking Glass. The interior of the hotel is well done and worth a look even if one isn’t staying! The room featured a small, crowded living area and giant bathroom with a large walk-in shower and decorative freestanding bathtub. I can’t help but think the space is wasted and could have been put to better use in the living quarters. I ate an evening meal and…"
2167,Hotel Indigo Bath,Had a lovely night at this hotel. Staff were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The hotel was beautiful and very well decorated. The room was really lovely and the bathroom spectacular! The bed was really comfortable and tea and coffee were available in the room. We were on the top floor and I was not disturbed by any street noise: the blackout shutters were really good too. We had a drink in the bar downstairs and that was good too. Perfect location for access to the train station and to the town: literally a couple of minutes walking from both. Fascinating hotel and highly recommended.
2168,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Could possibly be my favourite hotel! We actually booked another hotel… the little said about that the better, so last minute we switched to Hotel Indigo. After speaking with Nick on the phone, we were booked in arrived and again was welcomed by him. We booked a standard room but he was so kind and upgraded us to one of their outside garden rooms…we instantly knew we chose the right place. ((Thank you so much)) The room was very quirky, tropical theme, stylish with a great rainfall shower. It was a little cold initially but then realised the heating was not on, our fault! Nice products in the room and my favourite Nespresso pods! Had a great night sleep, bed really comfy. After dinner we chrome casted a film and had a little sleep in. On check out they let us store our…"
2169,Hotel Indigo Bath,"A very nice hotel with friendly staff. We were early for check-in, they looked after our bags and moved them to our rooms. It was in a central location, we could walk to lots of surrounding shops and restaurants. The Hotel had no parking, but there was a car park across the road, so it's convenient. Our room was nice with a comfy armchair and a writing desk. The bathroom was spacious with a good shower. There was a safe; slippers and bathrobes were also available. Everything in the mini fridge was complimentary, plus tea and coffee making facilities. The worst feature of the room was the tiny wardrobe, which barely had enough room for our winter coats. The buffet breakfast had excellent choices, plus cooked breakfast and hot drinks were served. All and all, we…"
2170,Hotel Indigo Bath,On arrival reception was very friendly and helpful. We arrived early around 12 but we were smoothly checked in. We stayed in room 121 which was lovely. The underfloor heating in the bathroom was a nice touch. The location was perfect. Easy for the train station and for the city centre. The decor was fun and the hotel had a great vibe. We’d definitely stay here on our next visit.
2171,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Had a couple of nights here to celebrate my birthday. Staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble for them. The whole hotel looks recently very nicely refurbished - very interesting paintings! Our room was very quiet, spacious and well equipped. There was a bit of discovery of how things worked as there were no instructions - e.g. we found a dial in the bathroom and it controlled the radio in the ceiling! That is the only negative comment I can make - no big deal at all. We had breakfast and lunch once in the Elder restaurant - very good and again service was professional but friendly as well. The hotel location is very good. As the tourist part of Bath is quite small, nothing seems to be more than 10 minutes walk away. Next time we need to spend a night…"
2172,Hotel Indigo Bath,"This hotel is a splendid riot of whimsical decoration, but manages to remain cool and collected when it comes to service. The staff could not have been more helpful at every turn. The secure car park is also a great advantage to staying in the heart of Bath. The breakfast is plentiful and delicious, again with impeccable service. We would definitely stay here again."
2173,Hotel Indigo Bath,"This is my third visit to the hotel and there is a very good reason that i will soon be booking my forth... From the moment I walked in, i was greeted with a warm smile and jovial conversation. I was offered an upgrade on my room (free of charge) and the concierge walked me to the room. Dinner was in the bar and once again the staff could not do enough to help me. I had a small complaint about the food, but this was rectified instantly and without any fuss. I always find that it is the way that you deal with issues that can be more important than the issue itself. The room was fantastic, with both bath and shower... i was tempted by both, however the bed won and i had another great nights sleep. I do not have breakfast (life of a rep) but the checkout was easy again and it felt…"
2174,Hotel Indigo Bath,Staff extremely friendly and helpful …hotel beautiful and excellent location …within walking distance of everything ….Hotel has restaurant which we had breakfast in and was very good…..I loved hotel decor ….very calming …staff very professional
2175,Hotel Indigo Bath,"This hotel was recommended to us by friends who stayed last year. My partner said the booking process was seamless and as soon as we arrived we were greeted by the most wonderful smell! Apparently it is a unique scent created for the hotel. We were warmly welcomed, we arrived around 12pm and to our surprise the room was ready so we were able to check in and leave our bags as we have appointment at the spa. The check in process was quick and we were shown to our room by Nick (a great ambassador for the hotel) who explained all that we needed to know and he arranged for a table at their restaurant, The Elders (separate review pending for there :) The room was gorgeous, we upgraded to a superior room and they upgraded us again to a vaulted bedroom, my gosh, it was great. They…"
2176,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Lovely hotel in a brilliant location. Seconds from the centre, easy walking distances. The hotels a bit of a maze as it’s within sections of the building however does have great main road access doors with were brilliant. Definitely would recommend to others, and would go back. Beautiful decoration and room design. Only downside would be the lack of parking. There is a car park opposite however it’s expensive and not included in the hotel costs."
2177,Hotel Indigo Bath,"What a place! I do not usually write reviews, however on this occasion I felt compelled to. This place is amazing. I have stayed in other Hotel Indigo's with work and have to say this is by far my favourite. From the moment my partner and I arrived we were warmly greeted by Tracy, who encouraged us to sign up to be members of their loyalty programme and we were informed in great detail via a map on what to see and do, as it was our first time in Bath. Christian (I believe that was his name) showed us to our room and explained all about the room, thanks (as it took us a moment to figure out the light switches! ) The room was SO pretty, full of character and modern touches and my biggest area, it was super clean. The shower was very hot and powerful and the beds, so…"
2178,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Hotel location is perfectly placed within the city. A lovely warm welcome from Tracy and Nic on reception on check in. We were then assisted to our room by Cristian who kindly carried our luggage. Tracy recommended several places to visit and discussed the neighbourhood story of the hotel giving us a map of the city of prime locations to visit. Room décor was quirky yet attractive with a large bathroom and roll top bath, absolutely beautiful. We were allocated an Architectural room which was spacious and clean with a very comfy bed and pillows. Lovely complimentary chocolates with a card for our anniversary. We enjoyed a nice cocktail in The Elder bar and again staff very friendly. Breakfast was lovely and presented well. Will be returning for another great experience at…"
2179,Hotel Indigo Bath,"I had booked this Hotel for a special Birthday gift for my Husband , as we love visiting Bath. We had never stopped here before. Checking in was smooth and easy reception staff were great. We were taken to our room which on first inspection we were happy with. Unfortunately have to agree with the previous review regarding cleanliness. The room sadly had a few MAJOR issues that never should have been missed. I reported this straight away, and after a very unpleasant encounter with a housekeeping member I asked to see the manager. Nick was very helpful,apologetic and professional. We were offered a room move and upgrade which we very much appreciated. All front of House staff were extremely helpful and professional. Tracey on reception was just one by name to mention. …"
2180,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Firstly I really like this hotel having stayed on a few occasions. The hotel is well appointed, the reception staff are fantastic, the rooms are nicely decorated and the breakfast is good. However, I was left disappointed this stay due to the standard of cleanliness in my room. Huge spiderweb in the bathroom and a very thick layer of dust on top of the wardrobe , along with a quite unpleasant smell in the room. Definitely not up to the high standard I have previously experienced."
2181,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Disabled access : We stayed here with our guide dog, in one of the accessible rooms. Excellent quality service, lovely room. Huge bed. Get lost in it bed :) about 100 meters from the hotel over flat ground with crossings, are about 20 disabled parking spaces, so don’t pay for the parking over the road. You can drop off and pick up easily from the hotel door. From our room there was a door that you could access the street from directly, which was really useful."
2182,Hotel Indigo Bath,"We just spent 3 nights here It was a wonderful experience. Staff were very accommodating, professional and friendly. Our room was perfect and the bed and pillows so comfortable. Breakfast was excellent. Restaurant was beautiful but we’re not fancy eaters. Went for dinner at The Hunt Club up the street and The Crystal Palace. Train station was a block away. Perfect 3 night stay."
2183,Hotel Indigo Bath,"We stayed here last week and had a fantastic time! I loved every art of the hotel - the staff were friendly and helpful, the bedrooms are ver clean and comfortable, the decor is so quirky and fun! I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Bath, as well as using the IHG/Hotel Indigo brand when I travel elsewhere. Thank you for a brilliant stay Hotel Indigo Bath."
2184,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Quite a mixed experience. We were warmly welcomed and most of the staff we encountered were really friendly. Our room was lovely. The bed was luxurious albeit very high off the floor, which some people might find difficult. The bathroom was nice, with a lovely rainfall shower. The hotel provide high quality “Bramley” toiletries, which adds to the luxurious experience. We had booked on a B&B basis, which adds £20 to the price. I love a full English breakfast, which I only eat when we’re staying at hotels. The breakfast at the Indigo was the most disappointing aspect of our stay. My scrambled eggs and my wife’s poached eggs were cold, as were the beans and tomato. To be fair, the sausages, bacon and black pudding were possibly the best quality I’ve enjoyed in a “chain”…"
2185,Hotel Indigo Bath,The hotel had two people eating breakfast. I hadn’t booked but they said they were too busy not great for an IHG hotel in a major tourist city in the UK! It’s time hotels like this and staff like this wake up to the fact that they are there to provide a service to the customer
2186,Hotel Indigo Bath,"I travel a lot for work - and had a bad experience the night previous in cardiff city centre. On arrival at this hotel I asked for a room with a bath - my feet were killing - and I was kindly upgraded by concierge. the room had a gorgeous free standing bath, huge bed, super clean, plenty of space, below ground level allowed total privacy and a quiet , restful atmosphere. I slept so well and really did feel rejuvenated - followed by a lovely breakfast in the restaurant (great dairy free options ) cant thank the team enough. I didn't want to leave. Thank you!"
2187,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Great hotel within 5 minutes of Bath Rugby club, restaurants, and central Bath. Lovely cheerful staff and very helpful. Our standard king room was smaller than most we have stayed in but the room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable. Plenty of plug and usb sockets and all the usual amenities. The bathroom/shower room was perfect. The only reason we didn’t give 5 stars was because the tea sachets and bottled water were not replenished and also after arriving back to our room quite late we found we were still left with wet towels. We hadn’t left the card on the pillow saying we didn’t need a towel change. I am certain that if we had rung reception these things would have been sorted, but after a long day, sleep was the priority. A nice touch was the china cups and…"
2188,Hotel Indigo Bath,"AMAZING!! Room was fantastic, we stayed in the family room, 2 double beds with a nice bathroom and a little snug type place. The mini fridge was complimentary and there was plenty of clothing storage. Staff were so helpful and friendly, as we were walking out of our room The man came to top up the mini fridge with drinks and he even asked us if we wanted extra. Our room was made to perfection every day! There is a gym onsite which is well stocked with equipment, weights, treadmills and so on. There is a breakfast buffet with great selection along with hot food too! Great location about a 5 minute walk to station, Abby and Roman baths. Overall 10/10 and would definitely recommend. AMAZING!!"
2189,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Fantastic stay for Valentine’s Day, IHG at its best, service from all the staff was amazing. Would highly recommend this hotel, will definitely return. The rooms are huge, clean and comfortable. Nothing to complain about at all. Thank you to all the staff!"
2190,Hotel Indigo Bath,"The staff were very welcoming and helpful upon arrival. The hotel was close to town and only a five minute walk from the train station. Our room was lovely, it was very clean and the theme of the room was very stylish and fun! However we did not have a very good night sleep due to the noise from up stairs and outside the window. The bed also felt quite small for a double bed. We still enjoyed our stay nevertheless."
2191,Hotel Indigo Bath,"The hotel is in an excellent location and we had no problems parking nearby. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the breakfast was delicious. However, I think the thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff. Without exception they were professional, friendly and incredibly helpful. Would definitely stay there again."
2192,Hotel Indigo Bath,"The staff were wonderful, the decor was beautiful and the breakfast was delicious. However, I paid for a King size Premium room, and upon arrival was told I was being ‘upgraded’ to a Superior only to find the room anything but. Whilst it was clean and decorated nicely, it was not the king size bed I had paid for and the room space was small in size. The room, a shipping container only smaller, was in the ‘Gardens’ with next to no natural light and was cold upon entering. We put the heating on which took 3+ hours to get from 13 degrees to 17 and would not go higher. The cold tiled floor however was freezing the entire stay and uncomfortable after a shower and whilst trying to change. There was very little sound proofing, and we were awoken at 6am by the sound of other customers…"
2193,Hotel Indigo Bath,"We recently stayed her for 2 nights and it was fabulous Location - close to every attraction shops and restaurants Parking - We paid for valet £30 p/n but there is a public car park across the road Staff - Every member of staff were polite, helpful and had a smile, particularly the lady on reception Room - We were on the 3rd floor, room was very well decorated and bed comfy. The bathroom had a massive roll top bath and separate shower. It was one of the nicest bedrooms I’ve ever stayed in! Breakfast - Hot and cold options, tasty and plentiful I would definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully return"
2194,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great location to explore the city. Hotel was beautiful - bar, restaurant and lounge areas. Room was decorated lovely, had everything we needed and comfy bed and good shower. Loved sitting and drinking in bar when we returned from an evening out. Really tasty breakfast. Excellent service from start to finish from every member of staff. Looking forward to return to Bath and definitely this hotel soon."
2195,Hotel Indigo Bath,My daughter & I stayed here for one night on Sunday the 5th of February. We arrived early & left our luggage with the receptionist . The hotel is quirky in appearance & looked very comfortable too. When we got back we checked in & were taken to our room where our luggage had been taken . We stayed in room 616 on the third floor . The room was cosy & very warm . There was everything you needed in the room & lovely Bramley bath products in the bathroom . The bathroom had both a normal shower & a rainfall shower . The bedroom & bathroom were very clean . We had breakfast the next day which had a good choice on the continental & a nice choice on the cooked menu . We were disappointed however with our choice of avocado with & marinated tomatoes on toast as it was cold & the eggs…
2196,Hotel Indigo Bath,Fabulous hotel...quirky interior design which I LOVED. Stayed in room 418 with massive bed and big wet room bathroom. Buffet breakfast was delicious and comfy lounge chairs for night time drinks. Ideally located for central bath and car park directly opposite. Would highly recommend.
2197,Hotel Indigo Bath,"The staff at this specific hotel was like none other. I have never experienced true kindness and hospitality as reception and valet has shown. Jeanie the valet spent 15 min of time showing us scenic roads and back country drives to Stonehenge instead of the boring highway. When we checked in, the staff made us dinner reservations at Joya, the best Italian steakhouse we have ever eaten at. We stayed at another hotel chain the first night and canceled all the other nights with other chains to book with Hotel Indigo!!! I would give 15/10 stars. The best and most comfortable beds and each Hotel Indigo has different decor depending on the city you are staying in."
2198,Hotel Indigo Bath,Lovely hotel perfectly sites within easy walking to everything. The staff was nice and the lobby area was beautifully designed. The hotel is actually many adjoined buildings connected with halls and elevators. Unbelievable that there are 150 rooms since it seems more intimate than a large hotel. We reserved a king room and our only disappointment was that the bed was not very comfortable and it was not a king. I attempted to ask the hotel desk about it our first morning since there had been a room change during check in but I was assure that it was a king.
2199,Hotel Indigo Bath,"Stayed here for two nights (Friday and Saturday). The hotel is in a convenient location for Bath city centre. A short walk from the train station and there was a car park just across the road. The hotel looks very smart from the outside, although the entrance could be slightly better signed. The reception area is fairly small and at busy times felt a bit jumbled and full. To reach our room we had to descend to the basement, walk across a courtyard and then ascend to the 3rd floor of another section of the building. We were glad that it wasn't raining! We had a room up in the eaves of the building. It was freshly decorated and had a slightly quirky feel to it, which was mostly attractive. The shower room was spacious, well decorated and very clean. The room could have…"
2200,The Resident Liverpool,Only stayed one night but was impressed by the high quality of the hotel and friendliness of the staff. The hotel was clean and quite and I got the best hotel sleep I’ve had for a while. The double bed was extremely comfortable. Would consider upgrading next visit.
2201,The Resident Liverpool,"The location is brilliant for central Liverpool, only 10min walk to the docks. However, we stayed in 308 and the room above had really squeaky floorboards and bed. The person staying in there didn't go to sleep until 3.30am so neither could we!!"
2202,The Resident Liverpool,"For the second year we have enjoyed Liverpool and our accomodation as stated previously we had no issues loved going sightseeing, the docks the museum's again the shops, dining and the beautiful weather made it even better."
2203,The Resident Liverpool,"Once again my husband and I spent a few days in this wonderful hotel 3-7th June and again we were not disappointed.The staff are so welcoming and very helpful the rooms are lovely and they have a little kitchen area with what you need a fridge microwave kettle coffee maker crockery and cutlery,they don't do meals on certain days from 6-7 they have complimentary drinks and nibbles which is nice.the building is a converted warehouse, plenty of bars restaurants not far away and the docks are lovely to see.we definitely recommend it and would not hesitate to return again.This year was a bonus as weather was lovely previously we went earlier in the year . Keep up the good work to all staff you are doing a great job thanks."
2204,The Resident Liverpool,"We stayed just for one night as we were meeting friends in the city. It was last minute so was surprised at how reasonable the price was compared to the rest of the Liverpool. The room was so comfortable and the pillows were amazing! One thing that was great was security of the building. You use the key to get in and to work the lift which made us feel safe being in such a busy area. I have family overseas who will visit later in the year and will be booking them into this hotel as it’s just perfect, thank you for a wonderful stay."
2205,The Resident Liverpool,"We’ve stayed at the resident a number of times and it’s pretty much our go to hotel in Liverpool and it’s always been a positive experience. This time we had a issue as we booked online for 3 of us with our 16 year old son with us and asked for a double and single bed. When we arrived we had been allocated a room with only a king size bed. Not a problem for Darius on reception though as he said when we went out for food he would arrange for a single to be put in the room, however half and hour later Darius rang our room and offered us a free upgrade to what was almost a studio flat on the fourth floor. A brilliant service! You can’t go wrong with this hotel, we’ve stayed in at least 7 or 8 different hotels in Liverpool as we have been going to the city for the best part of 15…"
2206,The Resident Liverpool,"From the booking to check out every area of service was delivered at an exceptional level of quality. A phone call to check the bed configuration to a personal card welcoming us to the room , the level of service at The Resident really does set the standard"
2207,The Resident Liverpool,"A great hotel. Good location,excellent, friendly , efficient staff,very comfortable beds and good facilities in the room. We were upgraded at check-in No noise at all from outside. Would definitely return and recommend ."
2208,The Resident Liverpool,Lovely hotel to stay if you need to be central in Liverpool. Close to shops and lovely restaurants. Air conditioning and double glazed so no problem sleeping. Have stayed about 5 times and wouldn’t go anywhere else.
2209,The Resident Liverpool,"3rd visit to The Resident and this was as good if not better than other stays. Apart from great staff, rooms and location - this time we took advantage of the hospitality hour with a complimentary beer or wine. Lovely touch. Also forgot how nice it was to have room serviced every day as standard and not by request. Marked down because of the lack of breakfast options (our previous favourite place had closed down) and the trek to the car park. Next time we’ll be sure to unload outside rather than struggle from nearby Q Park"
2210,The Resident Liverpool,"Will definitely go back as lovely hotel. Although it is expensive on a Fri and Sat so it will be through the week but that actually suits me better as not as busy. Lovely staff, clean room and bathroom."
2211,The Resident Liverpool,Perfect overnight stay in the heart of the entertainment district. Hotel is great and such good value. Everyone who works there seems happy and friendly. The free glass of wine in the evening was a nice touch.
2212,The Resident Liverpool,"We did not have ant enjoyable stay at this hotel. No tea / coffee making facilities or mini bar in the room, no restaurant on site, not even a vending machine. The area has quite a busy nightlife scene so it's very noisy and found it very difficult to sleep. The room cist us £146 fior one night so will definitely not be booking this hotel again."
2213,The Resident Liverpool,"Booked after some research reading reviews and I wasn’t disappointed! Old converted building with exposed brick added character and charm. Reception staff were very welcoming and friendly. A lovely touch was the card inviting us for welcome drinks on our first evening! Rooms small but perfectly adequate with a great mini kitchen behind the wardrobe and very comfy beds! Great location, close to shops, bars and restaurants. Definitely will return."
2214,The Resident Liverpool,"This is a fantastic hotel for value, quality, staff and location - mini fridge, good coffee, clean rooms, lovely staff and a great location with bars, dining and beautiful buildings close by. It is yards away from great places to eat and drink. Also close to the dock area"
2215,The Resident Liverpool,It’s a great location. Fantastic hotel. Really comfortable. The staff are knowledgable and friendly. Beds were really comfy - including pull outs. But we found the night noise from other venues in the street a bit of a pain closer to the weekend.
2216,The Resident Liverpool,"Great location near Bold Street. Good for eating, drinking and shopping. Stylish place and friendly staff. Will definitely go back. Midweek prices made it great value for money and walkable distance from train, city centre, docks and Molten Brown in the bathroom a nice touch."
2217,The Resident Liverpool,"Absolute top class hotel. The location is perfect to explore the city. On arrival at the hotel the staff greeting us with a happy professional manner. The room was spotless, comfortable and spacious. The Molton Brown toiletries in the room were lovely, the room was so well equipped with fridge, microwave, coffee machine, kettle, hairdryer and iron. Comfortable bed and sound proof rooms. Amazing! We received complementary drinks in the evening. Staff were very helpful and happy to help. I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely come back and stay again. Thank you so much :-)"
2218,The Resident Liverpool,"One of the loveliest hotels I've stayed in! First of all, the front desk staff - Christopher, Harry and Cole - were extremely welcoming and helpful. The desk is staffed 24 hours and they were available to answer any question I had. The room was lovely - full kitchen (dishes, refrigerator, microwave, teas, coffee) and the tub was deep (and clean) and perfect for a bath after walking around the city all day. Because of the triple paned windows, the room was SO quiet even though there is quite a lively neighborhood just out the door (worth exploring!) The location of the hotel was perfect for my needs - no more than a 10 or 15 minute walk to the waterfront, shopping, cathedrals - and lots of restaurants and pubs are only a few minutes away. And between 6 and 7 every evening,…"
2219,The Resident Liverpool,We stayed for two nights at £100 a nights we thought we'd pay a little extra as it was 4 star and because we were staying two nights. The first room was very small the bed was in a small inlet against 3 walls so we had to climb over each other to get out of it. I'm 60 with a lot of health problems also my husband is 6ft 4ins it was to small he could stretch out. The shower floor was all chipped the kitchen was in a cupboard it had a small sink the dishes were to big to put into it to wash inside the fridge was moulded on part of it. We asked to be move and were overed a upgrade for an extra £70. But couldn't get us another room till next day. We had a very uncomfortable night the bed was lumpy and uncomfortable husband hurt his feet hitting the wall throughout the night. We…
2220,The Resident Liverpool,The hotel was very clean and was in a great central location for nightlife and shopping. The hotel had a nice vibe and a modern hotel in a historic building. Staff were professional at all times with any advice requested. Would definetely stay again.
2221,The Resident Liverpool,Very close to centre of Liverpool so walked to docks and Philharmonic easily. Be warned that the noise of the nightclubs can be heard (muffled beat of music) but if you are tired the room is comfy and cosy so it may not be an issue. All staff were fantastic. We were able to leave our luggage easily enough on checkout day.
2222,The Resident Liverpool,"My overall impression about the hotel is that I can probably say that I was satisfied with it. I was staying in Liverpool during the entire Eurovision week. Because of Eurovision, hotel prices were obviously high all over town. For the 6 nights I paid approximately $1200 or $200 per night. I reserved a Standard King Double Room. Just being curious, I checked the rate for the same room the following month, and to my surprise, its regular price is only around $80 per night. And this type of room, which is mostly basic, is actually priced right at $80. But $200 per night is a lot of money for this room, so I am definitely not happy how much extra money I wasted. The good news is that when checking-in, I got a room following my requests, including a high floor and room with a big…"
2223,The Resident Liverpool,Me and my partner stopped in a king double Our room wasn’t ready as we arrived a little early But our cases were tagged and placed in a secure room for us to collect later or they would take to the room if we were a while We went back just after 3 to be told our room was ready and we’re given our cases a card and some truffles The room on floor 3 was exceptionally clean Carpets looked new and everything looked pristine The lady who checked us in (sorry can’t remember her name But she had curly hair) was very friendly and made us feel very welcome We asked about a taxi and they rang for one which arrived in a couple of minutes On the second day we went back to our room mid afternoon to find the cleaner in who was very friendly and asked if we would prefer for him to leave…
2224,The Resident Liverpool,"We (3women) loved this hotel. The location is perfect, close to Albert Dock, pubs and restaurants, shopping, museums. The hotel staff is great - friendly and helpful. There’s a complimentary wine “happy hour” at 6:00. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2225,The Resident Liverpool,"Extremely impressed by the Resident - clean, good-sized, well-equipped rooms, friendly staff, interesting building (my room had exposed beams going back to the 18th century). Location is right in the middle of Liverpool and the hotel is also excellent value."
2226,The Resident Liverpool,"Beautiful hotel in central Liverpool Spacious clean rooms Super friendly staff at the front desk Although there is no breakfast, you can find plenty of cafés and restaurants nearby Centrally located but yet rooms are quite"
2227,The Resident Liverpool,"Modern and central location, great value if staying off peak, and spotless too. Staff were welcoming and friendly. Some nice touches like the ice machines, artwork, and welcoming drinks. I'd stay again."
2228,The Resident Liverpool,"Absolutely fantastic hospitality. Harry and Christian on the front desk were so very helpful absolutely brilliant. The room was lovely, clean and comfortable. Highly recommended and thank you gentlemen for your warm welcome and help!."
2229,The Resident Liverpool,"Nice modern apartments and good service. Comfy beds. Central location. Good sound insulation. No breakfast, but lots of cafes near by. Good ventilation in the room (just remember to turn it on). A lot of bars quite close by, not a problem for us but it gets more busy at night and might not be as nice for families with younger children. The room was quite small. Can always be cheaper, hotel rates are going crazy."
2230,The Resident Liverpool,"We were very happy with the rooms: specious, clean,comfortable bed, nice inviting shower, large tv. The stuff was very helpful & accommodating helping us with all we needed . Hotel is Conveniently located, easy walk anywhere. Would definitely recommend it."
2231,The Resident Liverpool,"Love staying at The Resident whenever I'm in Liverpool. You're guaranteed a warm Scouse welcome from one of the friendly reception team. The rooms are clean, quiet, stylish and great value for money. Excellent central location. Eat out at the Queens Wine Bar (decent wine bar fare and recommended by the no-nonsense restaurant critic Jay Rayner). Breakfast at Baltic Bakehouse (a stone's throw from Tate Liverpool)."
2232,The Resident Liverpool,Conveniently situated just a stone's throw from the city shopping and nightlife this hotel has all you could want for a stay in the city. Don't offer meals but so many different cuisines close by. Excellent.
2233,The Resident Liverpool,"Perfect location, close to everything such as shops, bars, clubs, eating out and sight seeing but in a quiet location too. Great value for money. Very friendly staff and hotel/rooms are clean. Would definitely recommend to stay and hopefully return in the near future."
2234,The Resident Liverpool,"I loved everything about this hotel. I received a warm welcome at check-in and went upstairs to find a clean, comfortable room. Every area of the hotel, from the reception to the corridors looks attractive and the rooms are no different. The kitchen amenities are a nice touch, and tucked away so as not to feel intrusive. Plenty of wardrobe space, a nice bathroom and easy to control temperature. These are the things that are important to me! Nice touches like the greetings card on arrival, and a glass of wine at reception in the evening made all the difference. I wouldn’t look anywhere else if I was going back to Liverpool."
2235,The Resident Liverpool,Very satisfied with hotel. Staff at all levels were very polite and assisted us with all our needs swiftly. Rooms were clean and we slept very well while we were there. Locality was very good. Plenty of restaurants within walking distance and a good grocery shop minutes away. I would stay there again.
2236,The Resident Liverpool,"I had an amazing stay at The Resident hotel in Seel St, Liverpool. The hotel staff in particular, Harry and Cole were both knowledgeable and provided me with excellent customer service. I stayed in numerous hotels and apart from the hotel amenities and the quality and cleanliness of the rooms, it is always the hotel staff service that makes a difference. Well done and thank you The Resident, Liverpool for making my stay in Liverpool an unforgettable experience."
2237,The Resident Liverpool,"Honestly couldn't fault this hotel. It was one of the cheapest available during a last minute Eurovision trip so I went for it, and would 100% recommend to anyone, and revisit the next time I'm in Liverpool. I did read the reviews and thought maybe it was too good to be true but genuinely I had a fab experience here. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating, with a free upgrade, late check out and complimentary happy hour for members. The room was really clean, the bed very comfortable and the general location of the hotel was really good. One of the best value hotels I've stayed in - I've paid way more for a room like this before! Really nice :)"
2238,The Resident Liverpool,Houses in the heart of one of the liveliest areas for Liverpool nightlife The Resident is haven of calm and relaxation. Staff on the front desk were very friendly and helpful. Nothing was too much trouble. Room was very comfortable with large screen TV and fridge for cold drinks. Will definitely stay again.
2239,The Resident Liverpool,The Resident Liverpool was clean and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. Everything that we wanted to see and do was within easy walking distance. I would definitely stay again and recommend it.
2240,The Resident Liverpool,"Great hotel and location, fabulous staff, good value Rooms are really nice with good amenities, in November upgraded to superior room which was lovely. Would definitely recommend this hotel if visiting Liverpool."
2241,The Resident Liverpool,A quiet hotel close to everything in Liverpool. The rooms were big and we really enjoyed staying here. The staff gave us a lot of good tips and they were so welcoming and friendly! Will definetly be back!
2242,The Resident Liverpool,"The hotel is nice. Staff polite. The room was clean, wifi good. Tap in kitchenette sink was broken and would not turn to cold. The worst part of all was housekeeping one day decided to throw away a bag of my belongings for no reason. Had they looked inside, they'd have seen there were items of clothing inside. The best The Resident can do is offer me 50% off a future visit, but why would I want to come back when there's a 100% chance their staff steal my stuff when cleaning?"
2243,The Resident Liverpool,"So glad we discovered this gem! Great location, friendly and helpful staff, clean and comfortable and good value for money. Joining the membership scheme is definitely worthwhile and having discounts at Q parking and some restaurants is a bonus. We will definitely book again!"
2244,The Resident Liverpool,"Very good and clean hotel with nice rooms. Despite its location, you will not be bothered by the noise of the nightlife. The hotel just doesn't serve breakfast. Liverpool is a nice city for football fans and if you want to drink a beer"
2245,The Resident Liverpool,The usual excellent welcome at Reception - friendly and helpful. Good room clean and relatively spacious. Good price as a member given there was a football match on which considerably inflates hotel prices in the city
2246,The Resident Liverpool,Spot if your looking to enjoy the Liverpool sights and nightlife - The accommodation is of a very high standard with a very comfortable bed - and very spacious room -The location for the center of Liverpool is perfect with most things 15 minute walk or less away i would hesitate in booking this place again and again
2247,The Resident Liverpool,"We really enjoyed this hotel. We arrived very late, otherwise would have been greeted by complimentary drinks. Chris, the desk clerk, helped us with our bags as we struggled driving to the right spot (not used to driving on the left!). It was close to the train station, short walking distance to the Albert Dock for tours and shopping, and delicious restaurants within a few minutes. The decor was modern with a flair of original brickwork. The staff were so helpful with our navigation in Liverpool!"
2248,The Resident Liverpool,Everything about this hotel is fantastic. Location great. Hotel was spotless and beautifully decorated. Received a room upgrade. A lovely card to welcome us on our arrival which was personalised. Will definitely be back. Everything about it was excellent
2249,The Resident Liverpool,"Great location, easy walking distance from both the main railway stations. To and from Lime Street on foot with heavy bag in well under ten minutes each way. The Resident Liverpool is located a block away from the city's party district which is always lively, even midweek. Despite this, there was literally zero noise in the room at night. Room had a fridge and a microwave as well as a coffee machine. I've stayed at Hilton, Club Quarters and so on in the past in UK cities, but The Resident, for me, was a better stay all round. It's as if the company just wants to offer hospitality rather than fill a balance sheet. Revolutionary thinking in an age of meh. Staff were professional, present and helpful. Pricing was honest. Not a cheap stay but value for money. Struggling to…"
2250,The Alan,"Really enjoyed our stay at this cool hotel. Very interesting place, great stylish rooms. Enormous comfortable beds. Lovely showers with very soft plentiful towels. Great location with lots of restaurants, shopping & culture nearby. We had a couple of drinks in the bar & breakfast was fab. Unfortunately I had a fall when visiting Manchester, not in the hotel. Outside on the street & the staff were wonderful & so helpful. Especially Vee, not sure how to spell her name. She was so lovely & made sure we had everything we needed as I had very bad bump to my head. All the staff were fantastic"
2251,The Alan,"no help from so many staff members we interacted with. spoke to the host at the desk who initially was hiding in a closet? which isn’t very friendly to guests just entering. no warm welcome or anything, a bit strange. was then greeted with a card for our room that doesn’t work which we were promised that would be fixed in 10 minutes to our room. ended up receiving that new card the next day 1 hour before check out, great! breakfast was unorganised aswell, restaurant is split into two sides and we’re told its a 30 minute wait for a new table. okay. fine. i paid for it so i dont mind waiting, but what i do mind is the fact that other guests who are arriving after us are just helping themselves to other tables on the other side of the restaurant when we’ve waited 20 minutes for a…"
2252,The Alan,"Highly over rated, the staff is terrible and unhelpful. One night stay, requested an early check in, never got an answer, charged $25 pounds for it with no previous response, they don’t “take cash” could help me get breakfast after hours of travel."
2253,The Alan,"Fantastic boutique hotel right in the centre of Manchester. Service was perfect, breakfast was perfect, would score 11/10 if I could and we will be back. Discussing it on the way home, we agreed it was the best hotel we've stayed at in ages"
2254,The Alan,"Funky hotel - urban chic - very easy to check-in/out - would stay again and recommend Good breakfast choices - comfy beds and great bathroom products, large spacious rooms super central location and relaxed"
2255,The Alan,"Massive comfy bed, cool interiors, nice toiletries and free bottle of prosecco when booked through Secret Escapes. Attentive staff without being intrusive, great breakfast. Great for city centre and surrounding areas."
2256,The Alan,"Can’t fault this hotel, everything was perfect. In a great location on the edge of China Town, to ge explore what Manchester has to offer. Would 100% recommend. Staff, breakfast and the room was amazing."
2257,The Alan,Despite the hot weather the hotel was cool and airy with a restful atmosphere . All staff were friendly and quietly attentive . My bedroom / bathroom (201) spacious and the bed huge and comfortable. Breakfast was very good and changes to the menu done willingly . Situation excellent as very central and tram stop just round the corner . Would definitely recommend .
2258,The Alan,Nice room and delicious breakfast. Very friendly and helpful staff. Would happily use this hotel in the future and have no reservation in recommending it to others. It’s location in the heart of the city is perfect.
2259,The Alan,"Good location to tram, breakfast was good and beds very comfortable with rooms a very industrial feel. Maybe not to everyone taste. Paint work grubby with hand marks. Had a lot of problem with check in, make sure you have your original booking as can be over charged."
2260,The Alan,I had a fantastic two nights at The Alan. Rooms very clean and spacious. Welcome host was excellent and accommodating. Will definitely be coming back and i highly recommend this to hotel in Manchester.
2261,The Alan,"We had a wonderful stay. The room was really spacious and comfortable for 2 people. There was water, tea and coffee in the room and cool air conditioning. Everyone is really helpful and friendly. The hotel is cool and comfortable, the common areas, bar restaurant etc also have a cool vive. Great location, easy to walk everywhere"
2262,The Alan,"great hotel, laid back feel but has a touch of class. would highly recommend . clean and well set out bedroom and bathroom, the breakfast was superb, location is great and close to most things with many transport connections"
2263,The Alan,"Had a fab night away from the kids. The hotel is so gorgeous, something you’d see in Europe with contemporary style. Staff were friendly from start to finish and you have to dine there! The food is incredible!"
2264,The Alan,The entrance area bar and restaurant were nice but not that comfortable to hang around. The bedroom was only passable the furniture was tired looking and the beds mattress was the most uncomfortable one I’ve slept on. I did not get a great nights sleep. Air conditioning was non existent. The staff were nice and the breakfast very good.
2265,The Alan,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Alan. Hotel was modern and immaculately clean with everything you could need and super comfortable bed. Staff couldn't do enough to help us. Highly recommend and will be returning.
2266,The Alan,"I lived in Manchester for years and didn’t know about this hotel, now I’ve moved away and Gad the pleasure of discovering it during a recent trip back to the UK. I liked it so much I stayed there twice in a week!"
2267,The Alan,"Great location, lovely quirky decor, the Oysters and Champagne were fantastic and the welcome from check in staff was lovely. We booked through Secret Escapes and got an amazing deal, will stay again."
2268,The Alan,Lovely public area that smells amazing! Rooms great and really central location. Sofa were all really friendly and helpful. Was great that we were able to get a drink from the bar on our return from the concert.
2269,The Alan,"Lovely staff who helped quickly and efficiently. Bedroom was clean and tidy with nice features such as Bluetooth player etc. The rooms are a little Industrial looking, with exposed pipework etc but this is quite a nice feature."
2270,The Alan,"We stayed there 4 full days with 4 adults (2 Doubles). Expensive, amateuristic service especially at breakfast but also in the bar. Definitely not a 4 star experience for 250 quid a room pro night. Had a good conversation with one of the managers on the last evening listing all the ‘small things ‘ that went wrong .. nothing really bad but just too many of those especially on a short stay. We will not come back"
2271,The Alan,Very nice stay the hotel was very nice and quirky. Breakfast was included and was also very enjoyable. The hotel was very centralised - right by the tram too. Will certainly be returning when I take a trip to Manchester
2272,The Alan,"Cannot be faulted. Welcome, room, food, drink, service. An excellent find. Cleanliness, class - we had a great night here without leaving The Alan. Try all you can in the restaurant, breakfast top notch, staff attentive and friendly."
2273,The Alan,"I stayed at the Alan on 27-28th May in room 008, on the ground floor. On inspection, the room had obvious signs of wear and tear that hadn't been addressed. For example, the table edges has scuff marks, the shower temperature dial was broken off, there were marks on one of the stainless steel light stwitch holders and the sealing in the shower was scruffy and grubby. I had the feeling of being in a 3 star hotel rather than 4, and I have stayed in 3 star hotels in better condition. The hotel didn't have a much better spec than my own flat. The design of the room was awkward in some ways. There were plenty of plug sockets, but most far away from a table where you could rest your device to charge without having to extend the cable in a strange way. For some reason, the light…"
2274,The Alan,"Really nice hotel, highly recommend a stay here, great staff, comfy rooms and a cool setting, possibly one of the best hotel breakfasts I’ve had! Very central location, close to everything in the city. Really clean and spacious rooms. Don’t hesitate to book!"
2275,The Alan,"Stayed on a Monday evening for pleasure. Warm welcome on arrival. Lovely room, very minimal, bare plaster and industrial fittings. Huge bed, lovely toiletries, super bathroom. All very comfortable. Good quality breakfast, cooked to order. All the staff were lovely and helpful. Great location opposite Manchester Art gallery and next to St. Peter’s square. Would definitely recommend and we will stay again."
2276,The Alan,"Great stay - attentive staff, excellent rate and perks for booking directly and all in all a wonderful place to stay due to the central location and lovely decor of the hotel. Mini fridge in every room doesn’t seem necessary for some but as a breastfeeding mum away from her baby for the first time, this was a god send."
2277,The Alan,"The lobby is awesome, and the bar and restaurant look fabulous…although I didn’t use either. All of that looks new. In the room however, it feels old. What I thought was a USB socket is actually an old phone line connection. Some plug sockets don’t work. The desk has no chair. No plug socket any where near the kettle. And it just feels old!"
2278,The Alan,"Every part of the hotel appeared clean, environmentally friendly and everyone we came across was helpful and had a smile on their face. The rooms were spacious, the toiletries smelt amazing! Comfy bed, good tv, great breakfast and easy processes at check in and check out. Thank you"
2279,The Alan,Lovely hotel and friendly staff. Service was great and staff were very accommodating. The hotel location was absolutely spot on for the theatre and I would definitely book again. The breakfast was also delicious
2280,The Alan,Very stylish and modern in decor in the foyer and public spaces. Good and varied small plates meal and excellent breakfast. Small bedroom on top floor with uninspiring view. Good sized clean bathroom with nice toiletries. Washed my hair and then found out that the hairdryer didn’t work.
2281,The Alan,"This hotel was fantastic- start to finish! Check in was easy and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was beautifully appointed and the bed was super comfortable after a long day of sightseeing around Manchester! The shower was absolutely brilliant and I would love to get one just like it for my home! One of my favorite things about the hotel was the amazing food! You don’t usually get fantastic fare at a hotel restaurant, but I would recommend the food to anyone and everyone! My Aunt and I had the privilege of meeting Jan our amazing breakfast server! He was quick, funny, knowledgeable and an absolute delight to get to know! If I am able to make it to Manchester again, I will certainly stay at The Alan, and I enjoyed my stay so much I might even make a special…"
2282,The Alan,"Very good overall. We were in one of the master rooms. They may seem quirky as they look quite spartan/unfinished but this is how they've been designed and if you look closer delicate touches make it work well. The bed was very comfortable and all you'd need for a weekend away in the city. Nice sized TV but kudos for the sound system. Small but powerful enough to power your pre drink party going!! Cleverly no iron but a steamer and the table doubles as an ironing board if you'd rather do it that way. Plenty of hangars, tea tray and kettle. Even a mini fridge that was plugged in and cold on arrival if required. The bathroom whilst very nice did have a few niggles for me. The hot water output felt it was coming from Mars. At 7am as I'm getting a shower it took a full 10mins of…"
2283,The Alan,"10/10. Staff were great, Hotel is clean and the decor is quirky and fresh, Rooms are very spacious and the bed was massive. 100% recommend to anyone wanting to stay and feel like they are somewhere special"
2284,The Alan,"Booked through Wowcher for a beautiful spacious room with a bottle of Prosecco included on each night for a total off £230. Not a cheap bottle of Prosecco either😉 Feels like a 5 star hotel, Modern, Smart and different. Huge room with a massive bed more than enough for two people, The bathroom is stunning, Tv was massive and I loved the decor. Staff are brilliant, Always smiling always helpful. Had breakfast included on both nights, The first morning had The Alan Full English, Have to say it was a bit of a let down as I thought it just didn’t taste right but the second morning the smoked salmon made up for it. Staff in the restaurant were very good, Well mannered and attentive. You feel like you’re famous when staying here!"
2285,The Alan,Great hotel in a good location. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was high quality. Check out on a Sunday is 12.30 which we were unaware of as Expedia has it listed as 11.00. Overall would highly recommend this hotel.
2286,The Alan,"Very Helpful staff, good pre stay communication, swift check in process, everything we needed available in the room, bar had a lovely atmosphere. Good deal with breakfast. Good location. Would stay again!"
2287,The Alan,"Excellent hotel, centrally located, great entrance, bar and eating areas. Competitively priced for central Manchester. Staff very pleasant. Best Full English breakfast I have had in years! Would definitely return."
2288,The Alan,"the Alan hotel is very centrally located with great access to most of the attractions in Manchester. It is a very cool, chic hotel with great staff and service. The facilities are excellent and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in."
2289,The Alan,"Upon entering The Alan the automatic doors didn't work and with my work gear and suitcase it was a bit hard work. My comoany had paid for my room so wasn't sure why my drivers licence was copied. Also the additional £1.20 Manchester stays tax should just be upfront in the price. Then you're asked for a £50 deposit.... first time this has happened at a hotel as a business traveller. The room was a little tired as there were marks on several walls. For business travellers there's no chair near the desk. The room was right opposite large offices and offered no shielding other than blocking the daylight out with the curtains so it was just dark. Some plug sockets didnt work. The bathroom was lovely and there was a decent selection of products. I slept well, the bed was comfy.…"
2290,The Alan,"The room was fine, perfectly clean. Road-side rooms are a little noisy with the windows open, but you'll live with that in a city. Staff perfectly pleasant. I'm not sure why a hotel needs to record images of its guests' ID cards? When I responded that I had neither passport nor drivers licence with me (why would I? I am a British resident travelling in Britain) the hosts appeared incredulous. They eventually settled fro my wife's driver's licence. I'm not sure where The Alan thinks we were going to defraud it, as the room was prepaid, which means they already had my checked and confirmed payment details on file. The additional £50 deposit didn't leave me feeling like I was an honoured guest either."
2291,The Alan,"The style of the Alan is not for everyone, the plaster walls make it look unfinished.The cleanliness was 1/10 rubbish on floors someone's medication on floor, someone sick on sink, in ripples on outside. Very loud music from room above.Noisy outside. Saving grace breakfast 10/10, food fabulous,staff great, cooked to order Only other downside photo ID and £50 card to stay.Prior notice of this would be good. Not sure this warranty four stars anymore."
2292,The Alan,"Perfect hotel, really clean and exciting lobby. Check in was great, we got an upgraded room which was lovely and booked a meal at the hotel We loved the room, so clean and big. Bathroom was lovely. Our only issue was the air on, it didn’t work, on whatever setting it was on no cold air would come out of it. I can’t recommend enough in having a meal at the Alan, the food was so good, very good value for money and the cocktails were fantastic! We will definitely be visiting again!"
2293,The Alan,"Great hotel, friendly staff and very comfortable rooms with unique retro industrial decor. The welcome hostess was very nice to deal with. The only thing that let this place down was the very poor breakfast."
2294,The Alan,"If you haven’t eaten at “The Alan”it is a must….Me and my wife booked for our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. We had previously dined at a restaurant called the “MOOR”which head chef James used to own,who now has the kitchen in “The Alan”. We were served and waited on by a lovely bubbly girl called Jkintija,who couldn’t do enough for us,even taking pictures. She recommended dishes which we picked and were incredible,she was certainly the hostess with the mostest. Not only is the food that good,we will being going back,it’s the staff that made the night as well."
2295,The Alan,A very cool place nice old building greeted as we walked in and felt at home instantly. The bed was huge and sooo comfortable. Central enough so we could walk pretty much anywhere plus it’s a street away from China town.
2296,The Alan,"Spent an extorionate amount on a room I could've paid far less for at a premier inn. Make sure when you're booking that you don't pick the Original Double - it is a shabby, basic disaster of a hotel room. It looks nothing like the pictures of the other rooms so excessively advertised or the style of the hotel lobby area. I booked this as a surprise, romantic weekend away for me and my partner and it was the furthest thing from romantic - so disappointed and embarassed. Things we experienced in our room: 1. No plug socket next to one side of the bed (not even a USB - for a modern hotel this is disappointing) 2. Noise so loud at night (drunks shouting, police/ambulance sirens CONSTANT) we had to close the window, but so warm and humid in the room that we had to put the air con on…"
2297,The Alan,Great location and staff were very helpful. Loved the retro look of the hotel with the unfinished aspects. Good full English but ran out of bacon?( how does that happen) Check in and check out very easy. Accommodation was very nice in all. Will return if bacon guaranteed at breakfast.
2298,The Alan,"The hotel has a modern ‘industrial’ unfinished off look, bare plaster walls and exposed pipe work. My husband liked it but I didn’t. The girls were friendly and efficient at check in. For the price we paid for one night (£160) I would have expected a selection of fruit/herbal teas in our room along with some biscuits, it was disappointing to only have coffee and traditional tea on offer. Lots of design faults in the room such as the sink in the bathroom doesn’t have a plug and the tap is so long and faces the front of the basin so when you turn the tap on, the water flows up the front of the basin and on to your clothes and feet. Shampoo and soap smells so strong and irritated my skin. Breakfast (full English) was lukewarm but we hadn’t got time to send it back as we had a…"
2299,The Alan,My husband and I stayed in this hotel on BH weekend. It is a stunning hotel . The staff made us feel very welcome and valued customers. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. We had a full English breakfast which was probably the best I have ever tasted! Would highly recommend this unique hotel
2300,"The Grand, York","From the moment we arrived at The Grand and were greeted by the Concierge we found the staff to be very friendly and courteous. The room was spotlessly clean and decorated to a high standard. The bar was a great place to enjoy a relaxing drink, made even better by the live music. We would highly recommend The Grand for a great stay in York."
2301,"The Grand, York","Myself and my Husband visited The Grand Hotel 10 to 12 June 2023 , for our wedding Anniversary and my Birthday. We was so glad we came , after receiving some really devastating new the day before we arrived ! we were unsure wether to come or not .However we made the decision to come as we really needed to get away from it all , were glad we did . It was a superb weekend weather wise and absolutely everything was perfect from the parking at the hotel to cases been in our room .Lovely chocolate in the room and a card to wish us Happy Anniversary. The rooms are spacious, clean and everything we needed .The bathrooms are huge with lovely toiletries . Breakfast was lovely and the spa treatment and facilities just perfect . Although we had bad news before our arrival it did help take…"
2302,"The Grand, York",Fantastic hotel accommodations and services. Extremely comfortable and luxuriously spacious classic double room. Large well lit bathroom with good fluffy towels and toiletries. Mini fridge kept our drinks very cold.
2303,"The Grand, York","Me and my wife stayed here for a couple of days to get away and process my, All Clear, results of my bowel cancer treatment, All the staff and management team were absolutely fantastic, we was made to feel very special and I know everyone was genuinely happy for us, it was a wonderful stay everything was just perfect, I would not hesitate at all to recommend this hotel it is fantastic."
2304,"The Grand, York","We had a lovely stay in this heritage York hotel for 3 nights . Our family room was massive with huge picture windows and a beautifully appointed bathroom. The location is the best in York, with everything like the Shambles or York Minster or Jorvik Museum just a stroll away!! The only reason for a point off was that the first day , the housekeeping service was a tad shoddy (carpets not vacuumed, glasses/toiletries not replaced) , but after we let the staff know, that we were expecting a full service from a 5-star establishment such as theirs, they were excellent for the remaining days. Overall a fabulous stay and we’ll definitely be back ."
2305,"The Grand, York","Second visit to the Grand in six months. It’s a premium experience from the moment you arrive. Ian on concierge is just the best. He’s professional and down to earth. He gives great advice on local attractions and epitomizes the attention to detail that all the staff at the Grand bring to the table. Our room was spacious and modern with a great bathroom. Breakfast in the restaurant is not to be missed. Excellent buffet with menu options. The bar is great but does get busy. The location is so convenient with the Minster maybe 7 minutes walk. Parking is close by but a little pricey, you do get a discount validation from the Grand that knocks of £6 a day. All in all the Grand is well worth the money if you’re visiting York, pay the extra and enjoy a premium experience. Highly…"
2306,"The Grand, York","Better to pre book the spa. We stayed for my partners birthday. Eat at the Legacy if you can, its fantastic. The Grand is nice and central easy to walk into York..A really worthwhile experience, worth every penny."
2307,"The Grand, York",We came to celebrate our anniversary the hotel was great a nice little touch with a anniversary card and chocolates in the room we both loved our time there and will definitely be back location was great was quiet in the room even with it been busy out and the ac was great with it been red hot over the weekend cant review the food and drink as already had plans elsewhere but looked very nice and will be trying next time
2308,"The Grand, York",There took a £50 deposit from me and i had a accident which involved bleeding. Not very pleasant about it and charged me £900. Will definitely not go back and will be seeking advice. They took the payment without even consulting me. Stay well clear
2309,"The Grand, York",Beautiful Hotel in a great location. Service & amenities first class.Staff accessible & friendly. I would recommend & come again. York is well with a visit with its beautiful cathedral. A short train visit to Harrogate is also a must.
2310,"The Grand, York",A fantastic old building in very good location. The staff were excellent. The rooms were large and comfortable. The first room we were given was overlooking the entrance and very noisy at night. They did move us and the 2nd room was much better. I would comment that the taps in both rooms were very stiff and difficult to get temperature of water right. The pool and gym were very good. Overall a nice stay.
2311,"The Grand, York",Reservation made in Dec 22 for a stay in Jun 23 via a “contact”; discovered just before our stay identical room etc £60 cheaper! They use “dynamic pricing” (pricing changes based on demand!). Contact reduced my rate however the principle is disgraceful! Beware before you book!
2312,"The Grand, York","The rooms are nice but need updating, the staff were truly wonderful, exceptional food and really good size portions, overall not bad price. Position excellent as near to all amenities.Will definitely stay again."
2313,"The Grand, York",The Grand is an excellent hotel and all the staff who work here are friendly and go out of their way to make your stay most memorable. The hotel is located only a short walk from the railway station and the attractions in York are all near by.
2314,"The Grand, York",Fabulous from start to finish! Beautiful place with lovely facilities and wonderful staff who just make the experience perfect! Ideal location for enjoying everything York has to offer. Would definitely recommend and hopefully we’ll be back!
2315,"The Grand, York","An absolutely beautiful hotel and smells amazing. The room was really lovely, very comfortable bed and lovely little details. The bar was nice and breakfast was very very tasty. All staff very attentive. Thanks for a lovely stay, will definitely recommend"
2316,"The Grand, York","The room was spacious, clean and well equipped. The service was first class. The breakfast was exceptionally varied and of high quality. The staff were genuinely friendly and offered help and advice when needed"
2317,"The Grand, York","Would have to say that The grand has been an experience like I have rarely felt. The Hotel was as you would expect from a 4/5 star establishment, but what makes the Grand that bit extra Special are the Staff!. From the doormen who greet you, the concierge who are there to support you, the reception staff who are totally helpful and the Cleaning staff, everyone is so helpful, friendly and take the time of day to greet you and to actually talk to you and make you feel special. Then there are the Bar and Dining room staff, I would have to give a special shout out to Gemma in the lounge Bar and Rayne in The Rise restaurant, and the Head Waiter and Wine waiter whose names I did not get, am I Bad?, but all were attentive, friendly, totally customer/client focussed and making the…"
2318,"The Grand, York","WOW! Beautiful facility, well appointed and the staff is so kind, accommodating and joyful. Jordy the concierge MADE our trip so lovely, the woman who checked us in and helped with the upgrade to the suites on the 5th floor was brilliant and our daily wait staff, including Dan, served with humor - the food was fantastic And all those too numerous to mention - thank you for your smiles and efficiency The location is convincing to the wall and all the attractions York has to offer We were so blessed Definitely go!!"
2319,"The Grand, York","I have just arrived home from a 2 night stay at this wonderful hotel the service and staff are absolutely amazing cannot do enough for you. The food at breakfast was a good selection our only complaint would be it could have been warmer. The room was very clean and the bed comfortable lovely pillows, unfortunately traffic noise did keep us awake during the night. I would highly recommend this hotel close to the centre and train station overall a good experience and I would definitely return maybe request a room away from the road noise."
2320,"The Grand, York",Stayed in this hotel for 3days and wish it was for longer. If you are going to visit York then you have to stay here. The staff was excellent in all departments. The location for all travellers perfect.
2321,"The Grand, York","Where do I begin ,staying at The Grand has been magical.Has soon as we arrived we were warmly greeted by the doormen ,who treated us with courtesy .Our suitcase was delivered by the porter efficiently.All the reception staff were amazing (sorry I did not write everyone’s name) Sandra was very kind and thoughtful.The executive room ,went beyond our wildest dreams ,so comfortable ,although the pillows were fuller than what we were used too .We usually sleep on flatter pillows . The room was beautifully clean . A hand written card with chocolates was greeting us when we entered the room. I visited the swimming pool a few times it was smashing . I was a bit apprehensive about the holiday ,has my husband is very I’ll,he enjoyed it so much we rebooked before we left . Thank you…"
2322,"The Grand, York","My daughter and I stayed here recently for a few nights on a mini break to York. We were very impressed with the hotel, it is in a great location, easy walking distance to the train station and the town/tourist areas. The hotel staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful from the moment we walked up to the door. We had a lovely, large room in the old part of the hotel with high ceilings and good views of the city walls. The beds were very comfortable and the room was quiet. We booked with the 'Discover York' package, which included dinner and afternoon tea, both of which were excellent. The breakfast selection was extensive and all very tasty. We would highly recommend this hotel and are looking forward to coming back again in the future."
2323,"The Grand, York",Lovely hotel. Very clean and the room was fantastic. I have to say best hotel I have stayed in when visiting York. The staff very friendly and welcoming. Nice touch having extra pillows. The fridge was great and plenty of room to put things in. Nothing was too much trouble here. Fresh milk too in the fridge and not UHT milk which was a bonus and Yorkshire tea provided. Did not use the spa as comfortable in the room provided. We stayed in the classic double room and was worth the money. Would recommend and would stay again.
2324,"The Grand, York","My family recently stayed at the Grand and it was absolutely wonderful! The location is fantastic - just a 5 minute walk from the train station, and it’s a short lovely stroll to the center of town. The building is beautiful - our rooms were very spacious and comfortable. And above all, the staff was all so friendly and helpful! Breakfast was great, the bar was terrific, and the pool was nice, too! We had a wonderful visit and would absolutely stay here again! Thanks for the hospitality!"
2325,"The Grand, York",The whole process at The Grand was amazing. Check in was smooth and so was check out. The room was clean and spacious. The Legacy had delicious food. I will be staying there next time I am in York and I will suggest it to all my friends as well.
2326,"The Grand, York","This hotel is truly a great treat. It's old world charm mixed with the modern conveniences, and the service is top of the line. Our room was extremely spacious, and a beautiful mixture of old world with modern conveniences throughout. The service from the front door to the front desk and restaurants was amongst the best we have experienced anywhere."
2327,"The Grand, York","Lovely hotel, very friendly and welcoming staff. We stayed 4 nights and had a family room which was a nice size and we had a great view and the under floor heating in the bathroom was a nice touch. The only disappointment was the housekeeping staff kept leaving us two bath towels in the bathroom instead of 3 when there were 3 of us in the room and they didnt top up the tea tray so we had to ask a couple of times for the extra towel and for the tea to be filled up. We also had turn down service one time only which only seemed to happen when we asked for the missing bath towel on the last night. Not sure why the turn down service wasnt every night. Location of hotel was very central and the NCP car park was expensive but very well located across the road from the hotel. We…"
2328,"The Grand, York","Despite living near to York all my life I’m still gobsmacked that should a prestigious venue was right on my doorstep, and I had no idea. The décor, amenities, atmosphere and professionalism of all the staff were all second to none and elevated the already impressive site to new levels. On top of the above the Legacy Restaurant was an experience unto itself. The quality of the food and the variety was breath-taking, and while some of those dishes wouldn’t have been my first choice on paper, they all delivered such a pristine eating experience like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. My most heartfelt compliments to the chef, cookery team and service staff for delivering such a wonderful, truly one of a kind."
2329,"The Grand, York","Great experience. The location of the hotel was ideal. The view from our room was lovely and the room was light and airy. There was cake and a card in our room on arrival left for my little girl as we stayed as a birthday treat, lovely touch. The staff were amazing and consistently went the extra mile for us. Breakfast was lovely, great selection and nice surroundings. We will most definitely be back."
2330,"The Grand, York","Undoubtedly one of the best hotels in York, perfect location, beautiful rooms and genuinely helpful staff. We won’t be staying anywhere else in future. Quick and easy access to spa, room service food was divine and very cosy bar area. Worth every penny"
2331,"The Grand, York",Based on our four night stay this is just one lovely hotel. Full amenities in the room with very spacious bathroom. A few minutes (say 6- 8) walk to the main shopping/tourist area and closer still to the train station. Welcoming and friendly staff. Breakfast was very good with the french toast being a stand out. Contact prior to to arrival was about the best I've come across. Wouldn't even think about staying elsewhere in York. Just have to go back.
2332,"The Grand, York","We stayed here for my wife's 60th birthday, and the room and the meal we had in Legacy were very expensive. However it was Bank Holiday weekend, with Racing on, and other hotels were comparably priced. Our room was fantastic, and Legacy was a real experience. Overall very glad we went."
2333,"The Grand, York","Went here during our honeymoon, best hotel we experienced in the UK by far, especially considering price. Walking distance to everything, clean and comfortable room, great in house amenities! Would recommend it to anyone staying in York or Northern England."
2334,"The Grand, York",I recently had a lovely trip to York and throughly enjoyed my stay at The Grand hotel. In particular the wonderful service at The Rise from Ned was outstanding and he went above and beyond for me which was absolutely lovely.
2335,"The Grand, York","Another excellent stay, myself and my wife visit York regularly and have tried many of the hotels,but the grand always delivers the staff are so friendly the bars are great and the pool/spa is great,my wife says the club sandwiches and breakfast is the best she has had.we park at the hotel which is £35 but it is worth it for convenience due to all the car parks all been busy We are here now chilling for my birthday"
2336,"The Grand, York",The staffs are friendly and helpful. Hotel location is so great and is very near to train station and many main attractions. The hemisphere of the hotel is very elegant and beautiful. I have had a wonderful experience here.
2337,"The Grand, York","The absolute best hotel! Thanks to the outstanding staff, who during our many stays, have become friends, especially the head concierge Jordi who has always gone out of his way to accommodate us....We always look forward to our stays and shall continue to return as often as we can. Denise &Pete"
2338,"The Grand, York",Excellent hotel made even better by the front door staff and the head concierge Jordi. He makes our stays very special and there's nothing that's too much trouble for him. He's the reason we return all the time because we know we'll be looked after. Always a pleasure...
2339,"The Grand, York","My wife and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel, excellent accommodation. Our stay was made even better by the service we received from the staff especially the head concierge, Jordi Vaca and his team. His help and attention made us feel very special, so we have booked to stay on two more occasions this year."
2340,"The Grand, York","The Grand just gets better everytime we go. Jordi the head concierge cannot do enough to make our stay even more perfect. He is always there to greet us in the most professional manner and nothing is ever too much trouble for him. He makes us feel special every time we visit. The cocktails are amazing, especially the strawberry shortbread, the spa was the perfect way to relax and unwind and the rooms are luxury. We wouldn't stay anywhere else."
2341,"The Grand, York","We stayed for 3 nights with friends. We stayed previously some years ago when I believe it was the “Cedar Court”. It was excellent then and probably even better now. As soon as you arrive the service at check in and Concierge is top class. Everything dealt with efficiently and with a smile. All the staff were very polite and friendly throughout. Our room was finished to a high spec as do all the hotel facilities. Breakfast is a bit pricey but plenty of hot and cold choice plus a la carte orders available from the kitchen Great position between the railway station, river and its centre. Very much recommended for comfort and style"
2342,"The Grand, York",Great double room but did have the bottle bin being emptied early in the morning which woke me. Bar and restaurant staff very friendly and engaging . Great location with amazing facilities will defo stay again but just request a different room .
2343,"The Grand, York","I really enjoyed my stay here. It is very close to the station and easy to get to all the attractions in York. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was great, as was breakfast. The bar is fantastic - love the live music but would've liked some nibbles with my drink! I would definitely stay here again."
2344,"The Grand, York","Superb hotel,with very friendly amenable staff.Upgrafed to an executive room,well worth it for the extra space and a lovely walk in shower.Breakfast was either a meal that would last you the whole day ,just cereals and fruit (if thats your take on it!!) or something just to break the fast.... choice is fantastic.Spa facilities are perfect for an extra bit of relaxation.Perfect location for exploring the lovely city of York.What more can we say...repeat visit looming.."
2345,"The Grand, York",Very efficient and helpful. Room very clean. Staff very helpful. Bathroom well stocked which is always useful. Valet parking available which saved a lot of time. Overall a very enjoyable stay and would recommend to family and friends.
2346,"The Grand, York","We stayed at The Grand with the family, and what an experience it was. Nothing was too much for The Grand, any request for transport was sorted immediately. We have stayed on many occasions and will continue to stay. Special mentions to Elliott for helping us with everything we needed, and all of the concierge team for their dedication with smooth luggage transfers"
2347,"The Grand, York","From first impressions to last, The Grand lives up to its name, and is the best hotel we have stayed in within this country. We had an unexpected second night stay due to train issues, so had the unusual pleasure of staying in the original side one night, and the modern the next night. We preferred the older side, but both were excellent. Highly recommend a stay"
2348,"The Grand, York","We went for a relaxing break and it was truly wonderful. The staff especially were all very professional, attentive, helpful and at the same time very friendly. The breakfast options are the best we have ever experienced, in fact it was one of the reasons for booking this hotel. Thank you"
2349,"The Grand, York","We drove to York there and is an NCP car park literally a minutes walk from the hotel, a little pricey however you do get a small discount with the hotel, alternatively hotel parking is £35 per night. The station is only 3/4 minutes away. The hotel is perfectly located for all sights. Our check in was seamless, concierge, doormen and staff are always on hand to help. Our room was fabulous, spacious and spotless, with top quality bedding, towels and bath robes. All faultless. A special shout out to the housekeeping team who were always delightful. We had breakfast at the hotel on one of our mornings, it’s not cheap (£25 pp), take the time to then relax, pace yourself and it will set you up for the day. The bar area is lovely and the staff friendly, efficient and great…"
2350,Claridge's,"What a special hotel. Immaculate rooms and foyer area, located so centrally in London. The history alone makes it worthwhile for a visit. Air conditioned and also large double doors in the room that opened onto a small veranda. Views across the roof tops while we had an afternoon drink. Fabulous food in the restaurant, both breakfast and dinner. Great service. There was a terrific concierge who helped us with ideas for the days we visited and his humour and assistance was so helpful. Wished we could have stayed longer. Thanks Claridges for making London so special."
2351,Claridge's,"We had wonderful visit to Clardige’s where we were greeted by John and Craig at the door, served cocktails by lovely Antonio and then Sandy checked we had enjoyed ourselves on the way out. Outstanding service from everyone thank you. Clardige’s was my bucket list, however this will not be a one off visit."
2352,Claridge's,"We loved being back at Claridge’s, the staff are very friendly, the food is great, the service is a five star service. La grande dame par excellence. It makes you feel proud being British. Great management and excellent service from the doormen to the top management."
2353,Claridge's,"Great visit and to see the refurbishment first hand , wonderful atmosphere. Quality food , wine and service, a wonderful evening meal from start to finish, great to have a tour of the wine cellar Thank you"
2354,Claridge's,"After having already visited others 5 stars of prestige in London, I have to say Claridge’s deserves a full round 10 for the hotel, the staff, the restaurant, the rooms. Breakfast, meals and tea - time in the Foyer are a unique experience on their own. Overall a marvelous hotel where the most superlative and refined no - pompous elegance is accompanied by the most modern services and efficiency from the check in to the check out. From the moment in which you step in you are wrapped into a time - less experience where tradition and manners are cherished and brought forward for what appears to be a genuine desire to make you feel at home. The professionalism, friendliness and kindness of the staff is at the highest level and the feeling is to enter into a place where also who…"
2355,Claridge's,Our first stay at Claridges and it will not be our last. The staff were so good and Nigel at the concierge was so helpful even arranging for us to have Skate for our dinner which was not on the menu. A big thank you to Paul Jackson for making my birthday stay memorable. We will be back .
2356,Claridge's,"Visited for my wife’s birthday and our anniversary. Had afternoon tea in the foyer, drinks and food in Claridges bar in the evening and stayed in one of the Claridges Rooms as part of their romantic packages (including pink champagne and souvenir monogrammed bathrobes). Everything was just out of this world. Just amazing from start to finish."
2357,Claridge's,"Myself and my husband arrived on the 19/05 for 2 nights to celebrate his birthday. I contacted the hotel prior to arriving to arrange a birthday suprise. Niamh in guest relations was so helpful and arranged for balloons with photos of us on and a cake to be in the room on arrival. It looked amazing upon entering the room so a big thank you to Niamh. We checked in with Max who also showed us around and then to our room. Very helpful and friendly. The room wasnt quite ready when we arrived so he arranged for us to have complimentary drinks in the bar which was a lovely touch. We stayed in a Mayfair balcony room which was so spacious, decorated beautifully and just had everything you needed. We also added the romantic package on which included a bottle of champagne, chocolate…"
2358,Claridge's,"Well what can I say, my husband and I came to Claridges for a weekend stay over the bank holiday. We were greeted with warm smiles and happy faces. We were told that our room had a leak and was upgraded to a beautiful suite with a terrace. The duty manager was very apologetic and showed us to our suite. I cannot describe how beautiful it was and so very modern and spacious. I was blown away. We had dinner reservations, but because we loved the suite so much , we decide to have room service and eat on the terrace to really enjoy the room,before going out into London for the evening. I’m so glad we did. We had our own butler and she was so attentive and bought us champagne as it was my birthday and a little cake with a candle. I was made to feel very special. When we returned…"
2359,Claridge's,"Wow, we just had the most amazing weekend celebrating out 25th wedding anniversary. Claridge’s you went above and beyond any expectations we had. Craig when you opened the cab door and showed us to reception, ladies you where so happy to see us, it was like being welcomed home, and Sarah in guest relations, you made us so happy I cried twice! Dinner was out of this world as where the cocktails. Claridge’s you spoiled us, and we cannot thank you enough. Until next time x"
2360,Claridge's,"Julia and I had lunch at Claridges to celebrate our 40 anniversary: also happened to be my birthday too. We both loved the Foyer and Reading room restaurant. Great atmosphere and surroundings. I had scallops, the Claridges chicken pie and the apple tarte-tatin for dessert. All superbly cooked and tasty. Spoil yourself. Our waiter Punna was so good to us and made the afternoon so special."
2361,Claridge's,"What’s not to love. In about 200 words, which shouldn’t be compulsory guys, Claridge’s is simple the best hotel my wife & I have stayed at in the world. Its elegance from the outside is outdone when you walk through the doors. Our room, its dimensions decorations, bed & bathroom are superb and made our stay simply the best. We even has a swim in the new pool in the underground Spa. This is an experience we shall never forget."
2362,Claridge's,"Me and my wife had a fantastic time at claridges for our afternoon tea, Attila our server was absolutely amazing. Highly recommend the service was the best I've seen. Attila was checking in as soon as our plates and drinks were finished and was always happy to assist and help with any problem's. The food and drinks were top class. Highly recommend for a special treat."
2363,Claridge's,"Stayed twice in the last 5 months. Absolutely love the new spa and the renovated higher level floors. Breakfast is fantastic (make the most of it) but above all else is the service. Pre/post stay correspondence is great, not too much and not too little. When you are actually staying, the staff can’t do enough for you. Alex on reception is brilliant as are many of the other staff too. We will continue to visit."
2364,Claridge's,"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff = wonderful stay. We had the perfect weekend, thank you everyone at Claridges for making us feel so welcome. Special mention to Rob the Doorman and Tayyab on reception for all his help. We will definitely be back very soon."
2365,Claridge's,"I think we all know the physical side to Claridge's is second to none. The decor is exquisite and brand new. Everything is beautiful. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They are friendly, humble, welcoming and kind. This is what really makes a hotel stay truly comfortable. You're able to fully relax as you know you're in good hands. Special mention to Vladut - what a star, and what a smile! Thank you."
2366,Claridge's,Claridge's always delivers. The perfect night away celebrating my birthday; the team will go above and beyond to meet your requests. Our room was upgraded upon arrival & it was absolutely stunning. Highly recommend.
2367,Claridge's,"Perfect in every single way! Seamless check in. Beautiful rooms, comfiest beds in the world. Dyson hairdryers! Excellent staff always ready to do even more than you expect. Fantastic spa, incredible massage and a couple of hours lounging by the pool was heavenly. Breakfast service can be a little slow so allow lots of time. Dreaming of getting back. My favourite London hotel."
2368,Claridge's,"A wonderful two night stay, the whole team made us feel wonderfully welcome and I can’t recommend the hotel highly enough. Food, drink and service throughout the hotel are frankly second to none. The location is frankly hard to beat, especially with the Elizabeth line just around the corner now."
2369,Claridge's,"This was our first visit to Claridge's. For many years, I have heard it sets the standard for London's hotels. It is absolutely true - Every part of the hotel and the service it provides is first rate."
2370,Claridge's,After an absence of 18 months we were able to admire the added rooms and new facilities like the extensive Spa and indoor pool. No expenses were spared which should make the hotel the top destination in London.
2371,Claridge's,"What a luxurious stay in a Claridge's Suite while I was in town to celebrate a friend's milestone birthday. The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom and especially the bathtub was divine and there was a Dyson supersonic hairdryer in the room! No sub-standard hair dryers here! The staff were perfectly attentive - breakfast in The Foyer & Reading Room and drinks in The Fumoir were perfect. Everything is done to the highest standards here."
2372,Claridge's,A really beautiful hotel with the friendliest of staff & a superb Japanese inspired serene Spa. We stayed in one of the Art Deco rooms which had a lovely colour palette & a well-fitted out bathroom with Anatome toiletries. The Afternoon Tea with champagne was delicious & there was piano music being played too. The Fumoir Bar is a lovely setting for cocktails to round off the evening. I would definitely visit again.
2373,Claridge's,"Lovely hotel and excellent, friendly staff. Food is very good and the hotel is very efficiently run. In-room dining is very quick and beautifully served. Keep ready cash for expressing approval of great service."
2374,Claridge's,Fantastic from beginning to end. Words can't express the excellence experienced. The hotels loccation is ideal for visiting all of the major attractions. Our score of excellent understates the actual experience. The service was spot on! Relaxed & very prompt which was set of against a backdrop that was an example of art deco at its finest.
2375,Claridge's,"We arrived early at Claridges on the bank holiday and headed straight for the concierge desk. We met a lovely elderly gentleman who took care of our baggage, and offered to give us a call when our room was ready. This was nice but not necessary as we were heading for the theatre and dinner. We arrived back at the hotel early evening and checked in with a lovely young lady who showed us our fantastic room. She told us about the hotel complimentary items, which came with our booking and directed us to the breakfast/dinner areas and the location of the bars. Room service is prompt and all the staff are respectful. In the evening, we went for drinks and some snack food, which was served just as per our requests in Claridges bar. We listened to some relaxing music which was also very…"
2376,Claridge's,"Our third visit to this exquisite hotel, but our first since its refurbishment. Off the scale luxury. Stayed for 5 days over Easter. The staff are exceptional, personable, polite and fun, making our stay perfect. Special thanks to John the head doorman, an absolute legend and Jorge in Claridge’s bar. The spa and pool are a fabulous addition to the hotel. Many thanks to all at the hotel who work so hard to deliver excellence. Look forward to visiting again soon."
2377,Claridge's,"Visited Claridge's bar on a busy Friday night. The staff were extremely well versed on local information, the hotel development and recommendations for the drinks and food menu. Mario was extremely attentive to our needs and his friendly manner made us feel very welcome when visiting the hotel. A special date night for me and my partner. Many thanks"
2378,Claridge's,"After 45 years living abroad and staying at many different excellent London hotels when visiting home, I returned to Claridges this May. So many ‘wasted’ stays. As when I left it remains the standard. Thank you everyone for the perfect stay."
2379,Claridge's,"Overall a disappointing stay. I had very high expectations that unfortunately were not met. The staff were wonderful but the room, furnishings, air quality and value for money spent were very disappointing. Unfortunately, I’m unable to recommend a stay at Claridges to friends and colleagues."
2380,Claridge's,"Claridge's is the very best, an outstanding hotel with fantastic people. We came to see the King & Queen, that's how we felt at the end of our stay. A truly exceptional visit, we will return again at Christmas."
2381,Claridge's,"I spent a good few hours at the spa followed by a bamboo and silk massage. The massage therapist was very knowledgeable on the body and took the time to understand what my body needed. I came out feeling amazing and chilled, which was the main reason for my visit - to destress! Thank you."
2382,Claridge's,"Another wonderful stay at our London ""Home"". Even though the team were under pressure with the various VIP's that were staying due to attending the Coronation, this did not impact at all on our enjoyment of the weekend. From Claudia in Guest Relations to Glenn in The Foyer and Denis in The Bar and with Paul Jackson as General Manager, Claridge's is in great hands to remain the best of the best in London."
2383,Claridge's,"What a sensational dinner in the private dining room. The room was lovely, the food was fabulous, the service was wonderful and the guests were fun and interesting. What more could you want? I would highly recommend the hotel as a venue for a private dinner."
2384,Claridge's,"This is my favourite place in the world. There aren't the words to describe how lovely the staff, decor and food/drink are; you have to simply try it and you will never want to leave. I have returned many times in the past 12 years, whether to stay or just for a coffee/martini and Claridges never fails to deliver. I always feel at home, cared for and rested & relaxed by the time I leave."
2385,Claridge's,"This is more than just a 'bed' and a place to sleep. It is a whole experience. I travelled with my adult son and from the second our cab pulled up to the moment we left, we were treated like exclusive VIPs. Claridge's staff are its finest asset. Sure the building is beautiful and the luxury touches are also welcome (memory foam slippers, ultra-lux bath products) but it's the staff that make this hotel what it is - a true five star hotel. We arrived very early and expected to be told our room would be ready later at the 3pm check in time. Instead, we were ushered to the quiet bar area, presented with coffee and sublime shortbread biscuits and a short while later, our room was ready. We had the standard room with breakfast package for 800 pounds. I am not a rich person - I'm just…"
2386,Claridge's,"We consider this the best hotel in the world. We were treated like royalty by every staff member we encountered. The dining, guest rooms, spa treatments, and tea are otherworldly. The location is the very best in London. This is a treat for mind, body, and soul. We cannot wait to return."
2387,Claridge's,"Lives up to the reputation of being a beautiful, classy, luxury hotel. Rooms are gorgeous and service is unparalleled. Especially enjoyed the bath robes and slippers in the room. The breakfast is delicious and the bars are fancy. Next time I will have to visit the spa and check out the shops!"
2388,Claridge's,"I have stayed at them all. Claridges remains the best…..I miss the old room decor, though ubiquitous style seems unavoidably endemic to hotel design these days. With that said, it is still a top notch experience through and through."
2389,Claridge's,The hotel is centrally located of Oxford St and it's about 2 minutes walk to Bond Street Tube station. The stay was incredible and definitely an experience to stay there. The only reason why it didn't get a 5 star is the warm welcome that I did not get. Everyone seemed cold towards my party and didn't offer to help in any upon check-in. Until it was our turn to check-in only things started to get better. Once in a lifetime experience.
2390,Claridge's,A fantastic experience - as always - made to feel like Royalty with all aspects being to the highest standard. The room upgrade was a lovely surprise on check-in. Restaurant and in-room dining were sublime. Can not recommend highly enough.
2391,Claridge's,"Our stay at Claridge's was simply the best weekend away me, my wife and my little boy have ever experienced, we have stayed in some of the world’s finest hotels and Claridge's trumps them all, right from the hotel’s attention to detail to the food we ate. But most importantly the staff, Claridge's staff are true professionals, right from booking, to check in to leaving and everything in-between. How they put so much effort into making sure my little boy was looked after, we arrive to be greeted with a Claridge's teddy, with my son’s name on it, Amazing.... Then the room had not just lovely touches for me and my wife's wedding anniversary but special touches for Mason, a tiny little bath robe, a bath set, beautiful child friendly bath products. simply amazing. I would love to…"
2392,Claridge's,"Go for the hotel and its location, return for its staff and level of service. Every member of staff may just feel like we were the only guest. The new rooms are beautiful and spacious, the stay exceeded our expectations."
2393,Claridge's,"I have stayed at Claridge's and the other top hotels in London many times. Since the recent renovations and addition of a swimming pool Claridge's is now the best hotel in London. The service is truly outstanding, the rooms have been redone and are in pristine condition, and the food is outstanding at breakfast. We look forward to our next visit."
2394,Claridge's,"Claridges is nicely situated on a quiet street in Mayfair centrally located to the bustle of London. Easy transportation access and walkable distances to many sights, tourist and shopping. The hotel is in a quiet area of traffic but the hotel itself was very busy during our stay especially the Foyer and Reading Room for tea. If you plan to stay at a well established 5 star hotel I just cannot think of a better location."
2395,Claridge's,"The experience was truly magnificent! I commend each and every individual I encountered, as well as those who worked behind the scenes, for making my stay exceptional. Well done! I was traveling with my business colleagues, and I must say that we were all ecstatic. Leaving was so difficult, but I will continue to share my glowing reviews and look forward to returning soon. You have captured my heart. ❤️"
2396,Claridge's,The Rooms are exquisitely decorated as is the pool. The staff are amongst the best we've encountered especially the doormen and lovely French lady on reception. The hotel is beautiful and quintessentially British and a must stay once in a lifetime. Little touches that other hotels do like water in the car for the journey back are sadly missing. The main reason why we couldn't give 5 stars is the repeated inadequate staff ratios. At dinner it was always a long wait to get another glass of coke and at one of the bars after dinner we just gave up and went to bed. At the best establishments when your glass is 3/4 empty the attentive staff will offer another one. The food was nice but not world class no expansive menu outside of the UK. The hotel just seems too busy too much of a…
2397,Claridge's,Well we’re do I start - we were staying at the Langham and had a bad experience and left hotel at 4am … called Claridges they were fully booked but told us come and we will organise something for you so my husband and I turned up and from the moment we arrived looking ‘not our best’ in the early hours we were welcomed like an old fashioned ‘Inn’ feed/watered and given a comfy place to wait whilst they worked there ‘Claridges’ magic and after tea/juice and a hearty breakfast we were given a room (with a free upgrade due to our stressful night which was nothing to do with Claridges) by 9am! Claridges didn’t even charge us for a check in 6 hours early. The rest of our 2 day stay was fault - Yes it’s a stunning hotel But what makes this hotel special is the Team who all have a…
2398,Claridge's,"Our experience was mixed. Really nice room, but TV on the edge of reception, cold shower for the 1st two mornings (we told reception each morning) and a shower that shed water all over the bathroom floor (not good for the little slippers they provide). Great evening meal with excellent service and excellent service in the bar for food, but the hot food at brekfast (cold food pastries etc were excellent) left a lot to be desired. At one point my wifes comment was 'our local garden centre does better than this'. Overall given the seemig hype about this hotel we were a little dissapointed. We won't be returning. There are better places in London."
2399,Claridge's,"On 21 April 2023, my mum and I had cocktails in the bar at Claridge's, followed by pink champagne afternoon tea. It's been a very long time since I've experienced such exceptional customer service. The servers in the Foyer were so welcoming and attentive. I believe we were served by Donal, who was amazing. I loved talking to everyone. We went home with an amazing package of goodies ... thank you so much to the pastry chef for sending us home with the most exquisite pistachio pasties! I also have to mention the two ladies in the powder room ... so lovely to chat to, and they were so helpful. Thank you, to the Claridge's team for making a beautiful memory for both my mum and I."
2400,"The Bird, Bath","Very nice and clean. Highly recommend the afternoon tea on the patio, very pretty outdoor area. We only had one night would have been fun to have a few spent more days in Bath. So much to explore. No internet in bedroom was a little inconvenient."
2401,"The Bird, Bath","A surprise issue with the restaurant experience on our first night. This was handled well by the Assistant Manager and subsequently by the Reservations Manager. That aside, it was I believe not the usual experience and overall I would highly recommend the hotel. We had a lovely room which was very clean and comfortable and the location is superb for seeing the sights of Bath easily on foot. Staff members are both friendly and welcoming."
2402,"The Bird, Bath","Great find, great location. Staff are wonderful and the restaurant and bar are amazing. Love the quirkiness and the decor. Only tiny negative is a dated wardrobe in the bedroom but everything else outshines that. Brilliant and will return!"
2403,"The Bird, Bath",This hotel is double the normal going rate with nothing to offer that warranties the price. It is advertised as dog friendly with no green space near to the hotel. The rooms are super small for a couple and a dog it is impossible to feel at ease. Would not recommend.
2404,"The Bird, Bath","Our stay was incredible. From the moment we checked in, there were quirky little details and art at every turn. We felt welcomed and were very impressed by the accommodations. We would recommend to friends and family and we will definitely stay here again if we get back to Bath."
2405,"The Bird, Bath","The team at The Bird were wonderful. I was made to feel very welcome. My dog was also very well looked after. The food is excellent, the cocktails were great. I look forward to my next stay and would highly recommend The Bird to anyone visiting Bath."
2406,"The Bird, Bath","At The Bird you meet nice people, The place is very nice with restaurant, so you can have lunch and/or dinner inside the hotel and the food is very good. It’s cleaned and well furnished. You can use the car park and the hotel is 5 minute walking from the city centre and 5 minutes by car from Bath university. Nice place to have a pre-dinner cocktail open air."
2407,"The Bird, Bath","This hotel, besides having a great location, very nice rooms, beautiful decor, has an amazing staff, that made our stay one to remember. They are very welcoming, helpful, and attentive to details. I would recommend this hotel for anyone traveling to Bath."
2408,"The Bird, Bath","Really lovely hotel - from the decor, food, ambience and staff, we could not fault our stay. Great location being just a short walk into the centre of Bath and a real bonus to be able to park on site too. We stayed in room 28 which had super comfy beds and great roll top bath and walk in shower, but it was quite warm at night, but that didn't affect our enjoyment of our stay. A big thank you to Sam for making us fun cocktails and all the staff for their friendliness and willing to go the extra mile."
2409,"The Bird, Bath","This hotel is very well located has mostly attentive friendly staff. Parking is £20 per night which is a first time we have been charged to park at a hotel. Breakfast is excellent. Dinner was lacking quality. Room was very hot, no aircon in this hotel."
2410,"The Bird, Bath","Only 1/2 mile to the Roman Baths and many excellent restaurants. High ceilings, large windows, modern bathrooms, but only 1/2 the rooms have air conditioning. If you’re traveling May /September, make sure you get a room with A/C. Good breakfasts, nice terrace and bar."
2411,"The Bird, Bath","Had the most fabulous stay at The Bird in Bath. From the moment we parked up we were treated as returning guests. The hotel is just beautiful - interior has been beautifully curated by the owners. My little dog was treated like a VIP with her own welcome pack :-) 3 Members of staff who were fabulous were Christopher who welcomed us and served drinks - so amazingly friendly and so sweet to my children, the lovely man who served us dinner - I think he might have been doing a masters course (?!) who was efficient and lovely and the wonderful lady who served us breakfast in the morning- please tell her that Freddie came 10th in the country at his triathlon! She was so sweet. Honestly I was blown away by the room, the service and the hotel and I am really really hard to please! I am…"
2412,"The Bird, Bath","An excellent dog friendly hotel, only a few minutes walk to the centre of Bath. Please note that they do not have a lift/elevator so if you have a large senior dog it's best to specify the lower ground floor."
2413,"The Bird, Bath","I was nervous about travelling with my dog, but this place was so welcoming to my friend and I as well as my dog! There is a wow moment around every corner, and the staff is a total delight! Wonderful!"
2414,"The Bird, Bath",We stayed for our anniversary with our dog and children. It is perfectly positioned for the canal and central Bath. The courtyard is stunning with heaters. Cocktails and food are well made and the restaurant isn’t too busy.
2415,"The Bird, Bath","What a lovely place to stay with beautiful unique decor, lovely rooms with a view and fantastic staff. The new garden is great too for a daytime meal or evening drink. Breakfast served fresh and again the staff were really friendly and helpful. Will def be returning"
2416,"The Bird, Bath","From the minute we arrived we were made to feel really welcome. The decor is stunning. Our room was beautifully decorated. Without exception the staff were warm, friendly and attentive. The hotel is situated very close to Bath centre. Parking at the hotel is a plus also."
2417,"The Bird, Bath","We stayed in a comfy double. We loved the hotel's decor - quite funky with great artwork. The staff were very pleasant and welcoming. Only a 10 - 15 minute walk to the city centre, so very good location. Bedroom far too small - 'comfy' is misleading."
2418,"The Bird, Bath",Excellent hotel. The room was spacious and well appointed. You could spend a day just admiring the original art on display. The quality of the restaurant was such that we didn't need to leave the hotel for meals. Friendly and helpful staff. Couldn't fault this hotel in any way and would definitely recommend.
2419,"The Bird, Bath","This is our go-to-hotel in Bath! We love everything about it and the staff just make it come to life: what a brilliant team and wonderful atmosphere, always. It's quirky, fun and all the little touches just make it a very special place."
2420,"The Bird, Bath",Loved everything about this hotel. Breakfast freshly cooked and was served to your table. Lots of little extras which made a homely feel. Quiet bedrooms so slept well and we were at the front by main road! My bestie and I had a cosy double room each and it was perfect! Easy to walk to centre of Bath from The Bird! Staff so welcoming and friendly. We had the perfect stay! Thoroughly recommend!
2421,"The Bird, Bath","The Bird is great - this was our second stay and doubt if it will be our last. Just love its quirky, friendly atmosphere. It also has great service and exceptional staff. The rooms are comfy and well furnished - continuing the quirky theme. The food is also excellent."
2422,"The Bird, Bath","It would be hard to beat such a great location, character hotel and staff with high standards and a friendly attitude. The room and bathroom were clean and attractively refurbished and the shower pressure was super. Parking is a real asset."
2423,"The Bird, Bath","We stayed as joint celebration for our birthdays and really loved the hotel. All the staff were lovely and helpful, the hotel was unique with fab decorations and the little touches like freshly baked cookies on departure made it even better! Would definitely stay again"
2424,"The Bird, Bath",An excellent Hotel in a good location. It is within a convenient walking distance of all the major tourist attractions. Caroline and the young helpful Staff in the Restaurant helped to make our visit an extra special occasion.
2425,"The Bird, Bath","My second visit to The Bird, fab location and everything in walking distance. Lovely welcoming staff. Great breakfast with plenty of choice. A must visit when in Bath I will definitely be going again very soon!"
2426,"The Bird, Bath","I travel a lot for work and I like to find places that are a bit different to the chain hotels and gastro-pubs usually on offer. The Bird looked great and the prices were very respectable. Upon arrival I was welcomed by Howard- very helpful and professional. The hotel lobby is very tastefully decorated and is both cosy and contemporary. I was shown where I could find the fridge with fresh milk for my room if required, and the free snack cupboard in case i needed popcorn or chewy sweets! I stayed in a Dinky-Double; which is as it sounds. A small room with double bed, small desk, and ensuite. It was perfect for an overnight stay. The food in the beautiful restaurant was top class too and the staff extremely friendly. Overall it was a lovely stay and I reckon i'll be looking in…"
2427,"The Bird, Bath","lovely decorated hotel with nice and friendly staff. The room is bit small but it is tiday and clean.The breakfast is really outstanding and highly recommended . We had a really enjoyable trip while staying in this hotel. Therefore, we will definitely comeback again."
2428,"The Bird, Bath","The Bird is a very quaint, quirky hotel. My room was lovely and the birthday card/notes a noteworthy touch. However I did feel let down with my breakfast. Although I previously advised the hotel and double checked prior to my stay my dietary requirements, there were no non diary yogurts available. I asked for a banana and was told there was one already on my porridge. Not eating apples or citrus fruits my choice was limited. Breakfast on my first day took 90 minutes. I’m all for a leisurely breakfast, that was too long, and so had to rush for a planned trip which wasn’t good. After mentioning this to the receptionist, it was rectified the following day. I paid a lot of money for my stay and was advised on the day of my departure to give notice of any dietary requirements, as…"
2429,"The Bird, Bath",Lovely dog and child friendly hotel! Really funky decor and an unbeatable location. The spa bath in the Deluxe Double is the best bath ever!! Staff super friendly and welcoming. Gorgeous terrace and bar. Please note sleep quality only marked down for my children who struggled to sleep on a fold down bed with uncomfortable metal bars. But the main bed was very comfy.
2430,"The Bird, Bath","An overnight stay for us & our dog Daisy. Surpassed our expectations. Beautiful hotel - we stayed in dog friendly Abbey King Room, great location for exploring Bath & superb breakfast. The real highlight that helps set this hotel apart is the team that work there, got a real sense that they genuinely love their jobs, are all super friendly and can’t do enough to help. Lots of little extra touches & Daisy was treated like royalty! We will definitely be back & wouldn’t hesitate to bring our 8yr old daughter next time too. Thank you for a lovely 24hrs in Bath :)"
2431,"The Bird, Bath","Will for sure be back to stay , lovely hotel & staff , a great weekend had at The Bird Hotel , the hotel is just what you need for a chilled weekend away , lovely staff , lovey decor , service , cleanliness , location ,"
2432,"The Bird, Bath","Really enjoyed how friendly the staff were, the quirkiness of the hotel, the lovely room and beautiful breakfast we had. Also it's in a great location, so whether you want to walk in or take a short uber ride, it won't take long to get into town. Also, parking on location is great, but would have been nice to have it more forewarned about the £20 charge for the night...PRICEY!"
2433,"The Bird, Bath",We had a slight noise issue with out room however the staff were really apologetic even though it was not their fault & gave us another room without hesitation. Amazing food. Amazing location and amazing hotel. They have lovely little treats like a snack section where you can get free snacks and drinks & a little gift when you leave.
2434,"The Bird, Bath",I’d highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to stay in Bath. Everything from the friendly and welcoming team to the spacious rooms with amazing views to having parking available onsite (£20 a night which is reasonable given the location) and being in such an accessible location - you’re no more than ten minutes away from most of the main sites in Bath. And the complimentary snack bar downstairs is a real winner. Haven’t seen that anywhere else and it was greatly appreciated! Couldn’t have asked for a experience.
2435,"The Bird, Bath","Visited as a group of five friends for afternoon tea. As it was over the Coronation weekend they had a special menu on for the occasion. Great selection of sweet and savoury items, freshly made and all very delicious. We were very well looked after by all the staff. Fab decor and was very clean. Thank you!"
2436,"The Bird, Bath","Never felt more welcomed anywhere. Exceptional staff, always eager to help. Very stylish, yet comfortable. The best food and service in the restaurant and bar. Great location. Walking distance to Bath centre. Overall, a fabulous stay."
2437,"The Bird, Bath","I booked through a Virgin Experience Voucher. Chose for location Only negatives for us though only smallish niggles are that we didn't expect so many dogs. I like dogs but don't want them barking when having breakfast. The shelf holding the tea and coffee didn't seem secure and tilted forwards meaning things fell off. Very small room. If it was me I would probably use the table as you came in the door for the tea and coffee so that a chair could be placed in the room (room 11) Lots of stairs, some very shallow but then it is an old house"
2438,"The Bird, Bath",Stayed here on a Sunday evening. Relaxed atmosphere. Warm welcome. Great location. Dogs are accepted but I hadn’t realised how many would be there. Unfortunately we were forgotten for breakfast and had to wait up to an hour before our cooked breakfast arrived. Also I was surprised at being charged £20 as a guest to park my car for the night - factor this in. The Bird are trying to emulate 15 Great Pulteney Street hotel who really do have quirky nailed and have a superior tuck shop 🙂
2439,"The Bird, Bath",As we have a client in the area we need a base that’s home from home and The Bird is the one for us. Far from a chain without a soul the owners allow their team to be authentic whilst aiming for excellent service. We love the quirky but considered decor. Whilst it should be a given for all hotels but it’s not- the beds are so comfy it’s a bit tricky to get up in the morning! The excellent breakfast makes it worthwhile.
2440,"The Bird, Bath",Clean spacious rooms and friendly staff. The location is great with an easy walk into town to see the many wonders of Bath. On-site parking makes this an ideal location if you are traveling by automobile.
2441,"The Bird, Bath","From the moment we entered, Howard at the desk received us with a very warm welcome. He quickly gave us the lowdown on the city, took our bags to the room and off we went. Comfortable rooms with modern en-suite. Great breakfast and bar/restaurant. All in all highly recommend."
2442,"The Bird, Bath","The Bird is a lovely, quirkly hotel exactly the right distance from the centre of town and run by very frienly staff - highly recommend We have a one year old who was very well looked after, nothing was too much trouble. Great advice on things to do and places to see locally"
2443,"The Bird, Bath",Quirky and colourful in a good way. Very comfortable bedroom - good quality bedding; towels. All staff were very friendly. Nice touches such as complementary soft drinks; fruit etc..Good choice at breakfast.
2444,"The Bird, Bath","We had a wonderful stay at The Bird in Bath. It was our first time visiting Bath after spending 5 days in London. The location was perfect. We often walked to the main area for dining or shopping or if we were tired, an uber was always quickly available. The decor in the property was so unique, we enjoyed that. We opted to get the breakfast package and that was well worth it. I would highly recommend this place for your lodging needs."
2445,"The Bird, Bath","Really lovely staff, they were all super friendly and very happy to help you out. Hotel is within walk-able distance to all the main sites in Bath but in a nice quite location. Lots of complimentary snacks which we love :)"
2446,"The Bird, Bath","We slept there for 3 nights. Nice location which permitted to visit Bath without car. Decorated with care. Coffee, tea ... in room, nice bathroom. Perfect team. Very good breakfasts and dinner. Thank you. Greetings from France."
2447,"The Bird, Bath","Just returned from a lovely weekend at the Bird, Bath. This boutique hotel is excellent. The staff are extremely attentive (we were looked after very well by Harmony) and the rooms were perfect. Breakfast is also highly recommended it was fantastic."
2448,"The Bird, Bath","We arranged our visit to the Bird on recommendation from close friends who have extremely high standards and a great sense of fun. We were impressed from the onset. Our room was beautifully furnished, comfortable and with great views. We were made very welcome by the lovely team of staff"
2449,"The Bird, Bath","The hotel is in a great location just a 10 minute walk from the touristy areas, and the staff was very friendly and gets high marks. Kudos to Caroline and Victoria for being very helpful, especially given our obvious dissatisfaction with a few things. Our big observation is that whoever is managing the hotel has obviously focused on the frills and extras and overlooked things that matter much more. They have a station with free candy and soda and provided us with a free box of snacks for our dog, but the two rooms they gave us both had significant problems. The first was actually outside the hotel and build as an add-on. It felt like we were staying in a trailer next to the hotel instead of a nice hotel room. It was literally right outside the back door of the bar and among…"
2450,Craig Y Don,"Another fantastic week staying here. This hotel is an absolute fabulous gem. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the evening entertainment is brilliant and quite a variety to suit all guests. Breakfast and evening meals are lovely and plenty of choices All the staff are very welcoming Special shout outs must go to: Mel & Adam - Housekeeping, your team are great at keeping all of the bedrooms spotless and replenishing tea/coffee etc Bar Team - Stefan, Nick & Franco - just all round great guys Restaurant - Anna is fantastic at running a good team, always making sure the guests are looked after and making sure her team are on top of clearing tables etc. Danny for making sure I had lovely soft poached eggs every morning The wonderful Mr Craig Y Don - Neil. You always have a…"
2451,Craig Y Don,"Just got back from a week at this outstanding hotel. We have stayed here a number of times now and it never fails to impress. The Location is ideal. As others have mentioned, it is only a short walk to central pier and also the town centre. The buffet breakfast and Three course evening meals were delicious. What sets this hotel above all others is the staff. From Housekeeping, dining room staff, bar staff, front of house staff, they all go above and beyond to make sure you have the best holiday ever. A big shout out to Nick who provided extra entertainment on Bank Holiday Monday by completing the Ice Bucket Challenge in front of the hotel. Amazing hotel at amazing prices. Can't wait to come back in September"
2452,Craig Y Don,"Our trip to the Craig Y Don was arranged and booked well in advance due to my husbands disability needs, I was told over the phone wet rooms and accessible entry would be no problem , so I paid £680 for a twin sea view room for a week 20th-27th May. We arrived a walked into reception to be told no ramp access only steps up to front of hotel, but if we drove round to the back of the hotel my husband could come and go from the fire exit door at the back of the dining room. My son took the car around the back of the hotel the path was was just an uneven back alley, my son then started helping me up the room with suitcases and things only to be told move your car,my son asked the duty manager if he could keep an eye on his young daughter whilst moving the car as I was up in the…"
2453,Craig Y Don,Craig y don remains our go to hotel in Blackpool. We have stayed here at least 6 times and enjoyed each and every time. Without exception the staff are always friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The food is always tasty and plentiful. The entertainment is always enjoyable. Our main waitress this time was Sara who was helpful and attentive. Once again we will leave the hotel looking forward to the next stay.
2454,Craig Y Don,"Craig y don never disappoints. Excellent service from all staff, this has been our 6th stay, and we’ve had a wonderful time. Evening entertainment has been up to the usual standard. Always feel safe and comfortable here. Well don’t be Craig y don !"
2455,Craig Y Don,"Good hotel, nice room, good food, good staff, enjoyable bingo, will book again , scooter hire spot on, beach front, just my cup of tea, lift access great for me , the evening acts were great and put great effort into the songs"
2456,Craig Y Don,"We have just returned from another stay at the Craig-y-Don, staying again in a Double Sea View Room, which was lovely, fresh and modern. We choose the option to add the evening meal to our stay. The food is always nice with a good choice on offer and served in their large dining room/restaurant which like the rest of the hotel is decorated to a good standard. What sets the Craig-y-Don apart from other hotels we have stayed in is the amazing staff, who are committed to giving the guests the best stay. A big thank you to each and everyone one of them, in particular Daniel, Sara and Anna in the Restaurant, Monika from Housekeeping who looked after our room. Barbara, Amanda, Tim, Neil and Laura from Reception/Management team and Francisco in the Bar. Entertainment wise the drag…"
2457,Craig Y Don,"I have just returned from a 10 day stay at the craig y don.i have stayed there several times before,as I believe this hotel to be the best in blackpool and nothing during this stay has made me change my mind. On arrival the reception staff were friendly and helpful. The bar staff were always very cheerful,and I very much enjoyed the evening entertainment. I only booked b and b so I cannot comment on the evening meal ,but I really enjoyed the breakfast, and the restaurant staff were excellent. A particular thanks to the housekeeping staff ; My room was serviced every day,in stark contrast to when I stayed at another hotel,where my room was serviced just twice in a week.i will not name and shame the hotel suffice it to say it is extremely close to the craig y don.in addition to…"
2458,Craig Y Don,"Second visit now, absolutely brilliant in all areas. Clean, welcoming and run very professionally. I must mention Franco, Nick and the chef for going above and beyond due to my disability. Definitely recommend x"

2461,Craig Y Don,My first trip to Blackpool was especially pleasant due to the friendliness of the staff in this hotel. On my final morning I had to leave early and several staff ensured that I received a cooked breakfast before my departure.
2462,Craig Y Don,"We stayed here in May. As always we enjoyed out stay; great staff and entertainment. Excellent service from Sara in the restaurant along with Ana, and Stefan in the bar/reception. Would highly recommend this hotel."
2463,Craig Y Don,"We had the Craig Y Don booked for our U9 and U10 football tournament over the May weekend. Place was very welcoming as soon as we entered, even if it was to ask where the best parking was a few hours before our check in time. Once the check in was complete, went up to the room. We had a room for 4 - a double and 2 singles. Room was clean, tidy, really comfortable, and really spacious. Good selection of drinks at the bar, both alcoholic and non alcoholic, and also really reasonably priced. Beds were comfortable as well. Breakfast in the mornings were brilliant. Good selection of cooked breakfast items, cereals, fruit and yogurts. On our 2nd night my son unfortunately got unwell due to some food at another establishment, and the room needed a bit of TLC. The staff went over and…"
2464,Craig Y Don,"We had a fabulous, time as always at CYD all the staff are fantastic.v We’ve been there a few times before and it certainly won’t be our last either as we are currently planning our next two trips, this year to the CYD. The hotel is spotlessly clean and comfortable, high praise to the cleaning staff. The restaurant staff, Keith, Ell and Daniel are totally fantastic. They can’t do enough for you can’t thank them enough for making meal time enjoyable with their banter. See you soon guys."
2465,Craig Y Don,"Just on way back from our stay as a coach of ladies who have had the best weekend in Blackpool at the Craigy y don hotel we are first timers at the hotel and certainly wont be our last, central location,outside well maintained reception staff lovely , friendly bar staff kitchen staff were all absolutely amazing rooms are spotless the hotel overall is well looked after all staff helpful nothing is a bother food was lovely and fab entertainment especially Anthony on sunday night outstanding look forward to our next stay"

2467,Craig Y Don,"I am a 73 year old disabled pensioner with cancer, I wanted to stay on the sea front in Blackpool after looking at the amenities at Craig y don I checked access for my wheelchair,in the question section on the booking.com web site someone asked about bringing a wheelchair and the hotel replied it had a ramp at the back of the hotel.,on arrival I was sent round the back down a small alleyway to the back of the hotel to. be told by the receptionist that there wasn’t a ramp there was a small lift,but it wasn’t advisable to come round the back of a night and there is no guarantee that there would be a member of staff to open the back door,so we should come in before dark.as I had booked to go to a show I would not be in before dark.so I decided to go and book somewhere else.the…"
2468,Craig Y Don,"Pros- Hotel is clean. Location is perfect. Rooms cosy and comfortable. Breakfast was really good. Most staff were friendly. Cons- Very noisy! You can hear everything going on in rooms around you. We were looking forward to the nightly entertainment but it was always to busy to get a seat. They allow people that are not guests to watch the entertainment, unless you sit at a table hours before it starts then you can't get a seat. Not great for paying guests."
2469,Craig Y Don,This hotel is the best we have ever stayed in. All the staff can’t do enough for you. Check in/ out very good. Food was excellent and Anna our waitress was very helpful. Bar staff were excellent and Neil the compare made the evenings with his jokes and comments when playing bingo. Every evening the cabaret was brilliant must have to say Bonnie le blue was our favourite. We have had an excellent break and will definitely be back.
2470,Craig Y Don,"Stayed here,Monday to Friday.Lovely friendly wellcome with Amanda.We had a beautiful spacious family room,spotless with nice comfy beds.The meals were lovely,and plenty of them.Keith and Dan in the dining room where so lovely and friendly, and Keith gave us chocolates every day.They all made us feel so wellcome.The entertainment was brilliant every night,and Neil was good fun with the Bingo.We won 3 nights so even better.Staff are so friendly and polite, and cant do enough for you.This is our 3rd visit, and we can't wait to go back."
2471,Craig Y Don,"Great time away for a five day break at the Craig-Y-Don hotel last week. Good food, clean rooms and good entertainment as well as great service especially Keith. Will definitely return. Already looking at other dates. Thanks all."
2472,Craig Y Don,"Just returned from the Craig-Y-Don from a 4 day break and as usual it was perfect. We have stayed here many times before over the years and every stay is better than the last time. The staff are excellent and they all go the extra mile to make you feel like one of the family. The girls and boys in the restaurant are excellent especially Keith what a lovely man always jolly and so very helpful, if there were any fault at all with the staff there was a man who served at breakfast and he also worked the bar, he could maybe have a smile every now and then it would be appreciated, but he did not spoil our review of the hotel. Neil on reception and the girls are super helpful you could ask them anything. We had a lovely room very spacious and lovely and warm, The food is absolutely…"
2473,Craig Y Don,"This is a lovely place to stay, centrally located with tram stop right outside. Comfortable rooms and great breakfast. Entertainment was fun with nightly bingo. All staff bar none were very helpful and friendly. Will definitely stay again on next visit to blackpool"
2474,Craig Y Don,"We were here a couple of weeks ago, with friends and as usual we had a fantastic time , as always Neil and all the staff are amazing, they make your holiday just brilliant and a special mention to Keith and all the staff in the restaurant, they go out of their way to help you, our friends loved their holiday with you and will be booking another holiday, with you , my wife and I will be coming back in July, can't wait to come back to the Craig y Don ,been coming here for along time now, Breaks 2 Go are a great company to book your holiday with, Ally and Liz Martin, well done guys."
2475,Craig Y Don,"Excellent value for money. Nice room - albeit rather cold at times - but then again, the outdoor temperature was very low and the weather inclement! Friendly staff, especially Stacey and Keith in the dining room."
2476,Craig Y Don,"Best hotel I’ve stayed in Blackpool. Lovely and clean, great breakfast and entertainment. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Can’t fault a thing we had a brilliant stay. Central to everything and tram stop right outside."
2477,Craig Y Don,Just had another fabulous holiday at Craig Y Don Hotel Blackpool from 7th till 14th April All staff were brilliant and cannot do enough for you. Neil Amanda Ben Daniel Stefan Fran Nick Anna Daniel Ell Keith and the entertainment was excellent all week especially Bonnie La Blue Antony Oliver Jason Stewart & Shirley and the Up Highs and all the other entertainers. Although it’s a family hotel and some people were up in arms regarding an entertainer but it’s up to the parents to make a decision whether their kids watch it or not and it’s well emphasised what type a show it is
2478,Craig Y Don,Well I can say I thought the hotel was very good . Clean great area . Food very good staff very friendly and attentive. Great lady Anna at the dining room . To be honest the staff lovely . Loved playing bingo even my 12 year old enjoyed it . Great laugh . Thanks again be back in the future. Well done you all . 👍🏻😁😁😁
2479,Craig Y Don,Once again the craig y don pulled out all the stops to provide a brilliant easter weekend. Neil made sure that every customer felt special. The restaurant staff Anna and Dan that were on our table were well catered for and the Restaurant Manager Keith made everyone feel special. All the bar staff were absolutely brilliant and Nick spent his 50th birthday with us all . Congratulations. We had a sea view room which was immaculate in both cleanliness and decor. if anyone is thinking of giving them a try I would be amazed if they found any fault with anything. Thank you all for making our stay memorable for all the right reasons. Ruth and kevin

2482,Craig Y Don,"Stayed here on 4th until 7th of April , had room 34, 63 Walked in with a warm welcome by the lady Had to go and find a car park 1 mile away for 15 per day which is ok so it a negative point about this hotel Breakfast was lovely eggs are beautiful / 8.30 until 9.30 My mom is disabled and this hotel doesn’t cater for her and she doesn’t feel welcomed because there is no ramp for her wheelchair or scooter my dad has to lift the scooter up some stairs and it a pain my mom doesn’t feel welcomed in this hotel if you have a pram or a wheelchair or scooter you are no good in this hotel and there is a lot of stairs outside The rooms was clean and tidy lifts for all floor Staff is very nice and friendly and lovely people Entertainment was great drag queen was amazing and…"
2483,Craig Y Don,"Located on the promenade with tram stops right out side the hotel. Free parking just round the back. The hotel is spotless, the food is good and the bar prices are reasonable. The staff cant do enough for you, all work very hard esp Nick on the bar keeping everyone hydrated with Beverages. Will be going back later on in the year.."
2484,Craig Y Don,"What a great hotel. The staff were very friendly and accommodating to our needs. We only booked for b&b as we was unsure what we would be doing in the evening. However for our final 2 nights we thought we would have dinner at the hotel. No hassle booking a table and well worth it. Had a good choice of options. The breakfast was also well catered for and thoroughly enjoyed them. Evening entertainment was good and really enjoyed the in house bingo. The hotel was only a couple of minutes walk to the tower and opposite a tram stop which was ideal. Although there is no parking at the hotel the road behind the hotel was free to stay the whole time we was there and never had a problem parking. Would I stay here again? Definitely, well worth the money and a superb location."
2485,Craig Y Don,"Great hotel and location. Staff are so friendly and helpful. Waiter Keith is so friendly and efficient. Rooms lovely and clean. Good food every night with a lot of choice. Caberet entertainment was enjoyable, great singers and Bingo was fun. Would return here if I came back to Blackpool."
2486,Craig Y Don,Had an amazing weekend hotel is very comfortable rooms are lovely . Staff are amazing cant fault anything will be back same time next year 🤞thanks Keith for our sweets 😀Actually even had lovely weather so
2487,Craig Y Don,After repeated visits I have to say we were greeted by staff as family from Neil at the door to all staff . Everything is fabulous clean . And organised . And just so welcoming . The food is first class . We certainly will be back .Keith always greets us with a huge welcome and the new little elf who greeted us at Xmas . Elle. But how can anyone not mention all staff they are all the best . They all deserve a mention
2488,Craig Y Don,What a lovely hotel staff so friendly food was very good the room we had was nice and quiet we have made a new friend in Keith he was a marvellous man nothing was to much for him keep up the good work Keith and all the staff at the Craig y Don will definitely be returning Mike & Sheila room 3
2489,Craig Y Don,Arrived on time but took a while to find a parking space as there is no car park. Parking is only available at the rear of the property on the main road so if that's full it may take you a while to find somewhere to park. I can only imagine that during peak season parking close by would be very difficult. I was a bit worried about staying here if I'm honest as the frontage isn't very appealing but once you get past the doors it's a very nice modern hotel. Getting in can be an issue if you have a disability as there are steps up to the main door and then once through the main door you have even more steps to deal with. I have a disability myself but I managed with a degree of difficulty but anyone with a more severe disability would have a problem. Not sure if there is an easier…
2490,Craig Y Don,"Was a great stay room was spotless, But thinking the dining needs to be reviewed, our party was 33 which over 30 older aged, and having to pour your own soup was definitely a bit risky, especially when staff are just walking about, same with having to get your tea/coffee, possibly having someone go round with a tea pot for atleast 1 cup would be helpfull, Apart from that entertainment was fabulous and had a great weekend, will definitely be returning"
2491,Craig Y Don,"keith NO.1 waiter!!!! lots of love mrs orchard and her friend margret at table 81 we had a really good time per usual, hope to see you all again. the rest of the staff were amazing! we will be back very very soon!! ❤️"
2492,Craig Y Don,"Have been several times now and it gets better every time. Food lovely and well cooked, staff very friendly especially Keith and Dan in dining room. Reception and barstaff friendly and helpful. Hotel spotless and nice and cosy! Entertainment good, especially Bonnie Ie Blue, a fabulous drag queen on Thursday night, I haven't laughed so hard in years. He is on every Thursday until November! Will be back soon!😂😂"
2493,Craig Y Don,"Everything was perfect, spent the 4 days with a group of school friends and we are all 60 this year,food was fantastic and staff couldn't do enough for us,will certainly be back asp. Hotel was spotless and rooms where comfortable. The hotel is in a central location and tram stops right outside hotel."
2494,Craig Y Don,"The staff here are amazing, honestly it's the best customer service I have experienced in a hotel. Thank you so much for making our stay so wonderful. A special shout out to Daniel who supplied the eye candy 🍬 keep up the good work 👏"

2500,The Bristol,First time staying at Bristol Hotel and the location is good and the beds in the room are so comfortable . The rooms are not large but have everything you need to have and you can open the window which is a bonus as you do not like having windows closed with air conditioning all the time. I had a bottle of wine and fruit in the room for me for my birthday which was a bonus! The bar and restaurant are good and in a relaxed position . The staff were pretty helpful on reception and I forgot my phone charger in the room but on contacting them it was returned to me which was greatly appreciated.
2501,The Bristol,The car park was quite tight and was unsure about paying. Only one lift working with max 4 people in at one time. Room lovely and cool. Great facilities. Very close to bars and restaurants. Service for drinks in the evening bar was great as was the service at reception.
2502,The Bristol,"The Receptionist Ana was so friendly. She checked in for us with a big smile. It's really nice and sweet for us since that day was so tiring from travelling all the way here. As in the room, it's spotless and elegant. We were so surprised and happy by the welcome plate and card from Cari. However, the next day morning, we were waken up by a housekeeping lady around 9 as she knocked the door. She did apologise so I believe it's just a mistake... Overall, I love the experience staying here and will definitely come back next time."
2503,The Bristol,"My room was spacious and comfortable. I especially enjoyed the views of the waterside and cityscape from my window. The relaxed atmosphere at the bar helped my colleagues and I wind down after a long day, getting to know new people and rekindling friendships. (I commend the hotel's stock of good quality rum, and a Scottish colleague was equally complimentary of your whiskey selection.) Breakfast was very pleasant with lots of choice and brilliant views of the Bristol waterside. I was there for the UKBA conference, which went without a hitch and the overwhelming feedback was “Wow!”. Everyone’s dietary requirements were well catered for, with a very tasty spread. Being gluten intolerant usually means I have to stay away from the nice stuff, but not this time ;-) …"
2504,The Bristol,"We have stayed at this hotel many times, & standards are always high. Lovely room overlooking the harbour side, & the breakfast is excellent, beautifully laid out with many choices. We also had dinner on our last night, special thanks to Joe & Michael for making our evening with their attention & friendliness.Also to housekeeping for making our room & hotel sparkle & smell nice ( especially to the lady polishing the glass in the lift) Looking forward a return visit. Thank you."
2505,The Bristol,"Loved this hotel. Right by the water. Lots of places to eat & drink. Room great, we stayed for 3 nights , hubby’s birthday so lovely complementary wine & fruit for us on arrival. Staff were all helpful & friendly. Car park right beside hotel & reasonably priced."
2506,The Bristol,"Excellent, friendly reception staff. Room was very clean, comfortable and stylish. The bed was extremely comfortable and the position is great for all the bars, restaurants and entertainment you could need."
2507,The Bristol,We have stayed here a few times but only recently have discovered the poor sound proofing. We spent the whole night disturbed by our neighbour coughing all night. A terrible night with no sleep. Cleaner then banging on door at 9am. Even though we had no sign on the door requesting cleaning. Apparently their systems don’t indicate to the cleaner who is staying or leaving. Needs sorting. Brief walk into the centre then returned to our room before checking out time to find cleaner had removed our belongings and was cleaning the room.
2508,The Bristol,We made a reasonably late notice booking as we decided to go o the Old Vic Bristol which is nearby. Our welcome was great from the reception team and all in the hotel. The room was large and accommodating and the bed was one of the comfiest I'd experienced in a long time. My job used to be running a very large travel business so I should know! Sa thanks to The Bristol for a very enjoyable 24 hours.
2509,The Bristol,Upgrade received and a complimentary half bottle of fizz in our room on arrival . Our hotel of choice when visiting Bristol due to location / car park and the friendly staff . A great new addition of Ricks cocktail bar.
2510,The Bristol,"Stayed here the night before my wife did the Bristol 10K. It’s in a great location and the car park is next door attached to the hotel. It was £14 for parking. Due to the run the road outside the hotel was closed until 3pm, but the hotel offered us a complimentary late check out at 3pm. Room was lovely, although the pillows were a bit squidgy. Breakfast was nice, plenty of choice and good quality. Would recommend Ricks bar for a drink overlooking the river. All the bars were heaving, but we managed to get a table there. Prices were reasonable and the service was very good."
2511,The Bristol,"Great location, 2 mins from Quayside and all the bars and restaurants. Very friendly team and helpful on arrival. Discounted parking on site in the multi story. But, room was very small, tiny wardrobe. Very good shower and well set out bathroom. The bed was far too soft. We rolled together and neither of us slept well. Both had back ache in the morning due to such an extremely soft bed. When I reported to reception they just they were sorry to hear that. I wasn’t in the mood to push the point as we had a 300 mile drive to do. I wouldn’t stay here again, and that’s a shame as it is a lovely hotel but not those beds. Only one chair in the room and though it has a quality feel, it’s just disappointing."
2512,The Bristol,"Positives: excellent location, comfy bed. Negative: probably the smallest hotel room that I've ever stayed in and was generally cramped. Staff were not particularly friendly, particularly those on reception desk, they were clearly more interested in chatting to each other than giving us any information. Not sure if it's because we were a young couple or had booked with Avios or something, but felt the reception staff were looking down their nose at us. Breakfast wasn't included...which I would've thought was a given at a '4*' £100+ per night hotel. All in all not a great experience."
2513,The Bristol,"A hotel and staff that’s tryout Meg very hard - well done to the team. The hotel is okay, but the little touches and friendly staff make this a great place to stay - we will be beck. Well done team Bristol. We had drinks but no food, so can’t comment on that"
2514,The Bristol,"Me and my fiancée have stopped here 6 times now, the price just keeps going up every time, we used to get a decent package for a few years as we were regulars there, but I feel that this hotel as gone down hill since Brett left, we will still go to Bristol but will be finding other hotels to stay in which is a shame really."
2515,The Bristol,"Another thoroughly enjoyable overnight stay with breakfast at The Bristol Hotel. Very high standards throughout, from service, cleanliness of room, to great quality and choice of food & drinks. The Bristol is comfortable, staff are welcoming, pleasant and efficient."
2516,The Bristol,"Would not stay anywhere in Bristol except this Hotel 😀 ideally located, absolutely friendly, helpful staff and great service. Went for a special occasion and couldn't have chosen anywhere better. Thanks!"
2517,The Bristol,Booked for our Wedding anniversary weekend. We received a complimentary room upgrade with chocolates and a very nice half bottle of Rioja which was lovely. Accommodation and breakfast very good. Loved the pianist at breakfast on Easter Sunday. All staff extremely helpful and welcoming. Lovely stay. Oh and brilliant location next to the river
2518,The Bristol,"Friendly helpful service, comfortable room with great facilities. Fabulous location, parking next to hotel and can pay through the hotel. Relaxed atmosphere at the end of the day with a night cap and a little live chilled music."
2519,The Bristol,"A very quiet and cured hotel in the harbour of Bristol. When looking for hotels that are right next to the core of Bristol, The Bristol Hotel is surely worth a mention. Part of The Doyle Collection, in this hotel you will find very kind and ready staff, cured rooms (even if not perfect). Things I liked: - Very kind and ready staff. They are there at any time to answer your questions and provide you with all the services you require. They might even surprise you sometimes, especially if you are a frequent guest. - Ambience. The ambience is very cured and the lounge that connects to The Harbourside gives you that perfect vibe to enjoy a drink from the also present cocktail bar. The beautiful restaurant is easily accessible and allows for elegante dinners with harbour view. …"
2520,The Bristol,"Fantastic from check in to check out Beautifully decorated Spotlessly clean and comfortable Right in the harbour side and walking distance of this lovely,vibrant city Special thanks to Nacho who was very helpful at check in Definitely recommend"
2521,The Bristol,A fantastic hotel. With beautiful decor and attentive staff. We were staying for a celebration and the hotel went the extra mile. With wine and chocolates in our harbour view room. Will definitely stay again. Breakfast was very tasty and relaxed. Pianist in the evening was a nice touch.
2522,The Bristol,"This is a great hotel for anyone working in the centre of Bristol. Lovely morning views from the breakfast restaurant overlooking the river and local boats, and the food offering was really nice. A particular mention to the front of house lady at the restaurant this morning (6th April) as she was lovely and extremely welcoming. The rooms are nice and include lovely Temple Spa products for visitors. Front desk staff are very welcoming and helpful, as are all the other staff I came across. My only minor criticism is the bar is quite expensive. I had a cheeky double whisky before bed and it was £22! Other than though, a great place to stay."
2523,The Bristol,"A touch expensive and rooms slightly tired, but staff great and intelligent though procedures don't scale well when there is a rush. Breakfast was delicious. After a couple of days we discovered ""secret"" doors leading from the hotel into the car park to save us going out through the lobby and back into the car park."
2524,The Bristol,"Highly recommended. Lovely experience, amazing and attentive staff who go above and beyond. Can't wait for my next visit. The only thing I would change is that I would ask for a room overlooking the river."
2525,The Bristol,"Excellent Hotel, staff very friendly. Room and bathroom very clean. Bed very comfortable. Great location next to the riverside with all the bars and restaunts in walking distance.Will be visiting again."
2526,The Bristol,"A very central location on the Harbourside but marred by poor attention to detail. The car park next door means that you have to lug your bags down flights of stairs to get to reception. Better to check in first then retrieve your luggage. Our room on the top floor was very nice with a great view. The breakfast on Sunday morning, admittedly probably the busiest time of the week was very poor, no fried eggs, beans, sausages , my coffee arrived as a jug of hot water but was quickly replaced by the charming waitress. In the bar there was a delay apparently waiting for wine glasses and typically, they had run out of the cheapest wine on the menu! In the River Grille which was so full of promise, mediocre food was served with great aplomb. That’s a common theme at the Bristol, lots…"
2527,The Bristol,"I came to the Bristol hotel’s conference centre for an Easter ball with my university peers, and I must say the atmosphere was amazing and everything was perfectly executed. I would like to especially thank the bartender Leah who took care of all of our drunken orders and was always patient as well as being a great person to chat to. I cannot remember the other bartenders name but shoutout to him too. Thanks again for the amazing experience, UoB Aerosoc society."
2528,The Bristol,There was not a lot of choice of the fixed food for the conference for vegetarians especially of Asian origin. The food was so bland no taste. There should be an option from the main menu rather than fixed menu.
2529,The Bristol,"A great location on the harbour side with the city centre, university, museum and cathedral all within easy walking distance. All the staff we came across were professional and friendly. The bedroom was clean and quite large, as was our bathroom. The room was well furnished, had tea/coffee making facilities, iron, safe and hairdryer and the toiletries in the bathroom were good quality. If you are a light sleeper then consider this when booking and ask for a room that does not overlook the waterside. We didn’t and the noise from the local nightlife went on until about 2am both nights. It’s not the hotel’s fault but perhaps, when finances allow, better sound-proofed windows this side of the building might help. The bed was very comfortable as was the room temperature. …"
2530,The Bristol,"Our experience was positive from the moment we checked in, through to checking out with the same member of staff (consistency...). We had lunch in the bar, which was great, and then returned later in the evening and received a great welcome and really good service before retiring to a very nice room (which was a standard room)."
2531,The Bristol,Really great one night stay. Both rooms I've booked were upgraded free of charge at arrival and staff were very friendly. Breakfast delivered at one of the rooms at time with plenty of food. As part of checkout the tray charge Was removed. Overall really great experience and friendly staff. Will definitely stay again.
2532,The Bristol,"Hotel reception was nicely decorated. Very good location, near the city centre, University and water side. Room was clean and quite large. Car park can be accessed directly from within the hotel. Car near mine had had a window smashed overnight , so not sure how secure it is. Reception has free drinks and they gave us a macaroon for St Patrick’s day. I would stay here again."
2533,The Bristol,"Booked a one night stay, explored the city during the day and pre-decided to eat and drink in the hotel for the evening. Great decision, relaxed with great food, comfort and service. Very quiet and comfortable room, complimented with a great buffet waterside breakfast. See you soon!"
2534,The Bristol,I have returned to The Bristol Hotel on many occasions in the last 3 years. I can honestly say that their quality and value really shines and I always enjoy a pleasant and comfortable stay and leave happy.
2535,The Bristol,"From the minute we entered the hotel I felt welcomed, everyone is friendly and helpful. Our room was stunning and they even acknowledged my sisters birthday which was such a lovely touch. The hotel is clean, like super clean, smells divine everywhere and I honestly can't fault anything. Every staff member seemed genuinely happy. Make sure you book breakfast as the pastries are delicious and there was a piano playing when we had ours which was a lovely touch. I loved that they rang me the day before to check everything and even the lady I spoke to then was so nice. They have the option of an allergy set up in the room which you can choose at the point of booking which is so convenient to me. I am already looking for excuses to go back!! Fantastic hotel, alush nights sleep and…"
2536,The Bristol,"In a very good location. Staff were brilliant very happy and very helpful. Breakfast was great, has to be one of the best I've had in a hotel. Beds were very comfortable and loved the fact it was actually a double bed opposed to two singles pushed together. The bar was open past 11 so we were able to have a drink after being at a concert at the 02 academy which is within walking distance!"
2537,The Bristol,"I have never stayed in such a well run hotel with every single member of staff being a pleasure to deal with. Every facility offered was of an excellent standard and the location of the hotel was really good with river views. The room was very clean and then suite bathroom was a joy as everything worked i.e. good shower, taps, sink etc (from my experience most hotels fail to provide good working bathrooms). As a Director I would not hesitate to use the hotel for any future conferences and would actively encourage staff to stay there"
2538,The Bristol,Brilliant place to stay in central Bristol. Car park being next door a great thing as left car for the full weekend and staying at the hotel you don’t pay for parking. The staff made the whole experience a great place to stay. Thank you
2539,The Bristol,"Great hotel, was upgraded to a bigger room. room was fully equipped, toiletries also available Great location, right in the Centre, you can walk to all location, restaurants and bars near by. staff were very friendly. Parking is also great, right next door and very cheap for city parking."
2540,The Bristol,"The whole staff, Cari the Business Excellence manager, Myah, Zack, Nicole and Rochelle, made my partners and my anniversary a perfect night. Thank you so much for making us feel so special, 10/10 experience"
2541,The Bristol,"The overnight stay was ""spot on "" in all areas. I had a very friendly and warm welcome by the Receptionist, the bedroom was impeccably clean and well presented. In the morning, I was again greeted by another excellent member of the team a and the breakfast buffet was great. The location of the Hotel is perfect with a car park right next to Hotel. I would definitely recommend The Bristol when visiting Bristol."
2542,The Bristol,Well located. Clean and spacious standard rooms. The check in system was down on arrival but the desk staff were calm and efficient. Offered free parking and breakfast for inconvenience without any prompting.
2543,The Bristol,"We have spent many enjoyable weekends at The Bristol over recent years. This time we took advantage of an upgrade offer to a Junior Suite and wow what a worthwhile extravagance... Initial disappointment that it did not have the river view of choice, we were so glad we decided to accept it but will not find it difficult to return to our usual rooms. The room was exceptionally quiet, As usual the staff are warm, friendly, professional and welcoming and the room service back to exceptional including small details like the turn back of the bed in the evening and slippers put out, making us feel cosseted."
2544,The Bristol,Such a great team of fun friendly staff that made the stay very enjoyable. From check in to check out the team always had a smile. The new bar is a great addition to the hotel and again the team are friendly and efficient Great to see people doing a job they enjoy!!!
2545,The Bristol,"Stayed here several times & it's in a great location. Hotel always looks well presented. Staff always helpful & friendly. Our room let it down a bit, as although a good size, the bathroom was quite small, the air-con was very noisy & the double bed dipped in the middle. However, would always be happy to stay here again."
2546,The Bristol,"Outstanding service when making my reservation; staff that are responsive to customer needs, and a clean, comfortable, friendly hotel. I stay in Bristol frequently and there is a large choice of hotels there. However, at this hotel I feel that I am actually important to them as a customer, which is why I always return here. This hotel gets the fact that it is not just facilities but customer service that sets a place apart."
2547,The Bristol,"I celebrated my birthday by staying two nights in this lovely hotel. We just want to say every area of the hotel was excellent. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful and were extremely attentive. We ate in The River Grille, the food was delicious and the staff were amazing ,particular mention to Rachel, Andrei and Myah who made the evening so special. The bar was a perfect place to end the evening with a cocktail! A lovely touch was the pianist both at dinner and during breakfast. We will definitely be back as the location is perfect to explore Bristol."
2548,The Bristol,"The hotel is very smart, clean and inviting. Staff friendly and professional. We booked using a hotel search site and our room was a great price. It was a little small but we booked a standard room. The noise was awful though from the local nightlife. We didn’t consider this before booking. I actually thought a window was open it was that loud. Better soundproofing on the windows is needed. The bed was very comfortable and the room temperature was ideal. Everything you needed was there, tea/coffee facilities, an iron, hairdryer and safe. Good shower in the bathroom. The whole room was very clean. Discounted parking is also available in the adjoined ncp carkpark"
2549,The Bristol,"Great Hotel . Reasonable priced , fantastic location. Room was very clean and clutter free, staff was friendly. Easy check in and check out. Beautiful design inside the hotel, the smell and atmosphere was superb."
2550,The Golden Sands,"Bad things - no A/C, slow wifi, garden chairs in the room not real furniture. The room TV has seen better days, needs to go. Just good enough is not good enough given the cost. Old fashion & penny pinching in a bad way, full fat milk, disgusting tap water at breakfast, poor bread selection. The good - the location is fantastic, the view is world class, the staff are helpful. The cost is too high for what you get, modern money for an old fashioned hotel."
2551,The Golden Sands,"Have been coming to the Golden Years for a holiday (or two) every year for many years. Comfortable hotel, happy helpful staff and fantastic sea views. Great base for seeing the island. Lots of places to eat out along the promenade.have tried other hotels but always end up at the Golden Sands. Hubby loves his early morning swim in the sea. The beach is so beautiful and the sea shallow and safe. Think I'll go and book my next visit!"
2552,The Golden Sands,"Sunday roast was disappointing , all other meals and breakfast was very nice. The hotel should look at the standard of the chefs for evening meals. A fridge in the room would be a great asset. The location of the hotel is great with a room overlooking the beach………………………"
2553,The Golden Sands,"Friendly staff, good price /quality. Perfect to explore the Island. Breakfast and food in the restaurant /bar are nice. Al members of the staff are SUPER friendly. It's a joy to stay in the golden Sands. We will come back again."
2554,The Golden Sands,"What a fabulous hotel the staff are all amazing they all go the extra mile to make sure you are comfortable and also so friendly. A big thankyou to mojo and all for making my sisters birthday special , we had the most wonderful time the hotel is so clean and the food excellent. The views from our room were to die for so spacious and comfortable room 401 fabulous. The beds are comfortable and we slept well. A credit to all the staff and manager for a very well run happy hotel will definitely be back thankyou ."
2555,The Golden Sands,"The location of this hotel could not be bettered. Rooms are smallish and sea view is definitely worth paying extra for. The staff are super helpful and friendly, with a special mention for Antony and the lovely Gladys on reception who made us feel very welcome. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the restaurant, with views over the bay, is well run. Breakfast has everything you could possibly want. Dinner is on the pricey side, but in line with other restaurants in the resort. Whilst the hotel has no pool or outside sitting area, the location right on the beach makes up for this. We would certainly return to the Golden Sands Hotel. For those without a car we would recommend a weekly bus pass as the buses are very frequent and reliable and can take you all over the island. …"
2556,The Golden Sands,"Stunning location, right on the beach with several good restaurants close by. The staff were fantastic, always ready to serve with a smile. There's really no other choice in Jersey now - will definitely visit again."
2557,The Golden Sands,From the moment we arrived to the moment we left the staff could not have done more for us. Very helpful with a smile. Hotel is in the perfect position in the bay. Breakfast was plentiful and what wasn't already out could be brought to your table in minutes. Would definitely go back
2558,The Golden Sands,One of the best views and best beaches to be found anywhere in the UK . If one is seeking perfect peace and tranquility there is no better place than The Golden Sands Hotel on St. Brelades beach in Jersey. The perfect getaway !!!!
2559,The Golden Sands,"The location of this hotel could not be better with fabulous location and views. The staff are the really big plus, everyone of them were happy and very helpful. The rooms are a reasonable size with a nice bathroom with a fantastic view over the beach. Breakfasts were really good, excellent selection and all cooked to perfection. We were disappointed with the restaurant, which had a menu much the same as the bar menu, which was OK for the bar but fell well short of restaurant standard. We struggled to find anything from the restaurant menu so ended up cancelling our restaurant booking and having a very mediocre burger in the bar as the bar chairs were more comfortable. The one thing that really needs attention is the ridiculous car parking ticket arrangement. We didn't know…"
2560,The Golden Sands,"Great location, literally ""on the beach"". Staff very accommodating. Very good breakfast, lots of choices, nice to have soft fruit in the mixed fruit bowl and not hard pineapple core and melons as in lots of other hotels! The only downside was that the room was very hot, no aircon in the hotel and the fan supplied was very noisy and could not be used at night"
2561,The Golden Sands,"Golden Sands is an absolute gem in St Brelade’s Bay, Jersey. It’s in an absolutely beautiful location, so I’d highly recommend the balcony rooms at this hotel. When the tide is in, the sea is literally metres away. The staff were absolutely superb. Friendly, accommodating, helpful, they just couldn’t do enough to make our stay special. Shoutout to T’Kay in the bar who’s an absolute gent, and the lovely Gladys on reception. Both went out of their way to make our trip memorable. Breakfast was excellent and there were plenty of areas to relax during the evening in the hotel. I think this may have been one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed in. Thank you to all the staff who interacted with us, helped us, and of course to the ones behind the scenes as well. We can’t wait to…"
2562,The Golden Sands,"We received warm welcome from reception staff on arrival and found all the staff friendly and more than willing and helpful to assist.The hotel is in a great location, very clean and comfortable. We only ate breakfast and evening meals both were good value and the service was excellent."
2563,The Golden Sands,A great stay - the friendliest staff - and incredible views over the bay! We were very impressed by the whole experience from check-in to check-out. Breakfast was great - we will definitely be back!!!
2564,The Golden Sands,A really lovely place....we will come back . Perfect holiday for us. A warm and friendly place to be. Excellent rooms. Top personal. And a lot of other interesting people we talked to from all over the world.
2565,The Golden Sands,Excellent food and service. You get what you pay for. Quiet and relaxed meal in the bar area this evening. Waitress Nancy was very attentive but not obtrusive or overbearing. Kerala type curry was delicious as were the fish and chips. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails available and served to a good standard.
2566,The Golden Sands,"The hotel was fantastic, it was great to wake up and look at the view over the beach. The whole stay was fantastic and the staff and hotel made it an excellent break. The meals where great and everyone from front desk to cleaners and all the other staff made it a break to remember"
2567,The Golden Sands,"Fabulous hotel, clean with amazing helpful friendly staff. Rooms great especially with the Sea view. Location was great, right on the beach with easy access. Food was brilliant especially the breakfasts."
2568,The Golden Sands,"Third visit to this lovely hotel and will return again next year. The staff and location are what makes this hotel stand out. The staff are always cheerful and extremely helpful. The location is amazing! Looking out from our balcony you could mistake it for the Caribbean! The sea is turquoise and the sand is white and pink, just beautiful. And very safe for children. The food is delicious, best Sunday roast I’ve eaten in a restaurant! And breakfast is lovely, plenty of choice and cooked well. Julia stood out for her brilliant service. We had a seaview/balcony room and a superior family room and they were both really nice. The family room was huge! And Elemis toiletries, very nice."
2569,The Golden Sands,"This is the best hotel for service, staff, food and cleanliness. Can not fault anything at all. Good choice of meals, my favourite was the crab and prawn cocktail. We always get the balcony rooms as it very bright and what a fantastic view of the bay."
2570,The Golden Sands,What a lovely clean hotel the staff was lovely nothing was to much trouble for anyone the food was spot on and everyone always had a smile on their faces and happy in their jobs which was nice to see good job everyone
2571,The Golden Sands,"From arrival the staff at the golden sands could not do enough to help, they were super friendly and helpful. The communal spaces were clean and well kept and the room fantastic. We had a sea view on the top floor and the view was amazing. Thank you so much and keep up the great work, we will definitely be back."
2572,The Golden Sands,"This hotel is in the perfect location, the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. My room on the first floor had a perfect balcony with an amazing view of the ocean. Good breakfast with excellent service."
2573,The Golden Sands,"You really couldn’t ask for a more perfect hotel… right on the beach, balcony with sea view, large comfortable rooms, genuinely friendly and helpful staff… Great selection of breakfast foods - cold buffet, hot buffet or from the kitchen. Stunning. Would definitely recommend 😊"
2574,The Golden Sands,"We had a wonderful trip, great family hotel and super friendly staff. Food was delicious too! The bar next door was a little noisy, but that was a seperate building / business so no fault of the hotel itself."
2575,The Golden Sands,"Bedroom too small, no socket on my side of bed and i could hear everything from the bedroom next door think its overpriced for an old hotel with all these problems, believe a refurbish of the hotel would be good or lower the price"
2576,The Golden Sands,"We have just stayed here for 5 nights as we were getting married in Jersey. We booked for 20 people travelling over to Jersey for the wedding and we were absolutely thrilled with the hotel. The view is absolutely amazing, location is fab but what really made the holiday a lovely experience was the staff at the hotel. They were brilliant! So welcoming and accommodating and every single department, reception, bar, breakfast, dinner, room cleaning teams…they were all fantastic! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a stay in Jersey. They made the very special occasion of our wedding, even more special for all of us!"
2577,The Golden Sands,Fantastic stay again. Friendly and professional service throughout. The location is perfect. Honestly cannot fault any aspect of our stay here. Treated ourselves to a sea view room with balcony and it did not disappoiint!
2578,The Golden Sands,"Golden Sands is one of the best hotels in Jersey. It has a very friendly staff and an excellent kitchen. There is a large, clean beach In front of the hotel and the surroundings are amazing. A bus-stop is very closely and busses take you all over the island."
2579,The Golden Sands,"We loved the balcony and bay sea views,room was kept spotlessly clean,really comfortable bed, food was good including breakfast ,all staff smiling and helpful would recommend to friends and family ,I would recommend booking directly with the hotel website,bus stop outside hotel and also public car park"
2580,The Golden Sands,"Visited for four nights as a birthday treat. From first stepping in to the hotel to leaving everything was perfect. The staff are exceptional and have never experienced this ever before. The room was very comfortable with a balcony overlooking the beautiful bay of St Brelades, everything spotlessly clean. The food truly delicious and breakfast certainly didn't disapoint. The position of the hotel is very good with a bus stop across the road that is punctual and takes you into St Helier where you are able to access most places on the island by bus. We hopefully will return as this was also a very nostalgic visit having spent many holidays in Jersey when our children were small so have many happy memories. Thank you Golden Sands for making our stay so enjoyable."
2581,The Golden Sands,This hotel is amazing and the best staff ever .we had a fantastic time😊. The food is out of this world . And the view is amazing . The beach is kept so clean . We will definitely coming back to see you
2582,The Golden Sands,"Hotel was in a great position. Rooms of good size and clean. Balcony a added bonus, however we never really used it. As we were out most of the time and the beach on the doorstep. Staff friendly, food was good 👍"
2583,The Golden Sands,"A beautiful hotel in an idyllic setting right on a glorious beach. The rooms are lovely and very clean and sitting on the balcony overlooking the sea is a great way to relax. The staff are excellent, knowledgeable and helpful and the food delicious. A lovely place to have a holiday in Jersey."
2584,The Golden Sands,"Perfect location, right on a fantastic beach. Very spacious, comfortable room. Friendly, attentive staff but also laid back and didn't rush us. Food very good, all areas very clean. Most impressive was the wonderful location"
2585,The Golden Sands,The food is amazing Hotel is spotless! The staff can not do enough for you and are so polite and kind. Great location to be able to go and visit the fascinating places that Jersey has to offer. Sitting watching the sea on the balcony of the hotel at the end of my busy day is my idea of heaven! Thank you!
2586,The Golden Sands,"4th time of visit to Golden Sands I hope should speak for itself Yes would lIke to come back again one day. If anything as disabled,a grab rail should maybe placed next to the toilet in bedroom. Overall our stay was enjoyable."
2587,The Golden Sands,"Had a Monday to Friday break,the sea view room is a must,the bed was so comfortable, staff are so friendly and couldn’t do enough for us,the breakfast was amazing,we also had the evening meal on a couple of nights,again fantastic ,would highly recommend,will definitely be going back."
2588,The Golden Sands,The perfect spot for a relaxing few days and the staff on reception were great. Lovely room. Great parking across road. Lots to do nearby and good choice of eateries. Lovely park 2 mins away. Can't think of any negatives.
2589,The Golden Sands,From the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble for the staff that we encountered. The room was ready well ahead of check-in time and a good size with a wonderful view of the bay. Breakfast was excellent and the hotel is in a perfect location for the nearby bars and restaurants as well as the local bus service.
2590,The Golden Sands,"I sustained a serious leg / foot injury on my first day. The staff were all kind , concerned and extremely helpful and they were absolutely terrific. I was grateful and touched by their kindness and concern."
2591,The Golden Sands,Lovely hotels looking over St Brelades bay. I had a couple of issues regarding my room as 411 has steps down to the room as soon as you open the door. Never received my order of tea and toast on the first morning at breakfast which was disappointing. No one came over to take away finished bowls or plates although they did with other customers.
2592,The Golden Sands,Stayed here for 2 nights in a sea facing room. Pay the extra for one as the view is remarkable. The balcony is also lovely to unwind with a glass. Restaurant is delicious for breakfast and dinner. Staff are lovely. Car park behind the hotel is chargeable but very cheap. Location is excellent for getting around the island.
2593,The Golden Sands,"From first entering the hotel we were greeted warmly by the reception team. As soon as our room was ready ( because of an early flight arrival) we were informed that we could go to our rooms. The hotel is very clean, excellent public areas, superb breakfast with super friendly attentive staff. Amazing location right on the beach. We will return as soon as we can."
2594,The Golden Sands,"From start to finish, this hotel and their team couldn’t do enough for you. We were a party of 16 and nothing was too much trouble! The food was delicious, bedrooms comfortable and what an amazing view."
2595,The Golden Sands,Just back from a fantastic 3 nights at the Golden Sands. From check in to check out the hotel was absolutely perfect. Travelled as a family of 4 with 7 and 4 year old children and we all had a fantastic holiday. We had a family room that despite having 4 good sized beds was still very spacious with the most amazing views over the bay. The food and service in the restaurant/bar was excellent and every single member of staff was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back.
2596,The Golden Sands,This hotel is 5star with 5 star food and service. There is nothing more to say about a great holiday and excellent staff. I will be back for another stay and recommend anyone giving this hotel a visit
2597,The Golden Sands,This hotel has the most amazing views. Sea view room is essential. Imagine waking to the sound of the soft waves in the morning. The staff are also amazing . If you looking for a hotel to stay in jersey either as a couple or a family this is you one.
2598,The Golden Sands,"Lovely views out to a glorious Golden beach and sea...disappointed with no fridge/ minibar, so unable to keep water and drinks chilled.....also no complimentary slippers/ bathrobes provided....main issue is no dedicated parking, and although as a Blue Badge holder parking was free, this was for only 12hrs in any 24hrs, so had to keep moving the car to another car park, sometimes early hours in the morning, which was very inconvenient"
2599,The Golden Sands,"Such an amazing hotel, great location and the staff are so friendly. The breakfast that’s included is really good (buffet, cold options, variety of hot drinks from machine and also a separate menu that you can order from). I ordered the vegetarian breakfast a few times and it was really good. Spotless rooms, with teas/coffees topped up every day along with water. Bus stop right outside the hotel which takes you to St Helier. There is a fan provided in the room which we ended up using as the weather was warm and we found it got quite hot in the room. Only negative is that we could hear the people above and beside us quite a lot but this is not necessarily the fault of the hotel, just be mindful to take earplugs if you are a light sleeper as the walls seemed quite thin. Overall it…"
2600,Dakota Manchester,The Dakota is a fantastic hotel in a great location that gives you incredible access to all of Manchester. Rooms were spacious and comfortable and service was excellent. Make sure you stop in at the bar and hopefully Haile is serving. She was a fantastic server who was generous with the advice on spots in Manchester to make sure you hit.
2601,Dakota Manchester,"Thank you to the wonderful team at Dakota Manchester. Every member of staff from pre visit phone calls, reception, dining and cleaning staff all made us feel so welcome. Everyone has a smile and something nice to say and took an interest in our stay. Really enjoyed the welcome home gentlemen on the door after our evening out. Special mention to the lovely Tom who seemed to be everywhere whenever we needed something and always had a smile and was so friendly. Our room was so comfortable and the hotel, from the comfortable and delicious dining to the buzzing bar, amazing cocktails and lovely hostesses was special. It was an expected expensive treat for us but everyone made it so worthwhile and as special as we’d hoped. Thank you!"
2602,Dakota Manchester,This really is a beautiful hotel with a modern yet traditional theme with a warm and cosy atmosphere. Make a night of it and dress to impress with a few drinks in the bar where service is 5* and head down for dinner. We had steak and it was one of the best I've had in a long time. The rooms are spacious and cosy. The mattress was a little soft for me and actually gave me a bad back but I'm used to something a little firmer. Not the greatest of locations with little bars and restaurant nearby but a bit of a walk or taxi to the centre.
2603,Dakota Manchester,"We had a lovely stay. It was one of their busiest nights and we had a booking hiccup. Despite this, the team were lovely and ensured we were looked after . Thank you Cameron and Sophie. We had a lovely room. The staff are genuinely friendly."
2604,Dakota Manchester,"Second stay at the Dakota and the experience didn't disappoint. The suite was stunning, so spacious and well-equipped - even having its own steam room. Pino and Tom from the concierge team were wonderfully attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We had friends join us for dinner on the second night: food in the Grill restaurant was excellent and, again, the staff who looked after us (Amy and Jordan) were great. First-class experience all round. Highly recommended!"
2605,Dakota Manchester,"Who travel to Manchester must stay only at the Dakota! Everything was great and beyond. Special thanks and gratitude to Mr. Pino the concierge, an absolutely wow person. Thank you Pino and viva Napoli 😃"
2606,Dakota Manchester,"We absolutely love staying here. It’s our favourite hotel by far! Being greeted from Pinot always makes our stay even better, he looked after us from the second we pulled upto the hotel. He’s amazing, thanks Pinot! We started with drinks in the terrace, wow we loved it. As we’re celebrating our anniversary we got a complimentary glass of champagne. Amazing. The guy behind the bar. ( Ben I think) Made our night extra special how he looked after us. The rooms are amazing, foods amazing and the French martinis are even better! We will see you soon Dakato! ❤️❤️❤️❤️"
2607,Dakota Manchester,My partner and I had a lovely meal at Dakota on Friday 19 May following a day of very mixed news. We were served by Liv B and James over the course of the meal and they really made our evening - we just want to say a huge thank you! We will definitely be back soon :)
2608,Dakota Manchester,"Fantastic hotel - good location, valet parking, clean and stylish, comfy beds and quiet - let down by friendly but inexperienced service. I know recruitment in the sector is challenging but price paid dictates higher expectations. Front desk often understaffed whilst breakfast and drinks service in The Dakota Grill amateurish - lack of menus, slow service and orders forgotten, poor buffet choice, cold food (despite sending back and reordering), drinks arriving after meal, no cutlery… Takes the sheen off what is otherwise a very nice and friendly hotel"
2609,Dakota Manchester,"We had an excellent stay at the Dakota. The hotel has a perfect central location. The staff were amazing from the friendly and helpful receptionist to Craig the friendly concierge, to the smiling staff in the bar."
2610,Dakota Manchester,"Loved the hotel - great service - Craig was super helpful with everything. Tried many hotels in manchester but think this is the one! Room has everything we could need and central location works for us! Cocktails are fabulous, what's not to love."
2611,Dakota Manchester,"We spent a very good evening there. We didn't have a reservation but were quickly welcomed by Anna and seated by Louis, both were very welcoming, ready to answer our questions and explain the dishes. The quality of food was excellent alongside with outstanding wine pairing recommended by our waiter Louis. Don't miss the opportunity to taste their excellent cuisine- all surrounded by the great courtesy and professionalism of the staff. We will definitely be back."
2612,Dakota Manchester,"Absolutely unreal. From the minute you walk in the staff are the epitome of professional, every member of staff was friendly and polite. Check in was easy and quick was asked questions about wether we had been before and if we needed any advice regarding the area, things to do and the facilities available. Got to the room (stayed in 608) I’m a bit of a moaner and ocd and to be honest I checked everywhere to see if it was clean and let me tell you it was immaculate! Every inch was spotless. The room itself was super luxurious and modern, my highlights were the king bed, so comfortable and the pillows and sheets were amazin. The rainfall shower was stunning, I’m 6ft 1 and i fit in easy. We went down to the outdoor terrace bar, the decor and atmosphere was high class and relaxed.…"
2613,Dakota Manchester,"Dakota Manchester is an exceptional hotel that offers luxurious accommodation and top-notch service. The hotel's rooms are spacious and well-appointed, with stylish decor and modern amenities that ensure a comfortable stay. The hotel's restaurant serves delicious food, and the bar offers a great selection of drinks, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind. The staff is friendly and always ready to assist with any request, ensuring that guests have a pleasant and stress-free experience."
2614,Dakota Manchester,"Came for dinner with friends after being here many a time before and it did not disappoint! The new menu is delicious and we had a blast! Shout out to Henry who served us, professional yet wasn’t shy to have a laugh! Having dealt with Cameron from a previous visit, it was lovely he came and said hello!"
2615,Dakota Manchester,"Lovely hotel with a quirky reception area designed by a famous designer, helpful staff and quick check in, our room was fabulous, everything looked new, great nights sleep and we dined in the restaurant for steak and cocktails all was served promptly and cooked amazing, great atmosphere and efficient friendly staff, lovely stay."
2616,Dakota Manchester,"Me and the girls had the best dinner last week which was perfect from start to finish. Our waiter Henry was the most attentive, lovely gentleman and we loved having him with us! Can't wait to return very soon."
2617,Dakota Manchester,"From the minute we arrived our experience was second to none. Nigel was absolutely incredible from taking our bags up to the room to advising us on parking, to then the following day packing the car for us and leaving water, mints and a car air freshener for when we arrived back after shopping. Every single member of staff you walk past stops to ensure you know where you are going or see to your needs. The rooms are immaculate and every detail is thought of. Overall the best hospitality we have ever received and will definitely be staying again!! Just want to say a special thank you again to Nigel as our stay would not have been as"
2618,Dakota Manchester,"Fantastic service from the minute we arrived until we checked out. Good sized rooms with comfy bed, excellent shower and toiletries. Breakfast was lovely with a great choice of made it order hot food. Drinks in the bar reasonably priced and made well. Would def recommend. The only niggles were no bathrobes in room which at this price I would expect and the king scallop dish in the restaurant was hugely disappointing but the rest of the food was great."
2619,Dakota Manchester,"This hotel is exceptional. From beginning to end of the stay, everything was seamless. All staff were friendly and well trained to undertake their roles. The hotel is beautifully appointed and has a gorgeous terrace suitable for rain or shine. The breakfast was to die for- scrambled duck eggs dish a highlight for me. I wish I had more reason to be in Manchester to get to stay in such a beautiful hotel!"
2620,Dakota Manchester,"Dakota Manchester was rated 4 star on the Internet but I would definitely give it 5 stars! My husband & I recently stayed there for 3 nights in the King garden room and we have absolutely no complaints. The hotel was simply beautiful, oozing with designer style and everything was so well thought of, from the overall decor to the room which was spot on on cleanliness, the bed was super comfortable and for 3 nights we slept like babies! Although the hotel was situated in a quiet corner of town, it was accessible to the main retail district of Picadilly and Market Street with just a 10 min walk and there were so many cafes & restaurants within walking distance around the area. Special mention must be made about the staff...especially Nigel, Vitor & Tom at concierge service. A…"
2621,Dakota Manchester,"The service we received from all the staff we encountered when stayed here was exceptional. They were all friendly and attentive and provided the level of service you wish you'd get from all hotels & restaurants which is so often lacking nowadays. The concierge guy, Pino, was brilliant. He parked our car, helped with our bags, showed us around and the warmth of service he provided is a credit to the hotel. The hotel itself is amazing. The the super huge king size bed, the quality Noir toiletries, the power showers, and the little touches like the lighting in the bathroom all made the room a comfortable luxurious place to sleep and relax in for one night. Would we go back? YES. The only suggestions or improvements I have was no mini bar in the room and no slippers or Dakota…"
2622,Dakota Manchester,"I am a frequent visitor to Leeds and this is my favourite place to stay. I take a Classic Double when going solo or Signature Suite if taking my wife along too. These are the two extremes at Dakota Hotels, and both fabulous."
2623,Dakota Manchester,"I stayed at Dakota whilst visiting an old friend who recommended it to me; I was expecting good things but wow, I was absolutely blown away. The decor, ambience, the FOOD!! The room was absolutely gorgeous, super comfy bed & the best sleep I’ve had in a while. Every single staff member I encountered was super friendly and smiley, would like to give special thanks to Brad, Haylie and Anna in the bar; George and Jordan in the restaurant (Sunday lunch was incredible!!) and Chloe on the front desk. I will absolutely return as soon as I can, thank you to everyone for making my first stay in Manchester so special."
2624,Dakota Manchester,"We always have an excellent stay at Dakota, lovely interior and good-sized bedrooms. The concierge service is great, highly recommend - Craig is very helpful, friendly and polite! The restaurant is also worth trying, especially the steak."
2625,Dakota Manchester,"Manchester City Centre Hotel but with an edge ; just a few steps into the main reception and suddenly you are wrapped in elegant luxury away from the busy streets, cocooned in a rich, warm welcome. From the stunning fresh flowers, the gentle flames of the fire in the lounge area , the sparkling and inviting bar area, you are spoilt for choice as to where to start. Upbeat, sassy and stylish yet understated, Dakota provides not only the luxury hotel stay but also a fantastic dining experience- once you have checked- in there seems little point in going out anywhere else! The food was cooked to perfection- melt in your mouth Venison , the most tender steak and deliciously served with a super- size scallop starter option. Vegetable options were also tender but firm and fragrant .…"
2626,Dakota Manchester,"I stay at Dakota once a month and cannot think of anywhere else I’d choose to stay in Manchester. Tom & The team are always on hand and everything feels really effortless. The food is always outstanding and so is the service and the cocktails are always on point. The ambiance is absolutely perfect and I always feel valued, looked after and that nothing would be too much. Great team with individual brilliance S"
2627,Dakota Manchester,"Spent my 30th birthday at Dakota and it was perfect. Room was beautiful - spotlessly clean - and every team member was warm & welcoming. Everyone made a point to say happy birthday too! Would really recommend having a drink on the Terrace - the heaters were on so lovely and warm, and service was great - the perfect place for a birthday champagne. Really buzzy and great atmosphere. Scrambled eggs at breakfast were delicious! Thank you Dakota for making my birthday so special 😊"
2628,Dakota Manchester,"A cross-city pub crawl finished off at the Dakota Cigar Terrace … Sublime! Ania and Kevin looked after us tremendously, both whisky and cigar offerings and pairings were really impressive and the terrace is itself is comfortable space to wind down the evening. A couple drams of Dalmore and a Montecristo capped off a great evening. 10/10, I look forward to returning again soon!"
2629,Dakota Manchester,"We had planned a trip to Manchester for my partners birthday and I wanted to book that extra little something for the hotel to completely surprise him. So happy that Dakota offer a deluxe balloon package to add onto your booking, this made everything so much easier! The team at Dakota, particularly Diamond and Katherine were amazing! Super accommodating, efficient, speedy with replies and completely understood the memo! The setup of the hotel looked amazing and we couldn’t thank them both enough! Thank you for making our stay so special, we will be back soon!"
2630,Dakota Manchester,"I have previously stayed in Dakota many times due to ease of access to Manchester City Centre and amazing rooms (we have stayed in the King, Signature and Junior Suites), my partner decided for my birthday to book a night away for my birthday on the 26th March 2023. He chose Dakota due to this being one of my favourite places to stay and booked via. booking.com on the 10th March paying the full amount in advance. When we arrived at Dakota we checked in fine, had a lovely stay and checked out as normal the following day (staff told us there were no charges to pay). However the following morning we woke to find two payments of £147.42 were taken from our account. We immediately contacted Dakota who told us that they couldn't help as we booked with booking.com. After contacting…"
2631,Dakota Manchester,"We booked at the hotel for a proposal to my partner and also booked dinner at the Dakota grill (separate review added). I arranged the hotel booking via email direct with the reservations team via and a huge thank you to Noura, Thabassum and Leah (grill reservation) who helped me organise a wonderfully special evening. We booked the deluxe suite which is just simply stunning along with two other rooms for our friends. The cleanliness and quality was perfect. From arrival to checkout the staff could not do enough to help us. From the room, to the bar, to the cigar terrace, to the restaurant…it was all just perfect. A fantastic stay with a yes from my girlfriend."
2632,Dakota Manchester,"We recently stayed here as part of a weekend break and booked an Executive Suite for 2 nights. The room was superb, beautifully appointed, a great atmosphere and overall just a wonderful place to be. Probably one of the best places in Manchester to stay and we've pretty much stayed in them all! The staff were also very welcoming, from the moment we checked in and throughout the stay, they were very accommodating. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication regarding valet parking. Prior to our stay we had enquired about this and were told it would be £35 for the duration of our stay (2 nights), however on check-in we were informed it is in fact £35 per night, only for our vehicle to be parked off-site in a car park that is half the cost. Had we known this, we wouldn't have…"
2633,Dakota Manchester,"Outstanding level of customer service from Diamond on the front desk, so helpful throughout the evening of our stay. The hotel as a whole was a pleasant surprise, immaculate decor and even higher level of standards. We have booked again for end of April."
2634,Dakota Manchester,Came in with some friends to have a nice chilled drink. Got a cigar and few drinks just because of how great the staff were! Ben especially was amazing offering great selections on drinks and cigars! Will definitely be returning! Amazing visit and I suggest to anyone wanting a nice stay/drink In Manchester!
2635,Dakota Manchester,"Absolutely outstanding from start to finish. Attentive, friendly staff and first class service. Gorgeous executive king suite with great amenities and white company toiletries. Would definitely recommend and will be returning. The moment we arrived the concierge was there to greet us. Seamless check in and service and friendly staff. Very unusual to see this level of customer service and this made a very refreshing change. Every member of staff was happy and extremely attentive. Cannot fault this stay one bit and will definitely return in the future. The bar & grill is fantastic too. Gorgeous surroundings and decor"
2636,Dakota Manchester,"I have been amazed by my stay at Dakota. From the welcome from the reception team (diamond was amazing during my stay) , to the hospitality and bar staff and let me not forget the stunning interior of the room. I was made to feel at home and not many hotels are able to do this successfully. Would definitely recommend Dakota Manchester to my friends and family."
2637,Dakota Manchester,"I had cause to go to Dakota Manchester to wait for a friend who was going to be an hour late. I’m not comfortable at all with going into bars alone but I needn’t have worried. I was greeted and looked after by Ben and Hayley. They were courteous, polite, professional and put me completely at ease with being there on my own. In the end my friend arrived and as the service had been so good we decided to stay for the afternoon and have lunch too. They are both a credit to The Dakota Family."
2638,Dakota Manchester,"Myself and my partner came to Manchester for the first time in a while and I have to say from start to finish it was exceptional. Absolutely nothing to fault, we treated ourselves to a dinner in the restaurant and just wow, Caitlin made it so special for us and was a delight to talk to. The bar had some incredible cocktails and Liv really helped us choose ones that we loved! Thank you so much, we will definitely be back!"
2639,Dakota Manchester,"What a HOTEL... YOU HAVE TO BOOK.... no other other like this in Manchester, Start to finish, service, impeccable, FOOD ! ROOMS, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE INCREDIBLE staff, cannot do enough for you.... Nora YOU HAVE BEEN AMAZING thank you for all your help.... COULD NOT DO ENOUGH. The rooms are INSANE please book and experience for yourself I THANK YOU ALL XXXX"
2640,Dakota Manchester,Hayley always remembers my drink order and is a pleasure to be served by. Dakota is a lovely venue… yes you pay a premium but for the level of service and atmosphere it is certainly worth it. All the staff are very attentive and are a great asset to the company and brand
2641,Dakota Manchester,"I visited Dakota for the first time in January. My friends and I had a few drinks in the bar before going through to the restaurant. We were then greeted by Caitlin who took care of us. She recommended the steak and a lovely bottle of wine that paired brilliantly, most importantly she made sure our glasses were never empty! I enjoyed the experience so much I came back a couple weeks later for my mums birthday, who was as impressed as I was, and that isn't easy! I'm looked forward to my next visit to Dakota."
2642,Dakota Manchester,"Had the loveliest meal at Dakota! Me and my mum loved the cocktails& we had steak on recommendation of our waitress, caitlin. It was a great evening. Caitlin was patient and friendly throughout our visit, we will definitely return!"
2643,Dakota Manchester,"We returned to the Dakota, after an unfortunately disappointing visit last year. I believe this must’ve just been an unlucky day, as our return visit last week was nothing short of exceptional. The room was spotless and they are beautifully designed, service was warm from the moment we arrived and the taste of Dakota menu was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our return visit and could not have been better looked after throughout. Particular thanks to Cameron for his help in arranging the stay and to Diamond and Ellie looking after us when checking in and dining!"
2644,Dakota Manchester,"Just had a lovely stay in Dakota Manchester. The staff, especially Ben in the bar and Tom the Operations Manager went out of their way to make our stay special. We also ate in the Dakota Grill and had the Taste of Dakota menu - our thanks and praises go to the chef for a fabulous meal and to the waitresses for their attentiveness. All in all a great stay and we will definitely return. Thank you...Debbie & Paul"
2645,Dakota Manchester,We hired out the terrace for an event. Brad and the team were absolutely wonderful. Super accommodating and careful with allergies. Great communication leading up to the event and throughout the night. They enabled a truly enjoyable experience for all! We’ll definitely be coming back!
2646,Dakota Manchester,"From check in to check out all was perfect. Every member of staff we interacted with was brilliant and the room was very comfortable and made you want to linger. Excellent shower and White Stuff toiletries, all replenished during our stay. Only niggle is that in a hotel of this calibre I would really expect Nespresso in the king rooms too but that's just a personal niggle because I hate instant coffee. Plenty of coffee shops nearby though. I will review the restaurant separately but the bar was outstanding too. Wonderful atmosphere and great cocktails. Have already booked to return!"
2647,Dakota Manchester,Myself and my cousin came in for food and drinks! We had amazing steaks and side orders! Henry was amazing at keeping our wine topped up and giving us recommendations! Kevin was absolutely amazing at coming up with great cocktails and shots! He’s a cocktail wizard!! Bens service in the bar was brilliant as well! We cannot wait to return again in the future!’
2648,Dakota Manchester,Came to Dakota with my family for dinner! The food and service was outstanding! Great atmosphere and amazing cocktails! Aimee and Henry served us in the restaurant and gave us lots of recommendations! I had the stone bass and my family had steaks! Ben and Kevin in the bar got us lots of tasty cocktails after our dinner! Best meal I’ve had in a very long time! Can’t wait to return again when I come back to Manchester!
2649,Dakota Manchester,"Wonderful hotel with excellent staff especially the front desk and concierge The room was amazing and will definitely stop here again Worth the extra for the executive room Close to the nightlife, and the shopping with a nice relaxing atmosphere by being near the canal"
2650,Vintry & Mercer,"Outstanding hotel experience with wonderful staff. The rooms are stunning, and the location within the city is hard to beat. My only gripe is with the service at the roof terrace restaurant. There’s no priority for guests, which I can accept given the prime location for diners - however it would be a nice touch for guests to be offered a reservation on their check-in day. This is something I’ve experienced at other 5* hotels and it goes a long way in making you feel special. Another service issue I had with the roof terrace restaurant was the attentiveness of the staff. I was flabbergasted when, half way through taking our order, the waiter asked me to “give him a minute” so he could say goodbye to one of his mates. I found this to be extremely unprofessional and it gave a…"
2651,Vintry & Mercer,"Beautiful hotel, boutique feel, very friendly staff and lovely buzzy atmosphere. Rooms very comfortable and spacious. Breakfast choice great. Easy to get to public transport wise and close to the Thames. Recommended."
2652,Vintry & Mercer,"I have had many city breaks around the world but this hotel is definitely on my revisit list! Our stay was to celebrate 3 of a party of 4 Birthdays. Prior to arrival I received great communication and was able to request for rooms to be together for our stay. On our arrival we were warmly greeted by the staff and the aromas and ambiance definitely set the scene on the rest of the stay. Special shout out to Dimitri Cigliano - your welcome and chats during our short stay was definitely a highlight, next time we will make sure you and the rest of the team get an invite to our night out! 🤣 The rooms have everything you could wish for, dressing gowns, slippers, hairdryer, free soft drink mini bar, umbrellas etc We used both the downstairs bar - very atmospheric and great cocktails.…"
2653,Vintry & Mercer,"Had an absolute pleasure staying in Vintry & Mercer. Amazing minibar selection, cosy room, great service and location. From the moment we checked in till the end of our stay, the staff were all extremely helpful and pleasant, I wish I could have gotten their names. It may be a boutique hotel but it's big on hospitality and value. Highly recommend."
2654,Vintry & Mercer,"A quiet hotel, with excellent comfort and service, in central london. We ate in the restaurant and the service and food were excellent. Reception staff were welcoming and helpful. Top marks go to housekeeping, the hotel is very well presented and clean. The decor and design really add to the ambience of this lovely boutique hotel."
2655,Vintry & Mercer,"Lovely hotel, friendly helpful staff. A touch of luxury throughout the room The perfect location for the sightseeing around thw city of London and Southbank. Plus convenient transport links to travel further out We will be back"
2656,Vintry & Mercer,Really such a pleasure to go to this hotel every time. The rooms are soooooooo comfortable and clean and with a great view. The bed is great for a business traveller. The staff is also very very nice. I get almost the same room every time and that is really helpful for me. Recommend with my eyes closed!
2657,Vintry & Mercer,"Welcomed warmly upon arrival and the rooftop deck for dinner the first night was wonderful. Room is a little small, but not considering one is in downtown London. Near a number of tourist sites, but quieter on the weekends than other locations."
2658,Vintry & Mercer,"I was staying at V&M for a business trip and was not disappointed by my choice. Location for me was superb as I was 5 minutes walking distance to my office. Service in general was great. The rooftop bar was an amazing place to spend some time when the weather is good. If you stay here, at least try and make one trip down to the Do Not Disturb bar. Ayhan at the bar is a wonderful person and deserves a shoutout for how warm and welcoming he is. I very much appreciated it as a solo visitor Value wise, this place is on the more expensive end and my room was quite small. It didn't really impact me that greatly but I was staying by myself for business. If you were a couple and got a similar size room, I think you would struggle to find places to put luggage without it being in the…"
2659,Vintry & Mercer,I’ve been all over the world and this hotel checked all the boxes for what we wanted. I’ll be back the next time I’m in London. I’ll be recommending this hotel to anyone I know visiting London. This is my new favorite hotel!
2660,Vintry & Mercer,"We were so excited to stay in this hotel having read other reviews and done our research, however it was more than disappointing. One big issue can really ruin a hotel experience but equally so can minor issues when they are one after the other. Our room wasn't ready on arrival (after check in time), we asked to receptionist to check our roof top bar reservation and were told she couldn't and we had to go up and check ourselves, the time of our booking was then messed up which meant we were rushed for no reason. Our room - the shower gel in the shower was completely empty, there was only 1 water/ 1 popcorn etc in the complimentary mini bar - I understand complimentary but there are 2 guests? Our shower wasn't draining properly meaning we could stay in the shower for 5 minutes…"
2661,Vintry & Mercer,"What a beautiful rooftop setting, exquisite food and fantastic, attentive service from all of the staff. Thank you for a wonderful Birthday meal with my family to remember. We will be back again soon."
2662,Vintry & Mercer,"I have stayed at this hotel 2 times now, it is a very convenient location for my work, but mostly I love it, because the staff is very friendly and helpful and the place has a boutique and unique feel about it. I have been recommending to everyone, who is traveling."
2663,Vintry & Mercer,"Vintry & Mercer, based around the corner from Mansion House underground and very close to St Paul's, is a tasteful and extremely comfortable hotel where you are given five-star treatment; especially by the staff at reception who could not be more helpful if they tried. Nothing is too much trouble for them when it comes to helping customers. The rooms are thoughtfully and beautifully decorated, the beds comfortable with soft, fluffy pillows while the shower is just the right velocity and offers instant hot water. There is no danger of having to stand for five minutes outside the shower waiting for warm water! Do be aware though that breakfast is not included in the overnight stay. You are given a menu and everything has to be ordered individually. There is no breakfast buffet…"
2664,Vintry & Mercer,"It’s a very unique hotel. I like the decoration. Though the standard room is very small, it has everything you need. High quality of service, and all room fabric and furnitures are in good taste and quality as well. The rooftop restaurant is a plus."
2665,Vintry & Mercer,This is a lovely hotel in a great location. Rooms are comfortable but small. We had a really nice breakfast here too. I really liked the decor at the hotel and its proximity to the tube stations. A nice stay overall.
2666,Vintry & Mercer,Lovely hotel. Reception staff were really friendly. DND bar downstairs was a lovely vibe and cocktails were great. Room was beautiful with some lovely modern design features. Right next to mansion house tube station. Would recommend and planning on coming again soon!
2667,Vintry & Mercer,"From our arrival to our departure the staff and our room at Vintry & Mercer delivered service and a feel of splendor, far beyond our expectations. The location it self is good. (actually in walking distance to Picadelly.) and we received good information about places to have a meal on arrival. Quite a lot of places around the hotel to have a meal, a snack and something in the glass. The front desk staff was very friendly, and the staff on the roof top terrace even so."
2668,Vintry & Mercer,"Really nice hotel with that ""different' feel you look for against beige chain hotels .. all without it being overpoweringly ""different"". Just a good comfortable vibe throughout and nicely appointed rooms and shared areas. Perhaps just a little on the expensive side for what I thought the hotel should charge but all in all a great hotel, central locations in the City and a bit of a refuge from the outside world."
2669,Vintry & Mercer,"Very good hotel - Top service and staff is happy to help you with anything. Metro is just around the corner and a lovely hotel bar + terrace the have lunch. Room clean, perfectly designed and quietly situated in this wonderful city."
2670,Vintry & Mercer,"I booked this hotel for a weekend stay for our anniversary, mainly after reading the reviews. We have stayed at many 5 star hotels within London at twice the price of this one. Wow we will stay here again as we didn’t have to leave as it has it all, rooftop restaurant/bar, basement cocktail bar. Very attentive staff & great service and just 1 minutes walk from a tube station. So clean and well looked after and with a few upgrades given when they found out it was our anniversary. Thanks to everyone we met that made our special weekend more amazing"
2671,Vintry & Mercer,Can’t put a price of great service. We were attending to quickly always. The staff were very prompt. When we arrived we were upgraded which made it even better. Will recommend this to others most definitely.
2672,Vintry & Mercer,It was a fantastic stay in a beautiful hotel and location. The room was good and the noises from outside were perfectly reduced. The bath cq shower was a little bit difficult because the shower is in the bath and therefor the bathroom became very wet
2673,Vintry & Mercer,Lovely hotel. The staff & service were great. Room very clean. Breakfast choice was great. We had the full English and we couldn’t fault it. The rooftop bar was just lovely. Good was delicious! Would def come back again. The Mansion house tube station was literally a few mins walk from hotel.
2674,Vintry & Mercer,"We had a really nice stay here, the bed was so comfortable and the room was gorgeous. There was a couple of details that spoiled the trip slightly however. We were given a complimentary breakfast but then asked to pay for one of them, also no one was available for the room service when required."
2675,Vintry & Mercer,"We could not fault the hotel - staff were amazing, room was beautiful and well equipped, location is great, roof terrace phenomenal, breakfast excellent and great value for money - we usually stay in Mayfair but this was better in every sense of the word without the price tag so would highly recommend"
2676,Vintry & Mercer,Room was stunning and in a spotless condition! Staff were completely attentive and on call 24/7 for any needs! Perfect location just off the river and the atmosphere was just perfect! Would definitely return and recommend!
2677,Vintry & Mercer,"The Vintry & Merced hotel is the place to stay when in London. The level of luxury, attention to detail of the hotel and service from staff made for a wonderful experience. Between staff tips for places to explore to proximity to major landmarks it was the ideal place for us. The rainfall shower, robe and slipper combo, and plushy king sized bed provided the perfect environment to refresh."
2678,Vintry & Mercer,Gorgeous hotel in the heart of London. So close by tube or walking to most sightseeing spots. Quiet and safe neighborhood. Staff was extremely professional and friendly. Extremely helpful with suggestions
2679,Vintry & Mercer,"Perfect hotel for two nights to explore the heart of London. Located near access to many things made walks, bus rides and dining convenient. The hotel service was terrific, the food was excellent, the rooms were quiet and the decor beautiful."
2680,Vintry & Mercer,"Everyone was top marks.The hotel setting is lovely,the staff are lovely and accomodating.I loved the room,quite,private and very stylist. I forgot my alarm in my room, was contacted and advised that they would posted it to my address. You guys are cool as a cucumber. Love you all!!!😉"
2681,Vintry & Mercer,"I remembered staying at V&M pre-pandemic and wanted to return - the Hotel was everything I remembered and more, from check-in to check-out, the Hotel, the service and overall ambience of the place was excellent. I look forward to my next stay ..."
2682,Vintry & Mercer,"Had a wonderful stay and will definitely return again. Facilities and room were excellent, really clean and room was very well equipped with everything you need for a comfortable stay plus lots of extra nice touches. Didn’t eat but did have drinks in the bar and would highly recommend a visit during your stay for cocktails. The staff were friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Have already recommended to family who visit London regularly and I would definitely book again"
2683,Vintry & Mercer,"Boutique hotel with a warm welcoming ambience. Conveniently located in a quiet area but within walking distance of city sights including St Pauls Cathedral, Tate Modern and the Shard. Standard rooms small but beautifully furnished."
2684,Vintry & Mercer,Stunning hotel in central london. Staff were wonderful and room was huge & and exceeded expectation. General manager was visible and provided excellent and personalised service. Will make this my go to hotel in London.
2685,Vintry & Mercer,"Beautiful hotel, with a wonderful relaxed feel to it. The excellent service and beautiful rooms came with such attention to detail. The hotel bars and restaurant transport you to another world, away from reality. Amazing cocktails and thoughtful settings. Thank you, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
2686,Vintry & Mercer,"We were here celebrating my partners birthday and her final remark was that she was made to feel very special and looked after through our entire stay. The staff were extremely helpful and nothing was too much to ask for. Extremely well furnished and decorated hotel with a lovely fresh, classic style. Situated just to the side of the river Thames, the location was just perfect for all our afternoon activities, food and drink or nightlife shannagings."
2687,Vintry & Mercer,"Crystal big downstairs at 8am sunday woke us up. Hotel clean and people are great. The sleep experience was bad, we tought that for the pricetag, this should be properly look into... Breakfast was delicious"
2688,Vintry & Mercer,Perfect hotel and nice and quiet. Stayed for business so the staff met my needs well. Room was lovely. Bed was comfy. Shower was fab. Lots of little extras. Mini bar full and decent stock. Black out curtains and easy low/Med/high lighting for the early morning start. I will be back.
2689,Vintry & Mercer,"The hotel is extremely clean. The rooms are decorated thoughtfully although a little on the small side, they are adequate and contained lots of little finishing touches. Highly recommended for a city breaks."
2690,Vintry & Mercer,"This is a a fantastic boutique hotel in the City of London with stylish interiors, excellent service, and a delicious breakfast. Definitely a great choice for couples, solo travellers, and business travellers."
2691,Vintry & Mercer,"Vintry & Mercer is a chic and stylish hotel located in the heart of London. The hotel's interior design is a beautiful blend of contemporary and traditional elements, creating an atmosphere of both sophistication and comfort. The rooms are spacious and elegantly furnished with all the modern amenities you'd expect from a luxury hotel. The staff are friendly and attentive, always willing to go the extra mile to ensure your stay is enjoyable. The hotel's location is perfect for exploring the city, with many of London's top attractions just a short walk away. Overall, Vintry & Mercer is a wonderful choice for anyone looking for a luxurious and comfortable stay in London."
2692,Vintry & Mercer,Good value for money at this 5-star gem. Do not forget to visit the roof top bar. Good location if you are doing business near bank. Close to the nice borough market for nice food. Recommend to bring running shoes since it is close to river Themes and it is perfect to have a morning run on both sides of the river.
2693,Vintry & Mercer,"Blown away by this hotel, the most amazing staff who helped us before we had even left our taxi, showed us to our room whilst giving us a tour etc. i am sorry if I completely missed your name…but Alexander I believe, you are amazing!!!! Accommodating & friendly. Beautiful room, I don’t think I’ve ever stayed in a hotel as clean as this place which is so refreshing. Complimentary drinks in our rooms, which you could request more of if needed. Gorgeous bathroom with a load of freebies. STUNNING roof top which we had dinner or and even better breakfast downstairs. I was so sad to leave and already am planning a trip back. THANK YOU. X"
2694,Vintry & Mercer,"Just a fabulous hotel that has quickly become my number one choice when staying in London for business during the week or for leisure over the weekend. The rooms are really comfortable, the food is excellent, and Dimitri and his wonderful staff always go above and beyond to make every stay a great one."
2695,Vintry & Mercer,"Loved this gorgeous hotel. Location is fantastic for exploring the City and south of the river. Common areas are nice and there are free newspapers to read while you wait, great rooftop bar and a small but well-equipped gym. The room was beautiful, quiet as requested and no scatter cushions – amazing. Minibar is included in the price and is stocked up, but with some room for your own things. A highlight is the extremely helpful and friendly staff. All of them, but in particular those on reception. One suggestion – as there is a big move for people to reuse towels, a heated towel rail in the bathroom would be great, as the bathroom heating doesn’t dry them. Other than that, it’s pretty much perfect. Can’t wait to go back."
2696,Vintry & Mercer,"Superb hotel. Tucked away down a small lane, this hotel is pure luxury and decadence. Beautiful rooms, first class breakfast, lovely rooftop bar with glass pods and amazing cocktails. Highly recommended for business or private visits. I will definitely be back."
2697,Vintry & Mercer,"Decided to try a new hotel for a recent visit to London and plumped for this one. It is well located and tucked down a quiet street right next to Mansion house station. We were greeted nicely by everyone on the team and check-in was very smooth. The room is lovely, interesting decor that makes it feel a bit nicer than other boutique or luxury hotels. The bathroom was well appointed and the shower had great heat and water pressure. The bed was very comfy and we both slept well as there was virtually no noise from other rooms or outside, just the occasional peel of bells from a distant church. The rooms are a little compact in comparison to other London hotels we've stayed in, but not uncomfortably so. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, we tried it our first morning and whilst…"
2698,Vintry & Mercer,Great location and wonderful staff who were so helpful. Breakfast was excellent and roof terrace a lot of fun. We had a brilliant weekend. The room was small but bed very comfortable and clean and very little noise
2699,Vintry & Mercer,"Went here to meet up with my husband for a quick weekend. Hotel was very nice and located in a quieter area of London, which suited us quite well. The room was the size you’d expect from a hotel of this class and price range. The bed and room was luxuriously furnished and check in was a breeze. The toiletries were quite nice and the rubber ducky was cute. The water, tea, and coffee provided in the room are good and replenished on a daily basis. The speakeasy downstairs was nice, if a little quiet, but it made it easy for us to find a seat. The rooftop bar and restaurant was also a pleasant place to enjoy drinks and nibbles when we came back to the hotel to rest or change. The tube is very close and it was easy to reach via Heathrow for my husband and via Waterloo station…"
2700,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Absolutely amazing holiday, staff are warm and welcoming. Facilities are incredible, and the beach is gorgeous. Only downside is as a young couple other residents seemed to judge us a bit. But this is not the fault of staff by any means."
2701,Watergate Bay Hotel,"I have stayed here A LOT over the years, since 2007. I married here in 2009 and my son has grown up coming here. I LOVE to travel and experience new places, but this place has my heart completely. Every experience I've had here and every interaction has been incredible. Some of my happiest memories are here. The whole place/vibe/people are stunning. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE"
2702,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Family friendly? No. No kids in pool after 6:00 pm. No children in gym. No children in sauna. We work out/swim as a family. Not here. Did not book the 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm kid activity center. Asked if we could be allowed in and even pay. Desk workers gleefully said no. More of that passive-aggressive English ""we don't flex on policy"" attitude. They did say we could get in at 9:30 after the session. At 9:30 pm we showed up and two teens were doing COVID-protocol cleanup in the room (June 2023!) and said, ""The centre will not be open until 10 pm. Is that alright?"" Now, I know this question is rhetorical and polite in England, but I decided to say, ""No, it is not alright. We were told the room would be open at 9:30 and now you are saying we need to wait an additional 30 minutes?"" I…"
2703,Watergate Bay Hotel,"The hotel is gorgeous, the views amazing and the staff incredible. We absolutely loved our stay and can't wait to go back ASAP! Incredible beach walks and caves to explore especially when the tide is out. I highly recommend this property it's a magical place!"
2704,Watergate Bay Hotel,With a nearby domestic airport link this made for an enjoyable and accessible few days within a great hotel and at a lovely location. The attention to detail and helpfulness of all the staff just added to this overall experience. Well done !
2705,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Wonderful location, could be amazing, staff lovely, but feels a bit like a chain. No thinking outside the box. So close to being excellent. As long as you liked their rules. Very difficult to ask for something different."
2706,Watergate Bay Hotel,"To be able to arrive in 4 hours from London without having to consider dog-care makes the Watergate Bay Hotel a no-brainer solution for the perfect weekend escape. Swapping traffic and pavements for the sea and sand is good for the mind but when combined with a hotel stay delivering first class hospitality from the moment you arrive you need look no further. High quality fit out throughout, wonderful amenities and bedding to enable the best possible sleep provides the perfect combination to look after every need, not mentioning the great food and drink selection on offer which take the place to the next level. Soho House could learn a thing or two from how Watergate Bay Hotel operates."
2707,Watergate Bay Hotel,"The best hotel we have ever stayed at - amazing facilities, beautiful spaces and so comfortable. Right on the beach! Food was excellent, particularly breakfast. Wonderful swimming pool. Child and dog friendly. Free parking for the duration of your stay. Possible to use all facilities for full day on check in/ check out days - a big bonus! Excellent pizza and coffees nearby."
2708,Watergate Bay Hotel,"As ever, Watergate Bay hotel was lovely. They need to improve the loungers and bedroom storage (style over substance prevails) and then it would be perfect. Staff are incredibly attentive, friendly and kind."
2709,Watergate Bay Hotel,Can't get a better spot than Watergate Bay Hotel on such a stunning beach front location. We love this hotel as it is super stylish but totally relaxed and so dog friendly. Staff service is generally excellent. We tried beach yoga one morning and it was fab. Food is fantastic. Highly recommended.
2710,Watergate Bay Hotel,Incredible sunset! Room was gorgeous! Amazing food and drink! Friendly warm staff! Views to die for. Every family member thought of even our furry friend! Looking forward to coming back really soon! :)I haven’t been anywhere in the UK since covid where everything has been this amazing and great to see some happy faces!
2711,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Fantastic break, sadly only one night, but accommodation and dining excellent, a very warm welcome from all of the team,. As a former hotelier I was very impressed with the standards and the genuine warmth of the team. Supper on the terrace was memorable, as was the breakfast! Cannot wait to go back and we only live less than a hour away!"
2712,Watergate Bay Hotel,"This hotel sits right on the beach. We love this place but it is expensive in every way and impacted on our stay this time. Our room overlooked the beach which was out of this world. The children’s play area directly below us was not ideal for the tranquil setting- maybe move this slightly away from the rooms, Noise travels! We have stayed here for the last couple of years and always look forward to it. This year we enjoyed the sunshine and the beach more than the hotel. Lacks the personal touch for a hotel that is expensive to stay at."
2713,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Week long stay for our honeymoon, fantastic time away. However the service in the living space needs a lot of work as the staff on multiple occasions are stood around talking and we have waited more than 35 minutes just to get a drink. When we then go to the bar we get told it’s table service!"
2714,Watergate Bay Hotel,What a place to enjoy a birthday - waking up to the sound of the sea was bliss and what a view! Challenging myself to a surf lesson was exhilarating and the hot tub and fizz afterwards equally as lovely. The quality of food means every meal is treat. We went as a couple on this occasion but the family friendly atmosphere was great.
2715,Watergate Bay Hotel,"We absolutely loved our stay at watergate bay, it holds a special memories for us as we got married there 2 years ago but every time we return we feel so well looked after. They have the balance of family friendly and comfort with luxury just right. Great food, activities and facilities it has everything we need for our young family and more."
2716,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Stunning decor, perfect location, great surf school. Very dog and family friendly. Lots of parking and great perk that it’s free. The best breakfast offer I’ve ever had at a hotel. Highly recommend!!!!"
2717,Watergate Bay Hotel,Had the best stay ever in this amazing place wow ! Staff and management brilliant. Ambience incredible. Food experience amazing. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel and spa as spotlessly clean and faultless. Neil Winstone Alfriston East Sussex
2718,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Amazing location, hotel was stunning and staff were amazing! Huge thanks, location stunning and staff went above and beyond! Shout out to Ricky in the Living Space who was great, looked after us extremely well. This place was also great for Gluten Free with everything clearly marked or explained. Huge thanks!"
2719,Watergate Bay Hotel,We had a fantastic stay at the Watergate Bay hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Our partial sea view room was beautiful and very comfy with a lovely view of the bay. The food was good and the breakfast excellent. Such a stunning setting. Only one small hiccup with the bill which was swiftly resolved once pointed out. We will definitely stay again.
2720,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Have visited Watergate Bay many times. Had a wonderful time with our dog Ruby who had her 9th birthday when we were there.Ate at all the hotel restaurants , which were very good .we had wonderful sunny weather which was a big bonus ."
2721,Watergate Bay Hotel,"I don’t think it’s a hotel for elderly couples. The vibe is very much families, dog-owners and beach- goers. The restaurants are functional rather than traditional and the food nice rather than outstanding. The service was variable from poor at its worst to excellent at best. Parking can be tight, and some rooms are a long way from the public areas."
2722,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Exceptional hotel with incredible facilities, perfect for a romantic break. We eloped to Cornwall and stayed to celebrate our wedding with a beach loft room that worth every penny. The hotel has outstanding attention to detail, professional and forward thinking staff who made the trip feel extra special at every possible moment"
2723,Watergate Bay Hotel,"On the beach relaxation with great food, great facilities & great staff, what’s not to love! The hotel is dog friendly so our baby was as pampered as us and she loved every minute. The views and walks are spectacular."
2724,Watergate Bay Hotel,We called in for a coffee and sat outside. The view of the beach is outstanding. Inside the Living Space has a lovely relaxing comfortable vibe. This really is a lovely place. When the bill came I asked if I could pay cash. The waitress wasn’t sure but said it was probably possible. Paying by card wasn’t a problem for me so I was about to pay when I asked my husband how much the bill was. I was so glad that I did because the bill wasn’t ours and was much more than we had spent. Eventually the correct bill was brought to us but we didn’t have a good feeling when we left.
2725,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Between the staff, the food, the decor and cleanliness-the standard has been consistently Brilliant! I literally rolled myself to bed every night after a day of eating some delicious food and cocktails. Also a perfect place for introducing my dog to the beach and sea!"
2726,Watergate Bay Hotel,Beautiful views and a stunning location. Would recommend for a special occasion. A resort feel despite being a hotel. Lots to do and close to the south west coastal path for walks. Memories to last a lifetime!
2727,Watergate Bay Hotel,I went for a three day break with family . Love the hotel and the location is extra special. The leisure facilities are fantastic. We had to request a change of room due to an ankle injury and the staff were very quick to sort this out. The food offering is great as well with a number of options at the hotel.
2728,Watergate Bay Hotel,Absolutely beautiful hotel clean tidy very nice looking perfect place beautiful friendly helpful staff.. Everything the stay the hotel the location perfect.. Food fantastic views beautiful just everything was amazing
2729,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Overpriced, won't be returning, cannot recommend. Tired decor, unhelpful staff, this is a hotel that relies on its location and doesn't live up to expectations. I booked this stay as a birthday surprise for my husband, very disappointed......"
2730,Watergate Bay Hotel,We have stayed at the watergate bay hotel a number of times and have never been anything less than delighted. The setting is stunning and you cannot help but feel relaxed from the money you check in. The restaurants all provide excellent service and incredible food. We have stayed as both a family and a couple and both experiences have been amazing. We will definitely be returning again soon.
2731,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Wonderful hotel, incredible breakfast, stunning views, wonderful spa , all made better by the super friendly and excellent staff. The sauna is a great addition to the spa and the choice of restaurants without having to go far is ideal."
2732,Watergate Bay Hotel,Great location and a cool hotel. But slow service in the bar a shame. Breakfast a particular triumph. Otherwise one of the best hotels in the South West. Pricey in high season but always seems to be full!
2733,Watergate Bay Hotel,"All in all we had a nice stay, but there are some things that do make me not wanting to book another stay here. First, the positives: - Super friendly and helpful staff - Great location directly at the beach, though in peak season I would not want to be there - Nice rooms. Spacious, clean and modern. Great bathrooms as well. - Great breakfast. - Good restaurants, we had meals in all of them. Why I would not come back: - Due to availability we did not have a room with sea-view but oriented towards the road and parking lots. The room quickly became hot and stuffy during the day and was very noisy. Not what I would expect considering the price. - All in all, the Hotel has an ""all-inclusive"" flair to it. Again, considering the price, I would expect more. Conclusion: Good hotel,…"
2734,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Beautiful place, lovely hotel and restaurants and great, friendly and helpful staff. Even if the weathers not great, this place feels perfect - the huge expanse of beach and sky - it's heaven! The other facilities are also excellent."
2735,Watergate Bay Hotel,Fantastic room with great attention to detail. Went to a short break for my wife’s birthday and ordered flowers and fizz upon arrival which did not disappoint. Took our dogs for a few great walks and had lovely weather which helps but not essential. Cost of loft with best views is not cheap but well worth it. Will be returning.
2736,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Fantastic hotel both the accommodation, facilities and service…not to mention a great location. The hotel was warm and welcoming. Our sea view room was beautiful and the bed extremely comfortable. The swimming pool and spa facilities were impressive…great space for a relax! We had a lovely coastal walk which starts from the hotel itself. Our stay here definitely stood out from the crowd and I’ll definitely be returning."
2737,Watergate Bay Hotel,We stayed here for our honeymoon and the experience was just wonderful. Our room overlooked the sea and we enjoyed the most stunning sunsets from here. Food in all the restaurants we tried was spot on and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We can't wait to visit again.
2738,Watergate Bay Hotel,"A perfect weekend, service & the quality of the experience was excellent. We ate a number of meals over the stay and the quality was superb. A beautiful location, with a very special atmosphere. Special touch of birthday fizz in our room when we arrived. The beach lofts were superb & all made very special by the lovely & very helpful hosts. We will be back!"
2739,Watergate Bay Hotel,"This fabulous hotel has just delivered the most fantastic weekend for our family. The facilities are simply fabulous, restaurants great and the location outstanding! Most of our family flew into Newquay airport which meant from the Midlands, door to door was only 3 and a half hours! We will definately be returning."
2740,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Fabulous hotel , amazing food , people and location .. loved every second of the stay , fantastic pool , such a amazing and kind people work there , stayed in one of the rooms with sea view , so so beautiful..."
2741,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Super dog friendly, lovely living spaces, comfy spacious rooms, staff friendly, welcoming and helpful. Spa facilities also great - sauna, hot tub, pool! Only thing that would make it better would be a proper cold plunge pool instead of the shower as the shower does run luke warm after a while so you can’t properly alternate between hot and cold. Stayed twice now and will 100% stay again. Thanks WBH for a great time!"
2742,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Amazing set up for children and big family groups, right on the beach with really good restaurants. Baby monitors work everywhere which is fantastic and kids club staff and facilities were excellent. The family room had everything we need for a family of four."
2743,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Have now stayed on several occasions, asides from the location- cliff top walks on hotels doorstep, alongside the beach and its caves and rock pools, views for sunsets a selection of other things we appreciate about the hotel. Family suites to stay in - these are large and clean with plenty of storage, our children having a separate room within ours so once they are in bed we can still enjoy being in our hotel room without disturbing them is fantastic as the youngest is too young to be in a separate room. Breakfast is fantastic- the range of options means even an extended stay the offering doesn't get repetitive and of course the waffle maker- huge hit with my 10year old, its lovely to see many of the same friendly staff each time we visit. New Family lounge and games…"
2744,Watergate Bay Hotel,We stay at Watergate every six months as a group of professionals to share ideas and gain inspiration from the beautiful setting as well as get away and have time to think. Recommend highly! What ever the weather - it is ideal.
2745,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Exceptional level of service for every team member. Incredible breakfast, especially the waffle station. Stunning location. Comfortable bedrooms with great showers. It's very nice that you can order from The Living Space menu whilst in the downstairs lounge area."
2746,Watergate Bay Hotel,Beach loft rooms are fabulous as are all the staff we encountered in the hotel. We were only let down by the service and a slight food issue at the beach hut. Would certainly recommend this hotel for short or long stays
2747,Watergate Bay Hotel,"It is an incredible hotel, very family and dog friendly so expect a busy pool on wet days! The pool is stunning and the whole place is very relaxing in a gorgeous location! We loved celebrating there and will definitely be back!"
2748,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Fifth visit and never disappoints. Such a relaxing time with the added bonus of beautiful weather. I also love that in the fridge in the room is a bottle of ACTUAL milk , none of this uht rubbish. Beautiful location, gorgeous cocktails , yummy breakfast which never disappoints, relaxing atmosphere and waking up to the sound of the sea is just perfect! Thank you for a wonderful visit again."
2749,Watergate Bay Hotel,"Just moved to Newquay and house being decorated so having to stay at the hotel. All I can say is wow, staying with a friend/couple and it’s stunning here. Beautiful site and place to visit and eat. Would recommend."
2750,The Francis Hotel,"Moraoccan Butternut Squash Curry🍲 , Smoked Hummus, Deep Fried Ice Cream🍨, Cosmopolitan🍸 -~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ Moroccan Butternut Squash Curry - 4/5 | £11 Smoked Hummus - 2.5/5 | £7 Deep Fried Ice Cream - 4.5/5 | £6 Cosmopolitan - 4/5 ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ Hospitality - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5 ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ Recommendation- Note: 1.

2751,The Francis Hotel,"Stayed for the weekend at The Francis Hotel in November 2022. The room was lovely, quirky, well decorated, comfortable bed and very clean. The bathroom was lovely. Breakfast was excellent both mornings with lots of choice from the menu. Two days parking was available to us and this was very helpful as we planned to walk and use public transport throughout our weekend. The location is excellent for everything in Bath City centre. The staff were all very helpful and polite"
2752,The Francis Hotel,"Visiting from the U.S. we stayed one night in Bath at the Francis. Great stay, quaint rooms, extremely friendly staff- thank you Gems. The concierge carried our heavy luggage up to the room, very helpful. We had two rooms, twin beds pushed together- very comfortable. Parking at this hotel is in the back, very convenient. However, due to stairs access from parking lot luggage should be unloaded on the one way street in front of the hotel. The restaurant at the hotel was excellent. We had Lamb rump, Ox Cheeks, chicken Tagine and a BLT. Everyone was very satisfied with food. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing. wait staff-Andrea very cordial and attentive. I wish we had spent more nights at this hotel."
2753,The Francis Hotel,"I stayed here a few years ago when it was a M Gallery hotel and enjoyed it, so was keen to see how it now fares under the Sutton hotel group. We originally stayed in March but had some niggles with our room. The manager was very understanding and kindly invited us back for another stay which we did last night. We had a superior double room on both occasions which overlooked the car park at the rear. This I felt was better than facing the busy road outside and was very quiet at night. The room was huge and had everything you could want. The bed in particular was extremely comfortable. It seemed to be recently renovated. The mini bar has complementary soft drinks and water, while the nespresso machine comes with pods and biscuits. If you book directly with the hotel…"
2754,The Francis Hotel,"This is the perfect location in Bath. I loved the historic rooms and felt like I was in Georgian England. The staff members were so helpful. Camille, Paige and Gems were all so helpful and left a wonderful impression. Don’t miss out on a mini cream tea in the parlor. I recommended this location to my friend who is visited in April and she loved it too."
2755,The Francis Hotel,"Lovely hotel and rooms. The rooms, including bathrooms, were larger than we typically encounter in Europe. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to from the hotel. The restaurant was nice and we had breakfast there each morning, though our rate didn't include it. It was a little odd as you can either do buffet style or order from the menu, though many of the things you order you just go get from the buffet. Some drinks are brought to you, others you go get yourself. It worked, but it was an odd service flow."
2756,The Francis Hotel,"The Francis Hotel is excellent - lovely to stay in, well appointed, very clean and a perfect location at the centre of Bath. However, the best part of our stay was the staff. The lovely young woman who checked us in overheard that it was our 41st wedding anniversary. When we returned to our room after a stroll around the city we found an unexpected 'congratulations' message, two delicious macarons and a glass of bubbly. We send our thanks to the staff who are very kind and thoughtful - and all their colleagues (bar/housekeeping/restaurant( who were also brilliant. (And I definitely recommend the Shakshuka Eggs for breakfast!) We plan to return regularly - and have already recommended The Francis Hotel to family and friends. Thank you again."
2757,The Francis Hotel,"Delicious afternoon tea. Lovely surroundings, friendly polite waiting staff and delicious food. The jumbo scone lived up to its name, it's huge! The sandwiches and cake were also lovely. It was a very enjoyable challenge to eat it all. Would recommend it."
2758,The Francis Hotel,"Really lovely hotel with a very friendly welcome. Stunning room (super shower!) - was treated to an upgrade due to perks of Booking.com - but (and this was a massive but for me) - I was in room 18 (a random one to find as you go up to 1st floor and then down again). Room 18 was beautiful. I’m not a fan of ground floor rooms - but thought for one night it would be ok. Went to window to check out my view of Barton Street - and there was terrace seating right up against my window! Now the sound proofing was great, and with chilly evening weather the terrace wasn’t in use - so all good for my stay - but I would HATE to be in this position on a busy summers evening. Attached photo is the window from the outside. Felt so so strange and I kept my curtains shut at all times. I’m…"
2759,The Francis Hotel,Very Convenient. The reception service and car parking were good. Breakfast on one morning was chaotic with food coming in the wrong order. Don't seem to cater well for GF people but that might have been because they were so busy. We complained and they apologised and cancelled the car-parking charges. Second morning was better but bedroom shower was poor with no hot water for several minutes. And B&B rates are very expensive for average people. Will look somewhere else next time
2760,The Francis Hotel,"A great base to explore Bath. Close to all the attractions and amenities. Room well appointed with a great shower. Fresh milk and filter coffee are a lovely touch. All staff were friendly and helpful. Appeared a little stretched for staff at breakfast on our first day but it was well worth the wait. High quality ingredients, beautifully presented. Some traffic noise as our room was on the front of the hotel but only to be expected in a city centre location. Will happily return for some Christmas shopping later this year."
2761,The Francis Hotel,"This hotel is so well situated. Bath is on your doorstep. The hotel is beautiful. Stylish, clean, luxurious. The staff were all kind friendly and helpful, the breakfast was first class. I would stay again."
2762,The Francis Hotel,Went for drinks to the Francis as we have done numerous times and will continue to do but so disappointed with the restaurant service. That restaurant will bring the Francis down. It will result in people not using the hotel.
2763,The Francis Hotel,Lovely staff especially Olivia in Reception she was very helpful and efficient. We have just returned from a three night stay which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had a nice quiet room which was very comfortable. All the ladies in Reception were very helpful. We definitely will be back.
2764,The Francis Hotel,"This hotel suited us down to the ground. My sister and I were catching up after a long separation. The hotel provided everything we needed. Brilliant staff to make our stay fun and comfortable, central position right in the middle of Bath right beside the sites, the shopping and great bars and eateries. The hotel had some interesting historical features and the room was a good size. A great stay."
2765,The Francis Hotel,"Hotel is impressive, clean with very welcoming staff! We had lovely views of the city from our room. Location is excellent and we were near lots of great bars and restaurants. Would highly recommend staying as we had a wonderful experience!"
2766,The Francis Hotel,"Lovely find right in the centre of Bath. We were travelling for work and had selected the Francis due to its central location. On arrival the reception staff were friendly, helpful and swift with booking in. The hotel decor was lovely especially in the communal rooms on the ground floor, very stylish, but homely and relaxed. The rooms were spacious, well equipped with both tea and coffee making facilities, refrigerated water provided, hairdryer, ironing board and a great bathroom with powerful shower. The staff were really helpful with directions and recommendations for the local area, plus they provided me with a hot drink before I went to bed, free of charge :-) The breakfast room was a delight, calm, elegant and organised. Breakfast was included in our deal so we enjoyed…"
2767,The Francis Hotel,"Upon arrival the Staff were welcoming and friendly. The ambiance of the hotel is so relaxed and beautifully decorated. The rooms were great and the facilities in the room excellent. We dined in the restaurent Boho Marche on site and have to say that the food was excellent and the restaurant was cosy and the staff so efficient and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff of this hotel,always smiling and always there to help. The location of this hotel to explore bath is Excellent. The main attractions are literally a 5 minute walk away. Highly recommend this hotel."
2768,The Francis Hotel,"Had a dinner, bed and breakfast deal given as a gift and stayed one night. The hotel itself is a little bit quirky. We had a standard double room. The room was tiny but the en-suite was huge with a good walk in shower. The room was clean and heating was set to a good temperature ( often hotels seems to be roasting). There was a caffetiere and fresh milk in the fridge which was better than sachets of instant coffee and those awful cartons of UHT. The walls however were a little thin ….. we didn’t get a lot of sleep due to a couple who were decidedly more amorous than ourselves in the room above. ( and very impressive stamina). They then enjoyed post coital TV for a couple of hours. We were able to park in the hotel car park and leave the car until 2pm the next day which was…"
2769,The Francis Hotel,"We stayed in this fabulous hotel for 2 nights and can only say how great the staff were, especially Camille on reception and Chris in the restaurant. Nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make our stay 'extra special'. The room was very comfortable and loved the extra touch of fresh milk In the fridge. We will definitely be back!"
2770,The Francis Hotel,"We arranged a last minute Afternoon Tea at the Francis Hotel with a group of friends. We we're very grateful that they could accommodate us as they we're quite busy. We had the best service from a young chap called Jake, he was extremely helpful, friendly and polite, nothing was too much trouble. We all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and can't wait to bring more friends back to sample more of the menu. Thanks Again"
2771,The Francis Hotel,"Thank you so much to everyone for a very warm welcome, felt like we were visiting family! We'll definitely come back as this was a very memorable stay, it was great to have our dog by our side. The staff were super friendly towards us and each other, they seem like they are one big family. Despite being a 4 star hotel it definitely deserves 5! Big thank you to Gems, and Camille for greeting us as well as giving us a lovely send off the following day. Hope to see you there again! Kind Regards Anna Greg and Lilly"
2772,The Francis Hotel,"We decided to stay at The Francis Hotel for a weekend away in Bath for our anniversary. Our overall experience was unfortunately underwhelming. First off, we must praise the service and welcome we had from the reception team. They were lovely and very helpful. We paid more than we usually would for a hotel stay for what we thought would be a more luxurious room (Room 213). The room itself was big, but felt dated and generally a bit tired. The floor was on a slant and we felt pretty unsteady walking around. It's very creaky too. Both of these things could have been forgiven (given the age of the building) if the room was of higher quality. In comparison to the size of the bedroom the en suite was pretty tight and compact. There was just a small walk in shower, and no bath,…"
2773,The Francis Hotel,"Stayed here for a couple of nights with my daughter to visit bath. Hotel is very nice, nice room etc. We had problems a couple of times being locked out of the room when the key card didn't work which involved slogging back to the reception several times but eventually sorted. The bar area was nice with a very friendly barman. The big let down was eating in the dining room, we had decided we would eat there both nights of our stay for convenience but, as the experience was very disappointing, only did it the first night. We had tried to book a table for 7.30 but asked to change to 7.45 as they were busy. Well it wasn't - we eventually got our starters just before 9 and I'm afraid when I saw my scallops both my daughter and I burst out laughing. I didn't think it was possible…"
2774,The Francis Hotel,"The location for the hotel was perfect and the staff were fantastic too, the only disappointment was the room we got, me and my partner came down for my birthday and the room we was given was slanted and nothing was flat or straight. The floor was actually on a slant, the bed was on a slant when you laid in it which was disappointing as it was not like the photographs advertised, the price we paid for the room, we was not expecting a room like that. The hotels location is perfect as it so central, it’s ideal. Just the room was a let down for a 4* hotel and the price!"
2775,The Francis Hotel,"What a stay!!! Cannot recommend this hotel enough, I will look forward to returning! Amazing location in the heart of Bath with attentive and friendly staff, the hotel was spottlessly clean with a fantastic atmosphere. Special thanks to Camille, Manuel and the restaurant team for looking after us and making our stay great."
2776,The Francis Hotel,"My folks live in Bath and The Francis Hotel has been one of their favourite places for many years. Recently we came to visit and stayed the night. But during the day we organised drinks before lunch, lunch and then friends to meet us for tea. We were so very looked after, Roxana went over and above to make sure my 92 year old Father and 89 year old mother were having a super time. we felt so lucky to have her looking after us and nothing was too much trouble. We hope you get to see this Roxana and also that the Hotel commend you for your amazing customer service. Thank you too to Camilla. for organising everything for us. My parents had the best day ever!!"
2777,The Francis Hotel,Great location in centre of Bath near all main areas. Excellent service from all staff including restaurant. Good value for money but parking expensive for such small spaces. Very nice Boho themmed restaurant but a bit limited on choice if you are eating there for a number of days.
2778,The Francis Hotel,"Just enjoyed a short stopover break at the Francis Hotel and certainly plan to return for longer in the near future. Arrived in evening and received a great welcome from the receptionist, Camille I believe. Dining reservations, etc sorted I got into my room - spacious, warm, so many amenities and the decor/furnishing was very nice - this is consistent throughout the hotel's bar, lounge and corridors; and the bed was very comfortable. In the evening I dined at their on-site restaurant, Boho Marche, again, excellent service from who I presume to be a supervisor or manager but unfortunately didn't catch her name. The food and drink was very nice (I recommend their 'The Francis' cocktail). Breakfast, choice of continental or cooked, their english breakfast was very nice. …"
2779,The Francis Hotel,"The hotel is on the perfect position town centre, Very nice Hotel clean and friendly staff specialy Adrian and Frankie who make my stay memorable. Receptionist aswell very attentive and helpful.Great food and fantastic staff We will return and recommend to friends and family. Perfect stay Thank you all"
2780,The Francis Hotel,"I stayed at the Francis hotel Mid January, my room was really nice I only had a problem with the tv not being able to cast to it, even though it has the ability to. I really only wanted to write a review because I wanted to give a special shout out to Julia who works in the bar. Julia was super nice, super helpful, super friendly. I feel like she was working so much and kept a smile. Honestly I would pick this hotel again just to have this type of service. So thank you Julia."
2781,The Francis Hotel,"Fabulous December Dinner Out with Friends. Christiana was amazing and looked after us so well, food delicious. We weren't hurried to finish our meals or hurried to leave the premises and everyone was polite, smiling and very obliging. I think people forget that they do not have to be residents of the hotel to dine here. Convenient parking behind the hotel and on street parking available."
2782,The Francis Hotel,"I booked a one night stay to celebrate my wife's birthday, she loves Bath and although we only live an hour away we could relax instead of rushing around by staying overnight. I researched the hotels available and settled on the Francis as they had great reviews was only a 5 minute walk into central Bath and an unbeatable deal called ""Stay & Explore"" which included so many extras I at first thought they had got the pricing wrong! We arrived early so that we could maximise our stay time wise, we parked in the hotel car park which is not very big and would fill up quickly in busy periods, normally £20 per day but, was free with the package. A very warm and professional welcome at Reception and though only 10am,our room was ready. I had upgraded to a Superior room, it was…"
2783,The Francis Hotel,"We booked this hotel at the last minute due to a recommendation and we were not disappointed. The staff and welcome was superb, the food was brilliant and the location is spot on for walking round Bath. The rooms were comfortable too. However the over riding impression is that the staff can not do enough to ensure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable... They all seem to talk a real pride in their jobs."
2784,The Francis Hotel,"Booked for my son's 9th birthday great location.Welcoming staff the room was nice and cozy.We had amazing lunch in the restaurant, the hotel is decorated lovely.would definitely recommend.Thank you for the great hospitality."
2785,The Francis Hotel,"We were welcomed by a young male receptionist who could not have been more helpful, professional or friendly - we regret we didn't write down his name. The ONLY slight disappointment - having upgraded to a Feature Room, there was no bath - so we reverted to the Superior room which was more than fine and £25 a night less. Our bed was very comfortable - including the pillows. When I stay at most other hotels I wish I'd brought my own - my wife is more tolerant :o)! Quietness in a hotel room is very important to us - despite it being quite busy; we heard no transmission of TV noise, no noise along the corridors and only occasional traffic noise - we were on the top floor though. Nice rain shower over the bath, quality smellies. The hotel's location was also top-notch being very…"
2786,The Francis Hotel,"Hotel still living off old reputation, but losing a little polish for the class of hotel. Staff great. Food great. Location great. Rooms quite standard, tv channels basic Freeview. No individual toiletries but basic bulk refil bottles Standard domestic in room kettle that doesn’t fit under the sink taps No luggage service so negotiating the 3 flights of stairs from the car park difficult It’s all in the detail for this class of hotel . The details left me disappointed."
2787,The Francis Hotel,"The hotel is very beautiful and centrally located with easy access to all important tourist spots and bus stops. The Roman Baths is just few minutes walking from the hotel. Infact all the historical spots are just within walking distance of the hotel. Ample eating options are there nearby. The hotel itself has a restaurant, a tea room and a bar. We stayed at Classic double room, the room looked very beautiful with a touch of elegant furnishings inside. The hotel has an historic significance. Special mention of Tali at the front desk who was very pleasant and helpful and did a swift and efficient check-in process. She was very caring and welcomed the guests with a warm smile always."
2788,The Francis Hotel,"Wonderful stay! Would definitely recommend. Location was ideal.Staff were lovely and friendly. Dinner was delicious- with excellent service. Would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be right in the centre of Bath. Shops, theatre and loads nearby."
2789,The Francis Hotel,"We have just returned from a wonderful two night stay celebrating my daughter’s birthday at the Francis Hotel. We received a lovely birthday gift and note in the room from the team. Everyone was very friendly and looked after us so well. The food was amazing, thank you to the chefs. The hotel is in such a fantastic location in this beautiful city. We will definitely return!"
2790,The Francis Hotel,"We spent two nights here to see the Christmas market and Bath itself. After seeing all the car park full signs it was a real plus to see the Hotel had its own barriered car park. We received a warm welcome. The hotel was very clean and had lovely decorations up, which made it look very impressive and welcoming when walking back to it in the dark from the town centre.. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. Being so old the floor was very creaky. Our room faced the front and was at times a little noisy. But that is perhaps the trade off for being in such an excellent location, just a couple of minutes to either the town centre or the Crescent. The only meals we had were breakfasts and they were excellent."
2791,The Francis Hotel,Another lovely stay at the Francis for the Christmas markets. The staff are all fantastic and very helpful couldn't fault any of them. We stayed in a feature room with a separate sitting area Rm 109 its a great room at the rear of the hotel but if you're a light sleeper you might hear the background music in the bar below. There's also a spearker in the garden area which we asked them to turn off. Overall this didn't spoil our stay and we're looking forward to returning next year.
2792,The Francis Hotel,"The Francis is a beautiful hotel. The staff were amazing, particularly Camille and Emily at reception (Emily went to get me some medicine for my child late at night!) and in the Restaurant Andrea, Cain and Manuel. and James, the manager ensured that everything was ok. The location is perfect and the decor is beautiful. The room could have done with a larger closet and since we paid extra for a period room, we expected to have a bath instead of a shower, which was disappointing. The cleaning service in the room was below standard one day and the restaurant was a bit chaotic at times but the food was fantastic and the staff super helpful."
2793,The Francis Hotel,Brilliant hotel but very noisy room. We booked three rooms-one on ground floor which was fine and two on the third floor-301+306. The room itself was great-very comfortable and decorated very nicely as was the hotel itself. Ground coffee and fresh milk was provided which I was impressed with. The toiletries were great too and I bought some of the body wash for my husbands stocking as he liked it so much. The problem was that there was either a generator or air conditioning units making a deafening noise all evening and throughout the night which meant that our friends in 301 and us in 306 got very little sleep. We rang reception twice but no answer. We mentioned the problem when we checked out and the very pleasant young lady was apologetic and offered us a complimentary drink…
2794,The Francis Hotel,A wonderfully elegant hotel with amazing staff and gorgeous rooms. However our stay as a group of 40 people staying for two nights was blighted by our experience in the restaurant. Breakfast was OK but buffet very limited (better choice on our recent visit to a beefeater) Cooked breakfast ok but fried eggs were cold. Evening meal was really a let down our menus didn't accurately describe dishes ie what sauces and what else accompanied the dishes . However it was the service that was the problem. We sat down at 6.30 and got up again at 9 pm we waited approx 20 mins between courses on the first night the food when it came was fine. On the second night we waited longer upto 40 minutes between courses.! When the food came some parts of the meals were cold. They are obviously…
2795,The Francis Hotel,"Beautiful looking hotel and all the staff were very helpful and friendly. Negative points were that the room I had (216) was extremely snail and also the floor was uneven. Food was lovely albeit but much choice on the breakfast menu. Hoaxer, if you’re looking for a tradition looking Bath hotel this fits the bill."
2796,The Francis Hotel,"Fabulous hotel. Very clean, beautifully decorated. So cosy and comfortable. Reception, lounge and bar very inviting. Staff exceptional. Christmas decorations outstanding. Room was lovely, plenty of space, tea coffee, biscuits and water supplied. Fabulous over bath shower and great complementary essentials. Large comfortable beds. Overall a fabulous stay. One negative, we were unable to turn the heating on when the temperature dropped in the evening/night but didn't spoil our stay. Will definitely return."
2797,The Francis Hotel,"You pay a small penalty for staying in this beautiful Nash terraced building in Bath in that it wasn't built as a hotel but is an amalgamation of about four separate houses. For people who do not like modern characterless hotels this is the answer. It is full of character and, at the same time, a very comfortable hotel. The rooms are very spacious with very comfortable beds and the facilities are generally excellent with very obliging staff and an absolutely excellent concierge, who will find anything you want. I have now stayed there twice and would certainly go again. Highly recommended!"
2798,The Francis Hotel,"This hotel is one full of character and Charm and is one of the many reasons we keep coming back. Bath is a stunning city and is great for a relaxing getaway every once in a while. Reception team are fantastic (always have been) but they get better and better each time we visit. We love that this is the second time a linen porter ( or housekeeper) has helped with luggage for us which is outside of their daily duties - I think his name was Kenneth? Thank you! And breakfast is one that I always look forward to - Moroccan eggs Royal is simply yummy. It's like a home from home and we are always made to feel extremely welcome. Big thank you to Paige she always says hello even if we catch her outside of work which we appreciate- and also a big thank you to Paul, Kenneth and christi -…"
2799,The Francis Hotel,Room 223 - room so hot and stuffy and hissing pipes kept us awake all night. Room is at front of hotel and really noisy and horrible with emergency service vehicles throughout the night. Asked to be moved at 3.30am Was moved to room 31 at the back of the hotel. The night porter had tried to enter room 29 where someone was asleep and woke them ! 5.30sm woke to glass crashing into bins outside - reception tried to say it was the council who did this at that time of the morning Was given a complimentary breakfast and refunded on the £20 car parking but still had to pay for £166 for a night of no sleep !!!!!! Will not be returning
2800,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"We hosted a charity ball at The Coal Exchange and would highly recommend the venue to anyone thinking of organising a similar event. The grand hall is beautiful, the food was delicious and the staff were incredibly professional and helpful!"
2801,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"It was disappointing that our room contained zero information about the history of the hotel, or any information about the hotel at all. In fact, there is no information about the hotel in the public areas. Very odd because a good number of guests, like us, must come because of the history of the building. The management could take a leaf from the Telegraph Hotel in Coventry. Worst however was that there was no hot water in our room (237). We were told by reception to let the water run for 15 minutes! This only produced warm water and is incredibly wasteful for the environment. Worst of all was the black mould all round the bath. Really unforgivable. The jacuzzi bath was a bit odd in the context of a Victorian hotel. A proper shower and hot water should be the priority. In…"
2802,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,A beautiful hotel with stunning rooms! The staff were friendly and breakfast was fantastic!! The bath tub was a delight with jacuzzi the bed was super comfortable! The decor and was lovely and the room we stayed at was incredible! I wish I could rate it higher
2803,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,This is a grand old hotel. The ballroom and dining rooms are so elegant. Our room was so spacious and beautifully decorated. The staff was very friendly and so helpful with their suggestions. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.
2804,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Spent 2 fantastic nights at this stunning building for my sisters wedding! The hotel were so accommodating for our every need. Special thanks to hotel manager Brian. Food at the wedding provided by Duchess of Delhi in the Bay was incredible!
2805,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"I’ve worked in hospitality for a considerable time now as a Reception Supervisor, I attended a friends wedding on the 31st of May, from the moment I arrived at the hotel until the moment I left on the 1st the hotel staff have been so respectful and the most accommodating, they really couldn’t have done enough! The chef for the wedding was from Duchess of Delhi in the bay and provided the most exquisite and most beautiful food with such a huge variety of dishes! The rooms are extremely beautiful and decorated perfectly in line with the age of the building! Thank you so much to all the staff and the GM Brian at The Coal Exchange for getting everything so perfect!!"
2806,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Wow. Do NOT stay at this hotel. It is a seedy, half-renovated, creepy labyrinth of good intentions and horrible decorating. If you find the way to your room (the guy at the front desk had to lead us to ours), you may never find your way back out again. All the hallways are scary dark until you step into them. Then the lights come on. And the neighborhood is very run-down and disturbing. I could go on. I don't know where all the glowing reviews are coming from. But do yourself a favor and stay away. Far away."
2807,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"The stay was good with friendly reception and kitchen staff but was completely spoilt by a rude and argumentative cleaner who ordered us out of the room when we were informed that special arrangements had been made for us to stay an hour longer before checking out. This would not be enough alone for me to write a bad review but for the terrible attitude of the owner when my wife went to politely raise the issue on reception, the owner intervened berating my wife accusing her of being aggressive with his member of staff. This was not true and he made no attempt to establish the facts. He was up close in my wife’s face and pointing his finger. If that’s his idea of customer care then I don’t think hospitality is his thing and he should leave these things to a manager. As I said…"
2808,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Attended a family wedding, Beautiful venue, staff were so welcoming and friendly, especially Michaela in reception, Becky on catering, & Chris on bar! Amazing experience, nothing was too much trouble. Definitely recommend and can’t wait to come back"
2809,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We came in after a long bus ride from London (was supposed to be a train ride) so we were frazzled. All the staff were terrific but the front desk staff were wonderful and so helpful! Room was a decent size - clean and great looking with a good bathroom - and the hotel puts out a good breakfast. We left before the restaurant opened and were able to get to-go breakfasts. Location is perfect - easy walk to Cardiff Bay and only a couple miles from Cardiff Castle and the core shopping/eating area. Building is stunning and very much in demand - we were there for two nights and the first they had a sponsored wine tasting and the second was a charity gala - both were very well attended by local people.
2810,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Such a beautiful old historic hotel that has been restored beautifully. We had the best check-in and out best service. A Welsh friend travelling with me assured it was a great Welsh breakfast as well. I would absolutely go back again.
2811,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Lovely staff and room was also just right but unfortunately when I checked in I was told the restaurant and bar was out of use due to a private function (this was a Monday night) but assured I could use room service. After a few hours of being out in the evening I came back and ordered room service at 8pm only to have an email 5 mins later to say my order was rejected as kitchen was too busy. Tried again 10 mins later and same happens by which point is was 8.30pm and too late for me to want to go out again. Hence no dinner for me that night….Such a shame it spoiled the trip and I had been looking forward to trying out the restaurant especially as breakfast the next morning was so good. Why allow people to book rooms if you can’t offer food? Also maybe ensure staff on reception…
2812,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"A but querky but a really enjoyable stay. This old building gives a different experience. Located as close to the Bay as you can get and at reasonable cost. Breakfast was very good. Do ask the chef to cook poached eggs. He's a master. David, the manager, and all his staff will attend to your every needs within reason. More than happy to stay there again."
2813,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Firstly the hotel itself and the rooms are beautiful, there is a rustic charm about it. Beds lovely and comfy and fantastic bathrooms. But the staff were lovely and helpful when we needed to change the beds in our room. Daniel the manager was extremely friendly. Would 100% recommend a stay here."
2814,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"A beautiful building steeped in history. The location is perfect for either Cardiff Bay or a short walk unto the city centre. We booked a standard double room. Very spacious, comfy beds and spotless. The bathroom had a jacuzzi bath and rain shower. Breakfast was good quality and plenty of choice. Very friendly reception staff, and breakfast host. I would highly recommend"
2815,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Amazing - the large jacuzzi baths are so good, I didn’t want to leave! Lovely meal in the restaurant, the lamb pasta starter was especially good. Special thanks to David Lecoq who was very helpful. We will definitely be going back!"
2816,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"We stayed for an overnight stay to watch a show at the millenium centre it was a 5min walk to this and the bay where we had food. Room was lovely for three of us(2 adults 1 child) lovely big bath with ammenities and good tea facilities. Beds were super comfy. The only things would be as the placement of the beds,it woud be good to be able to rotate the tv. It is an old building so we could hear alot of the outside noice...but not much can be done about that. The main thing is parking... where the hotel is placed,the walk from the bay to the hotel is slightly scary with the lanes,people outside the building,especially with a little one,maybe an evening taxi service for shows would be good. Overall it was fun would stay again."
2817,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Booking for 80 rooms and a gala awards dinner and drink reception for 205 people. Well what an amazing experience. Good first class - had diamond menu - was consistently great. Staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for us. The main hall - no where with more history or ambience. The whole experience from organising - Michell you were brilliant - through to delivery where all staff were equally fantastic. We will be back.
2818,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Hotel was fabulous. So much history. What a plus for Cardiff. Manager and staff were great and offered any help we needed. Room was unique. Period touches but all the mod cons. Bed was very comfortable. Bed linen and towels perfect. Room even had a Spa bath. Irish cooked breakfast was a terrific end to a great stay.
2819,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"A very mixed experience staying at the Coal Exchange. It is a wonderful old building, steeped in history. There was good regard for this on its transformation to a hotel. It is dark and moody but certainly has a charm. Sadly we were let down by several things. The lift was a very long walk and although the first person we saw at check-in really did try to help, there was little that could be done, so be aware if you have mobility issues. Our room was a king size and the shower amazing, bed good, although the sheet did not fit so couldn't be tucked in. The decor was hideous. Lime green padded wall behind the bed, bold wall paper with green palms design and large floral curtains, nothing complimented each other, in fact fought against each other and not relaxing at all. The…"
2820,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Had a great stay, we went to the hair and beauty awards. We had a double room with a massive spa bath. The room was really clean and tidy. The breakfast was great. The staff were very friendly, James staff member was amazing and really went above and beyond, James helped us discover the local area and what attractions to visit."
2821,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Booked the presidential suite, it included prosecco, afternoon tea and breakfast. Room had whirlpool bath with rainfall shower. Staff were friendly and very helpful, especially James on reception who checked us in and out. Looking forward to our next visit and will recommend."
2822,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Absolutely amazing stay at this hotel for the social media hair and beauty awards. The front desk staff were really helpful and friendly straight away on arrival. I have a gluten and diary allergy and I was catered for above and beyond at the hotel. I have to shout out one of the amazing waitress/front of house in the hotel restaurant, I didn't get her name. She was extremely accommodating for my food allergies and I always struggle when I am away from home. So to come to a place where its absolutely no problem was incredible. The best part was the jacuzzi bath in the room.. Absolute heaven!"
2823,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Had booked the rest and revive package. Prosecco on arrival. Afternoon tea was delicious. Whirlpool bath was brilliant. Staff could not have been more helpful especially James at reception for an easy check in and check out. Would recommend the coal exchange to anyone looking for a relaxing night away.
2824,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We have just arrived from what can only be described as a brilliant night here for my sisters hen weekend. The service was excellent! David the hotel Manager went above and beyond to cater for our large parties needs. The rooms were lovely and comfortable. Brunch at Culleys the in house restaurant was delicious. A 2 minute walk from the bay and close to bars and other food eateries. Will 100% be returning and would very much recommend!
2825,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Beautiful historic building, stayed in the presidential suite - what a room! Absolutely stunning. Staff really warm and friendly. All the personal touches and feeling of a small B&B within the luxury of a big hotel. Dinner and Breakfast in Culley's kitchen exceptional."
2826,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Great service particularly from the manager, great location for bay. Easy uber to town. Standard buffet breakfast, nice but not great. Occasionally noisy due to period windows and building 150 years old. The room was large but only a double bed which wasn’t the comfiest. Mid week reduced price. All in all i would stay again, particularly for the bath"
2827,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Amazing individual rooms ours was dedicated to Roald Dahl’s dad and had a jacuzzi. Great service, very friendly reception staff. Lots of history about the building itself. We really enjoyed our stay. Will definitely go back. Easy access into Cardiff and the waterfront."
2828,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"This hotel is absolutely beautiful, one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in and well without doubt stay there again. The staff where fantastic and could not have been more willing to help whenever we asked for anything. The rooms were spaciuos ane clean and the bathroom was lovely. Breakfast was fantastic and very hot and fresh. Its a 6 minute walk to cardiff batmy and around 20 minute walk to the city center, there is also a train station 5 minutes from the hotel to talk you into town. Overall i cannot reccomand this hotel enough."
2829,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,Excellent stay at the Coal Exchange which is an amazing location with a great atmosphere. The staff was helpful and kind. From the hotel it is a short walk to the bustling waterfront with plenty of food and drink opportunities. Having said that we do insist that you dine at the restaurant in the Coal Exchange which we highly recommend. 😊

2831,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We stayed one night at this beautiful hotel and found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast was tasty and fresh. It was a great location close to the bay and all the bars restaurants and entertainment there. We have already booked again for a night in December!
2832,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"I loved my visit to the Coal Exchange Hotel. The old world meets new has been tastefully executed. The building has been renovated with modern facilities and lovely bright colours in the rooms, juxtaposed with the dark wood furniture makes for a classy, atmospheric experience. The towels were abundant, snow white and fluffy, the bed was huge and comfortable. I was able to leave my luggage as i arrived too early for check in which was great to be able to offload the suitcase and take a stroll to the Cardiff Bay area. There are loads of restaurants, cafes and a beautiful seafront walk within 5 mins of the hotel. I can't wait to come back and visit again. Taxi from train station is about 5 min ride and costs around 8£."
2833,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Just returned from the midweek package, the staff are so happy and attentive. There is so much to take in from the decor. Room was spacious especially the large jacuzzi bath. Lunch and breakfast 100% enjoyable! Pop in for a cocktail and see for yourself 😃"
2834,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We had an excellent stay at the Coal Exchange. Staff were so welcoming and helpful when we checked in. Rooms were very comfortable clean and well presented. Breakfast was also lovely. We stayed with a group of friends.Look forward to another visit soon
2835,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,A gem of a hotel tucked away behind the main road with excellent and really helpful staff. The drop off turning circle is very welcome in the (frequent) rain of Cardiff and the restaurant and function areas are an amazing reminder of the history of this renovated old building. Thank you to David and his team!
2836,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"out trip started off with a lovely friendly welcome from reception staff and we were escorted to our room. The aesthetics of the hotel are stunning it was lovely to see it original features. We stayed at the presidential suite and honestly it’s possibly one of the best rooms we’ve ever stayed in, The double spa bath was gorgeous and I think we both enjoyed being able to have a giant bath to ourselves without our kids wanting to share with us. Bed was comfortable however I think I would enjoy a different pillow. Like the Mitre Countess ones. Overall we had an amazing time and we look forward to staying again and trying out all the super fancy rooms when we can escape our children"
2837,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Nothing I can fault with this hotel everything and every member of staf is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ my favourite hotel in Cardiff the food, atmosphere room and staff truly amazing I am always gutted when it is time to check out I never want to leave"
2838,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Fabulous hotel! This is our second stay and we have said we'll be back any time we're in Cardiff. (We come down from the NE at least twice most years for rugby - as well as for theatre at the Millennium centre) Staff couldn't be more helpful, pleasant & friendly. Rooms are comfortable and quirky with information about the companies that were based in the building. It's an old building which gives it character - don't expect straight lines and square rooms! Breakfast has always been excellent with a great choice and this time we had dinner too. Something for everyone and the min dessert of Bara Brith bonbons with a rum and raison custard was inspired! Good local beer too. No parking on site but you can at least drop off luggage before finding a car park. Q Park…"
2839,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Our second visit to this fabulous hotel! From the moment you walk in the door to the moment you leave, you are made to feel welcome! The hotel, as a grand part of Cardiff Bay's history, is beautiful and the rooms are well furnished and decorated. We did find the room a bit warm this weekend, but could just be my age! An issue with the TV was sorted quickly with laughter had by all. The breakfast buffet has a great choice & we were able to eat very heartily and heathily! The customer service is second to none, with a quick Whatsapp message from the bus from town delaying our evening restaurant booking by 30mins as the traffic and weather was horrendous and we were very wet when we finally arrived. Refreshed and changed into dry clothes, we had a wonderful meal in Culley's…"
2840,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We really enjoyed our stay in the coal exchange again! The staff are always very welcoming and informative. Our room was spotless and the jacuzzi bath is always an added bonus. Was super quiet in the night we felt like the only people in the hotel. Easy check in and check out! We can’t wait to come again thank you so much x
2841,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We love this hotel. Our second visit and it’s full of character. Lovely wood panels. Beds are comfy. Spa bath amazing. Helpful staff and a good breakfast . Thank you 🙏 lovely location with the Q park and Millennium stadium within a short distance.
2842,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We have been staying at the coal exchange to celebrate special events for over two years now and still fall in love with every-time. It’s a lovely place to stay and is full of such friendly staff that constantly go out of their way to make sure your stay is pleasant. Rooms are extremely comfortable and full of everything you need. The restaurant attached is also a great place to dine and wine. I honestly couldn’t fault this place. It’s amazing!
2843,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"The hotel is beautiful, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. My partner has lots of allergies and they made sure they took every effort in making sure he could eat safely!

Will definitely stay again!!"
2844,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"Very warm and professional welcome, everything was prepared for a quick check in. My room was very spacious and comfortable décor was interesting but pleasing.

2845,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,One night stay for a trip to theatre brilliant location central but quiet and relaxing Very attentive and welcoming staff throughout our stay room spacious and comfortable and very quiet will be back again
2846,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,One of many regular stays at this charismatic hotel full of history and charm. That is one of the things that keep us going back for more but the other thing is the five star service from the staff who can never do enough to make you feel welcome and fulfil all your needs and requests. I’ve said it before but the service here knocks spots off the Celtic Manor it’s not fake or put on it’s a genuine love of their job and the beautiful building they work in. And to top it all off the breakfast is out of this world
2847,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,An absolutely beautiful hotel inside and out and the staff were friendly and helpful and amazing rooms with the best bath you and your partner will ever share. Car parking is less than a 5 minute walk away. Lots of places very close by to go eat and drink.
2848,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,"The hotel is a charming renovated historic building. We booked room 134 which had 3 king beds and also a jacuzzi. A breakfast buffet was included with our room. The location was away from city center and points of interest. We enjoyed eating at Culley’s, the hotel restaurant."
2849,The Coal Exchange Hotel Cardiff,We found all staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was very spacious and comfortable and the en-suite bathroom included a large jacuzzi bath. We had a lovely evening meal and breakfast in Cully's Kitchen Bar and again the staff were very attentive. The location of the hotel is excellent for visiting Cardiff Bay and the Millenium Centre. There is no onsite parking but we parked in Q-Parking opposite the Millenium Centre approximately 350 metres away at a cost of £15 for 24 hours. We'll definitely be going back.
2850,Tynedale Hotel,I can't speak highly enough about this hotel. It is one of the nicest we have ever stayed in. The location was perfect. The hotel was beautifully appointed and every single member of staff was so friendly-they went out of their way to look after you. The room we had was amazing. We will be back. Dominic and Fiona McGinn

2852,Tynedale Hotel,"Another perfect 5 night break at The Tynedale. Tracey and Nathan, congratulations to you and all your amazing staff, on your latest award. Very richly deserved. Absolutely every aspect of staying at The Tynedale is perfect. Our room, the view, the public areas, the entertainment, (favourites Morgan and Al) selection and quality, and presentation, of food. Restaurant and bar service are second to none. The crowning glory is the quality of the staff. They are friendly, incredibly hardworking, efficient and always helpful. I am grateful to those who pander to my small appetite and always feeling cold. It will be a sad day when we can no longer visit four or five times a year. Previous tips to book early are spot on. This place is seriously in demand. Thank you to everyone, your…"

2863,Tynedale Hotel,"Just returned from another wonderful stay at this excellent hotel and already looking forward to another visit in August. From arrival to departure nothing can be faulted - the public rooms are all decorated and furnished to a high standard and our bedroom (the junior suite) was super spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was the best and the evening dinner, in the super modern restaurant, was delicious with a great choice. Also the entertainment each evening was very enjoyable. All the staff were really efficient, attentive and very friendly in all areas. The owners Nathan and Tracy are always on site and lead by example, being involved with the general running of the hotel. Can’t wait for our next visit."
2864,Tynedale Hotel,"We arrived at the Tynsdale with a couple of friends .Our stay was for 3 nights. This hotel is faultless. Service at dinner outstanding. Staff attentive. I wish to comment on the entertainment. Our first night was excellent with Tidur singing and telling jokes. Sunday night he played country and western songs. Welsh, Irish, Jim Reeves. He is a man that makes the crowd laugh. It's nice to hear country and western music at the hotel. Monday, Morgan Reeves is a professional Baritone singer who has studied music. He is a baritone singer. I would highly recommend this hotel. Very difficult to book in as the coaches take the rooms for coach parties Thank all the staff for their professionalism. You have got the service,, the ambiance spot on."
2865,Tynedale Hotel,"The Tyndale is a lovely stylish hotel with friendly staff , excellent food and entertainment . The sea front location offers stunning views , making it great place to stay , we can not wait to go back ."

2867,Tynedale Hotel,"We have been coming to Llandudno twice a year for a long long time and we stay somewhere different each time - this is not only the best hotel we have stayed in while in Llandudno but one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in anywhere! Really clean and comfortable - room was lovely, entertainment was good fun, breakfast was fantastic, the seating area for drinks out the front is absolutely perfect and is such a perfect spot to relax and have a drink. Hotel staff are so welcoming and helpful too. Would highly recommend and we will definitely be coming again next year and looking forward to it!"

2869,Tynedale Hotel,"Spent 2 nights at the Tynedale which is in a good location on the Promenade and near the town centre. Breakfasts were very good as were the evening meals. Being a coach tour favourite there was 'entertainment' in the bar at night but the acts may not all be to everyones taste. 1 we thought read the room well and respnded with what the audience wanted, the second though didn't do nearly as well and like several others, we voted with our feet and went to a quieter room. One other niggle was the wifi which kept dropping the signal on all our devices. It was reported to reception but hadn't been resolved when we left."
2870,Tynedale Hotel,Our stay at the Tynedale Llandudno was once again excellent good food clean room with a sea view we had a lovely weekend for the May bank holiday extravaganza weekend would definitely recommend this hotel
2871,Tynedale Hotel,Best Hotel by far from start to finish first class staff helpfull an always happy to help would recommend this hotel highly great entertainment luxury rooms and surroundings can't wait to go back

2874,Tynedale Hotel,A very comfortable one night solo stay in a hotel where everyone with whom I came in contact made me feel welcome. My room was well furnished with items that made the best use of space and it was spotlessly clean. I would stay there again and recommend it.
2875,Tynedale Hotel,"Just got home from the Tynedale Hotel, Llandudno, after staying there for the Victorian Extravaganza weekend 2023. This hotel is the best in Llandudno, we couldn't fault any aspect of our stay. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, the staff very friendly, nothing was too much trouble, and the food was delicious. There was entertainment every night and we especially enjoyed the 'Celtic Cowboy, Tudur. He sang a wide variety of music and had a very gentle, friendly act. Loved it from the minute we walked in until we left this morning."
2876,Tynedale Hotel,"My husband and I have just spent 4 nights with you for our 54th wedding anniversary and couldn't have had a more enjoyable stay.From stepping in the front door the decor is outstanding.Every little detail is thought out.Our bedroom was very comfortable with everything in it you could wish for.The food was delicious,especially the nightly dinners ,with an excellent choice of menu..Your staff know how to make you feel an individual guest which goes a long way.Thank you all for a wonderful stay.We look forward to coming again."

2881,Tynedale Hotel,"Had a lovely stay at this hotel and would highly recommend. The decor was really nice. Really good breakfast with plenty of choice. We had evening meal in the dinning room, and it was just as nice as going to a restaurant. Excellent service, the staff were all really friendly and helpful. There is entertainment every evening and on Saturday night we had the added bonus of the local welsh men’s choir. There is an outdoor seating area over looking the promenade where we were able to fit and relax with a drink."
2882,Tynedale Hotel,"My sister and I went on a coach trip, Elite Travel, from Chelmsford for the Landlubbers Cruise at the Tynedale Hotel. Amazing staff, Captain Nathan and all his crew made the experience memorable. Breakfast sets you up for the day, afternoon tea if you really must and dinner with local ingredients. Words cannot express how wonderful the hotel is. Can’t wait to go back. Llandudno and the Tynedale Hotel will be my go to place. We had single rooms, lovely and quiet, everything you would need. Any issues resolved on the spot.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

The staff were really friendly and extremely helpful, breakfast was great with many options including pancakes and traditional English, (and again, lovely staff all working very hard to make it a nice experience) and rooms were really nice. The hotel has a small car park in which we were able to get a space, which was a real boon."
2886,Tynedale Hotel,"Lovely Junior Suite Room 102,spotlessly clean ( and I'm a clean freak) comfortable and safe. Would recommend to friends, will visit again. Breakfast - great. Plenty of choice. Staff throughout - 100%. Location - perfect. Seaviews. Close to shops and Promenade. Flat, accessible."
2887,Tynedale Hotel,"The best hotel I've been in for many years, staff were very friendly and professional, efficient & polite, they couldn't do enough for you, entertainment was excellent, food, especially breakfast was outstanding. The hotel itself was modern, very clean and well equipped, will definitely go back"

2889,Tynedale Hotel,"Great hotel in great location. Every member of staff we spoke to was very helpful and professional. Hotel was clean and well maintained. Evening meal and breakfast were of a very good standard and were brought out at very busy times very quickly. Room was very well equipped and clean. The only issue was our room (40 - a suite) was so hot in the night that we woke up in a sweat. Radiators were off, so no idea where the heat was coming from. Had to open the windows for the rest of the night and put the fan on."
2890,Tynedale Hotel,"Outstanding hotel, friendly staff, and amazing food x Nathan and the team have certainly thought of everything at the Tynedale, they are a friendly and vibrant team who make everyone feel welcome. The rooms are beautifully decorated and well-equipped, they have everything you need including tea and coffee-making facilities and an en suite which is finished to a high standard. The food was simply amazing, we had dinner and all three courses were equally as good. Breakfast was delicious and the service was quick and efficient. Really couldn't fault the hotel - the staff were all hospitable, welcoming, friendly, and helpful and they made my mum's birthday extra special. Thank you to everyone - we would thoroughly recommend the hotel - you would not be disappointed !!!"
2891,Tynedale Hotel,"Our first visit to the tynedale 10/10 just wow,the break from joining the bus to home amazing This hotel is incredible in every single department The food choice amazing The entertainment was different every night When morgan was on a guest thought she was clever to try and pull the evening down , if only he was allowed to react back the way she was Morgan you were fabulous 👏👏 Will definitelyreturn"
2892,Tynedale Hotel,"Just returned from a Landlubbers Cruise, Room 21. Our room was, as always, beautifully presented with everything we could need and spotlessly clean, thank you Hanna. Our first day we were in France The following day we berthed in Mexico and Hawaii on Day 3, and, our final day was in Italy. The dinner menu choices reflected the country we were visiting as did the dress code for the brilliant restaurant staff. The food is always excellent, hot and nicely presented and no long waits as the staff are eager to attend to your every need. Dining in The Tynedale restaurant is a pleasure indeed. Entertainment was good with Morgan going down a treat. Many of the guests enjoyed their nightly bingo, especially when Brooke was running it. She is so natural, funny, and engages with the…"
2893,Tynedale Hotel,The junior suite is beautifully decorated and very comfortable . We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. All the staff were really helpful. Spotless throughout the hotel. Really good position in the town too.
2894,Tynedale Hotel,"Another fabulous stay in this lovely hotel! We stayed in the junior suite which is at the rear of hotel and suits us perfectly, as it is roomy and h as a cute little patio! We surprised our friends (who we reccomended the hotel to, for a special birthday) and they loved it just as much! The staff are absolutely fabulous, so happy and welcoming in all areas of hotel, food is second to none! Breakfast choices are the best I've ever had in a hotel, all specially cooked to order and beautiful. Highly recommended, and am looking to return soon! Thank you Tynedale 😊"
2895,Tynedale Hotel,"Fantastic hotel based right on the promenade. Lovely sea views from our room. Parking rear of hotel is a God send in Llandudno. Extremely helpful and friendly staff, cannot fault the customer service. Breakfast was first class with plenty of choice. We had a light lunch with a drink from the bar, also top notch. Cannot fault this place, our second visit and definitely not our last. Having visited many b&b's/hotels in Llandudno over the years this is the only one we will stay at now. Highly recommended."
2896,Tynedale Hotel,Super hotel. Spotlessly clean throughout. Excellent food plus great restaurants close by if fancy a change. Very comfortable room with sea view. Wonderful staff that do all they can to make ones stay special. My only regret is that I only booked two nights. I will return for sure. Highly recommended. One tip for you......don't bother with the car park at the rear. It is very small and if you can get in you run the risk of being blocked. Park on the prom at the front. 4pm to 10am is free. 10am to 4pm will cost you £3.70......not greedy and much better.
2897,Tynedale Hotel,"We have stayed at the Tynedale several times and it has always been excellent. The staff are very pleasant, helpful and they work hard. The food is very good with several choices on the menu. The Junior suite was well appointed, clean and pleasant."

2899,Tynedale Hotel,"A rather belated review of our 8 night stay taking in Christmas and Twixmas. A very warm welcome, as always, on check in and an excellent lunch whilst waiting for our room to be ready. Our room was spotless, thank you Hanna, and there was our sweeping view of the sea and the two Ormes. Everything we needed to be comfortable had been thought of plus it was nice and warm. The food offered throughout our stay was of the highest quality, beautifully presented and restaurant service faultless, as usual. Entertainment was very varied and a special mention of Al and Morgan, both of whom are outstanding. The public areas are stylish and comfortable and everyone was so friendly it made for a great Christmas spirit. We love the coach parties, who are always friendly. All the staff at The…"
2900,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Extremely expensive, not clean properly and needs modern touches. Location fabulous but for the price you’d expect better. The bathroom and room facilities are nice but when things like the toilet and glass services are dirty upon arrival it is difficult to see past these things. Even after stayover service the room hadn’t been cleaned properly which was more disappointing."
2901,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Great stay overall. Location ideal for Edinburgh touring and great value. great bar service and restaurant menu. Breakfast was included with my reservation, but the availability and presentation of certain menu items was a bit spotty. Overall, a great hotel experience."
2902,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Just stayed at the Apex Waterloo in Edinburgh - deluxe room with king bed - for 5 nights on a business trip and overall was a great experience. Room was very spacious with tall ceiling and bed/linen were very comfortable. Check-in was easy and the hotel is conveniently across the street from Gym Group, which has day passes and was great for morning workouts. Didn’t have a chance to try the bar or restaurant but based on the room itself and location of the hotel, would definitely stay again."
2903,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Cannot fault this excellent hotel in a perfect central location - (5 minute easy walk from the railway station) - Spotlessly clean everywhere - lovely well-planned room with both bath and separate shower - superb breakfasts - great pool and spa facility - friendly efficient staff.
2904,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Breilliant stay staff very friendly and professional and more importantly human and caring to ensure my stay was confortable. Certainly will come back and stay again when visiting Edinburgh or any other Apex hotel in another city
2905,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,My wife and I stayed over for one night and cannot fault anything with our time at this hotel. Our check in and check out were smooth and the reception staff are all super friendly. The same can be said for the bar and the restaurant staff. We had breakfast and the choice was wonderful and cooked perfectly. Our room was clean as was the shower room/toilet. Highly recommended.
2906,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"I thought Samantha at the front desk along with the whole crew in the restaurant for exceptional. This is a great hotel, very comfortable and central to old town, and the hop on hop off buses start right outside the hotel. You can’t go wrong with this hotel."
2907,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Good location. Inadequate lifts - often long wait. Room not ready for check-in, almost two hours late - though, conversely, being chased to leave room bang on 11am, on day of departure. Great bar and restaurant staff. During three mornings, breakfast - first two were excellent, with ""menu selection"" and waitress service - but, third morning was a self serve buffet and many items had run out / not been replenished, and, no orange juice or brown bread. Very clean and comfortable room with large, excellent bathroom and shower. Building layout makes for additional stairs to negotiate between lift / elevator, and rooms Or public areas."
2908,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"We booked a deluxe room and were extremely happy. Initially we were going to book a standard room but I'm so happy we changed. The room was modern, spacious & clean with tall ceilings, huge windows and a skylight in the bath. The tub was enormous and made for luxurious soaking and the linens and bed were extremely comfortable. There are complimentary snacks & drinks and hot cooked breakfast every morning in the restaurant which gave each day a lovely start. The staff was wonderful and friendly and the hotel is clearly managed well. The hotel is close to bus stops (right in front) and tons of shopping. Our airport tram dropped us off at St Andrews Sq and it was an easy 10 min walk with rolling carryons. Waverley Train station is just steps away. It was our first trip to Edinburgh…"
2909,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Stayed at the Apex Waterloo for 4 nights. Had previously stayed at the hotel last October '22. Staff are excellent, very attentive to our needs. Food excellent-has breakfast daily and has room service 1 night. Room large and clean. Would definitely stay again"
2910,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"This is a truly exceptional hotel! It is rare that everything is perfect, but everything was just that here. Amazing staff, rooms, cleanliness, location, restaurant, and other amenities. Irene, the manager was so helpful with a problem that we had with our reservation. She literally saved our whole vacation in Edinburgh and was so nice and professional!"
2911,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,We had a single overnight stay and the staff and checkiin process were smooth and room was clean although the view was terrible. We had concerns about our room door being a fire safety hazard and the shower door was so inneffectual we totally flooded the bathroom everytime we had a shower - a major trip hazard. Room service only had two (unsuitable) items on the menu late at night...virtually no choice at all. Can't see us every going back to an Apex.
2912,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"In the right place, friendly helpful staff. Rooms were clean, beds amazingly comfortable. The little duck was an excellent touch and keepsake. Would def return. We were in room 703, this seemed the quieter side, friends in room 711, little bit of noise, early bins etc but didn’t spoil any part of the stay"
2913,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Title says it all! Hotel is a few minutes walks from all main locations in Edinburg: princes’street, St. Andrew, castle (5 to 15mn walks counting lights traffics and hills to climb). Best feature is that Waterloo place is a cocoon on its own: 100m down the road you can see all the traffic from the city center, but you in front of the hotel there are almost no traffic. All tourist bust depart on the over side of the street and that is a mega plus. Staff was more than helpful during our stay and willing to share their knowledge of the city. We enjoyed the swimming pool at the end of the day (family trip with a non teenager going on 20) Full amenities available (sauna, running mills…) we did not try all that was available, but it was there. Cleanliness: check, hospitality: check,…"
2914,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Although not exactly offering particularly great value for money, this was a decent hotel with a very comfortable, spacious room, albeit a little bit characterless. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast menu was excellent but on our final day it was buffet only (with limited choice and lukewarm food) with no warning or explanation as to why. The hotel was in an excellent location being very central and close to the station yet on a significantly quieter road than the main new town shops and attractions. I would happily stay here again but would probably explore other options before doing so."
2915,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"This hotel was clean. The location was convenient. The beds were really comfy, and the bathroom was huge. The staff was very friendly. The lobby bar was great for taking a break and having a quick drink and bite to eat."
2916,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,We have stayed at this hotel several times and never been disappointed. The location is great for train travellers and for walking around different areas of the city. The deluxe rooms are very comfortable with good attention to detail.
2917,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"The hotel is very convenient and has nearby eateries. We are delighted with complimentary drinks, room upgrades, and use of facilities. Staff are helpful and friendly, making us feel very welcomed. Will come back again if we are visiting Edinburgh"
2918,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Clean and comfortable and well maintained. Good location. Shame the bar is soulless at night and the music is dire!!!! Better livelier music when we checked in during the day!!! Why does it have to be controlled centrally???
2919,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Apex Waterloo hotel staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is clean, well appointed, and in an awesome location - walking distance to all the sites and right next to a train station. While I can't speak for all the rooms, our room was very quiet."
2920,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Was charged nearly £100 more when I arrived at hotel as to what peice I agreed to on booking.com, so very disappointed with hidden costs.i would go back to the hotel again if it was not for this unseen disappointment"
2921,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Great location, hotel is clean, staff were friendly, just really felt it had no soul... hard to pinpoint... . Only one area to have drinks in, no warm or cosy feeling... . I am not saying I had a bad stay, but I would'nt return"
2922,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Perfect location for exploring the city. Hotel and staff great. The food was wonderful and the hotel was clean and stylish. The room felt a bit cold at times, especially the bathroom but otherwise a great stay."
2923,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,The Apex team’s hospitality and staff members we interacted with were exceptional during our honeymoon stay here. One of the best hotel experiences we’ve ever had & we’ll definitely be back in the future.
2924,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Hotels in the UK can be challenging, not this one! First of all clean, very nice rooms and reception, and decent bar. I would loose the carpet on the floor of the rooms, but hey, it’s UK they love their carpets. Very nice option for shower or bath, enough outlets and usb, big screen even for meetings in the room. Staff was friendly, one exception but it happens.. when I called the management it was all sorted."
2925,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Brilliant stay from start to finish. Dinner was delicious. All staff welcoming and pleasant. Room was spacious and had a lovely view. The shampoo and conditioner was high quality. Bed very comfortable. Nothing was too much trouble
2926,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Lovely bathroom, breakfasts & staff. Quality mattress. Disappointing pillows and thin duvet. Unable to find others in room. Also needed to request earplugs due to traffic and nightlife noise. Rare to find a nice spa hotel in city centre but spa area could benefit from updating."
2927,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Great location for getting about and seeing the sights. Disappointing on the parking, but knew before i booked and 2 days in one just round the corner was only £26 with the discount code provided by the hotel. Staff on reception were really helpful and friendly! Dining room and bedroom windows a little dusty but the rest of the areas were clean. Swimming pool is small - dont expect to get much more than a dip!"
2928,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Larger than average room but without a view. Nice addition of a pool but could have been warmer. Breakfast lovely and staff friendly. Air conditioning is great for the warmer weather. Would stay again
2929,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Absolutely an amazing experience. The staff are just amazing. My flight was delayed, and I missed my spa appointment. Claire was so accommodating. Rachel gives an amazing massage to be fooled she's one strong little lady. David at the front desk was so lovely and extended our stay due to have a bad start to our trip. Breakfast and dinner are highly recommended. Cleaning staff so lovely. A gentleman helped me with a window I couldn't quite master. Overall, I will tell my family and friends to return. Amazing friendly warm experience"
2930,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Myself and my niece stayed here for 2 nights and it’s one of the nicest hotels we’ve stayed in. The staff were friendly and helpful and the check in process was easy. It’s very quiet at night, no doors slamming or people stomping past. We had a twin room and it was surprisingly specious and the bathroom was lovely (the shower is so good). The mini fridge and complimentary water was a nice touch and they are replenished every day. The cleaning was also spot on…plus you get a welcome duck! It is well located as it’s less than a 5 minute walk from Waverley Station and the local and tour buses stop right outside. Will definitely be returning!"
2931,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,The hotel is well located and the staff is very helpful. The price is fair for Edinburg (prices are high here). The room is small but very confortable and it has all you need. They clean the room very well. I recommend it and i will come back.
2932,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"It was perfect from start to finish. Check-in was seemless, The room Deluxe double had everything you could want and more. The bed was super comfy, and the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash were of very good quality. The hotel was super quiet at night, even though it was nearly full for the duration of our stay."
2933,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Booked this hotel for the facilities and location to the Playhouse and was not disappointed. On arrival was given a free room upgrade and late check out. The room was spacious, modern and spotless. The pool was great. The food was good. Will be back."
2934,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Overall I enjoyed my stay at the Apex Waterloo; the staff were very kind and helpful, the room cosy and clean and the location of the hotel made it so easy to access the rest of the city. Unfortunately, however, I got a room facing the street. I had a hard time falling - and staying asleep all night because of all the noise comming from the street specially from busses and there are alot of busses going by the hotel. One night during my stay some road maintanance (or something like it) was going on outside my window until 3am... I was traveling with a friend who stayed on the other side of the hotel facing a courtyard. He had no complaines about noise, so it might just be the rooms facing the street."
2935,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"The hotel itself was in a perfect location and was really easy to get to. The cleanliness was excellent and in general the service and facilities were very good. Our check-in was poor with very little in the way of a warm welcome but the main disappointment was the room - dark, echoing, bare and very much not cosy and relaxing at all with an odd shape so the chair, table and TV were all squeezed in awkwardly. The walls were so high you could have built a mezzanine floor in there! We didn't find it relaxing at all. When we were really tired and wanted to just go and relax in our room or a quiet lounge somewhere to read, we couldn't as there wasn't anywhere. I realise I should have said something at the start, now, but I didn't think they'd move us somewhere nicer if nothing was…"
2936,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"We booked 2 family rooms to accommodate 2 adults and 4 children ages 13, 11, 6, 3. Pros The restaurant staff were exceptional, very attentive and the breakfast was lovely. we had a nice French fellow serving us in our first day, he was very kind and accommodating especially to the children. All of the wait staff were very kind and accommodating. Children eat breakfast free, including hot food so it was also great value for money. The hotel and swimming pool is clean, the rooms were clean including the bathrooms. The family rooms were a good size with one king bed and one sofa bed. Cons No robes in rooms, would’ve been nice to use to go down to the pool, or to be made available in the pool area. Some other guests had robes but they told me they were from the spa treatment…"
2937,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Really like staying here when I'm in Edinburgh. Service is great and the food is excellent. The staff is really friendly, room are large, clean and I love the big towels. Hotel was busy so they warned the restaurant would be busy at breakfast so offered in-room breakfast at no extra charge, really appreciated that!!"
2938,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"We visited the Apex Waterloo Place for a two night stay. The hotel was immaculately clean, the room spacious and stocked with everything we could need (fridge, tea and coffee making bits, hair dryer, iron, ironing board, toiletries, shower cap, HUGE bed, big TV and usb port sockets for charging devices). The staff were all really polite and helpful. I really didn't like the pillows in the room but we asked the house keeping lady on our floor (floor 6) for replacements... She wasn't fluent in English but immediately got her translator app going so she could help us, she was so, so nice and replaced our feather pillows for foam ones. The location could not have been better. Princess St 1 minute away, Calton Hill no more then 5 minutes, St James centre 2 minutes and the Royal mile…"
2939,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"All of the hotel staff were absolutely outstanding and nothing was too much trouble. The room was very good, although a little warm for us. The shower was excellent and hot water plentiful. You can ask for fresh milk in the room if you don't like the UHT sachets which we appreciated very much. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliabel too, which was helpful. We ate in the restaurant one evening and the food and service were excellent."
2940,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Beautiful hotel gorgeous rooms and fabulous service. We have just had a one night stay here for our anniversary and would definitely return. The staff were super attentive and helpful. Top tip if you’re driving make sure you park in the Q Park and get the hotel discount!!
2941,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Lovely stay in Edinburgh at a lovely hotel with lovely kind staff. Excellent location with easy access to buses to visit zoo and and trams/buses to airport. I walked everywhere else, castle, shops, museums, etc."
2942,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Excellent hotel in all respects. Enjoyed the pool. Good room, staff and Location. I used the bar. I would stay again. My friends were of a similar opinion. I originally booked on line and thought the app should be more responsive."
2943,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"The Apex hotel is at Waterloo place in the city of Edinburgh.This is around a 5 minute walk from Edinburgh Waverley train station.We had a warm welcome by Kieran at the reception.There is a swimming pool at this hotel but we didn’t have time to use it.The room was a lovely king size bed,a great 42 “size tv.The bathroom had a walk in shower and a deep size large bath too.Only negative review I had was a small tubes of one ,30ml of hand wash to use between two people and one 30 ml of shampoo,one conditioner too.Also one small tube hand lotion.Why isn’t there a pump dispenser in the shower.Too many little tubes of plastic.see photo.Otherwise love this hotel."
2944,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Be clear on parking arrangements before you arrive parking is in a separate car park. There are 3 car parks near the hotel. Sat nav took us to the road behind the hotel which was confusing we stumbled on the hotel.
2945,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,Had a lovely stay here with 3 friends for a special birthday. Reception staff were so friendly and very helpful. Young barman was great also. Will definitely return and would highly recommend. Fantastic location
2946,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Ideally situated near the train station and all the big attractions in Edinburgh. Staff very pleasant and helpful, hotel very clean. We have stayed here before and although it was some time ago, it was still a very pleasant stay."
2947,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Excellent hotel, great staff. Great position close to Waverley train station. Lovely rooms, good size bathroom. Private room booked for dinner, great food and extremely helpful staff. Will book again."
2948,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,"Happy with everything about this hotel: good location, friendly staff, excllent breakfasts, comfy bed and perfect bathroom with shower AND bath. Great location for shops, Everyman cinema and Waverly Stn. Recommended."
2949,Apex Waterloo Place Hotel,The Apex was a great hotel in the perfect location for our needs. The room we stayed in was a fantastic size and the only issue I had was some noise in the early morning from the street. I had expected noise with it being in the city centre and had planned to take ear plugs but forgot to pack them sadly. I’m sure if I’d called reception they may have had some but it was 3am and I don’t like to bother them earplug’s would be a great addition to the complimentary items offered in the room.
2950,Hotel Gotham,Afternoon Tea for Two Service was a little erratic but I cannot fault the food !! Superb spread . Scones and sandwiches fantastic but the Champagne Macaroons WOW johnnys margarita was to die for. The views for the Honey restaurant were amazing Great afternoon
2951,Hotel Gotham,"Stayed for first night of our honeymoon as flying from Manchester the next day. Had a wonderful time, staff were professional and helpful. Had dinner in Honey and it was delicious. The cocktails in Club Brass were outstanding, really yummy, and the bar itself has a great vibe. Loved it! Our room was pretty cool and the furnishings really nice. All in all a great stay, would stay again and definitely recommend."
2952,Hotel Gotham,"A truly stunning experience! Staff, service & food made it an exceptional stay. Having travelled to Manchester to see a concert that was cancelled mid show alongside numerous train cancellations as well on the route their, the Hotel Gotham turned out to be the only ray of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day. I stayed in the inner sanctum which is probably the nicest room I’ve ever stayed in before, it felt luxurious from its design & atmosphere setting wonderwall (live cam of Manchester). Dinning at Honey the in house 2 rosette restaurant was a wonderful experience I rarely eat 3 courses but the food was divine. I spent an evening enjoying the rooftop outdoor seating with balcony’s views at Club Brass. The cocktails were amazing especially the Merchant of Venice which as a…"
2953,Hotel Gotham,"Great hotel centrally located. Staff are very friendly too, however when we arrived the taps were spitting out AIR before water thought nothing of it, it’s an old building. Then come the morning there was no water in the taps or shower! Not exactly what I expected for a £350 1 night stay experience. Seems the whole hotel had issues as everyone mentioned it on check out that morning. The poor staff offered an apology however despite basic requirements of water no refunds were offered. I then went through Expedia who I booked with to complain and they have also confirmed that the hotel will not even offer a partial refund for this inconvenience. If I’m not mistaken any property without running water is not safe to function and should definitely not be serving food and accepting…"
2954,Hotel Gotham,Came to hotel gotham for afternoon tea . We were lucky enough to have Guido looking after us . Nothing was to much trouble he was brilliant .he deserves a pay rise honestly 5 star service will definitely be back thankyou
2955,Hotel Gotham,"My beautiful daughters wedding ..what can I say Fabulous, from start to finish service, food , intimate ambiance , staff excellent invited to the basement swing band .,what an added treat. This is a truly 5star hotel with 5 star Staff.,going that extra mile .,cannot recommend enough., we will be back ., xx"
2956,Hotel Gotham,"My Daughter treated me to a belated mothers day afternoon tea. We have had one or two over the last couple of years and this was up there in the top three. We were directed to the restaurant by the professional door man. The setting was quirky. Immaculate clean and the waitress was very well acquainted with the menu The tea was hot and replenished and the sandwiches and cakes were delightful, light and delicious with a good variety. We and other customers were not rushed and had a very enjoyable relaxed mother and daughter chit chat. Would go again certainly"
2957,Hotel Gotham,"Absolutely outstanding Bottomless Brunch. The Globe Girls greeting us outside the hotel which was so warm and wonderful. 1st time ever at the hotel and honestly i chat wait to return. The staff especially Michelle our wonderful waiting on lady was so attentive and happy... We had a good weekend boogie at tbe end of the show. Can honestly say ever person in the room laughed, chatted and it was like a family party of fun. Manchesters Best Kept secret. I can't wait to take hubby and i want to say thank you for an incredible time. 10/10 Highly Recommend and a must to visit."
2958,Hotel Gotham,"Great hotel, to start Sam the reception supervisor went above and beyond to ensure our stay was everything we expected plus more for our anniversary, chocolates in the room 😍she looked after us through out our stay 🙌 We went to club brass for cocktails on the 7th floor, Evie & Jobe made the best cocktails & Sam the chef his food is to die for, we ordered nibbles it was a like meal & delicious 😀 Throughout the night Mariano the bar manager made sure we were looked after 👍 great hotel 🙌 great staff 👌great service 5 star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2959,Hotel Gotham,"Visited hotel Gotham for our anniversary. From parking the car with an excellent concierge service from John lee to making our way to reception and being welcomed by Nico who checked us in to Sam the reception supervisor welcomed us with a welcome drink/cocktail and showed us to our room and went the extra mile providing chocolates on arrival in our room 😊. Amazing service . We headed to the roof top bar with amazing views of Manchester. Drinks from the bar staff Evie ,Jobe, Mariano & his staff looked after us with amazing drinks . Ordered food from Sam the best chef in Manchester ! Amazing stay thank-you xx"
2960,Hotel Gotham,"What can I say other than Wow Wow Wow! It’s always been my dream to stay here since I first heard about Hotel Gotham opening! The amazing former Midland Bank. Arrival We were greeted by the two lovely gents at the door who gave us lots of information and took our bags. We were given options of either to come back later when our room was available or we could go to the sixth floor and enjoy the facilities. We took the lift to the sixth floor and was created by name by the lovely receptionist, she also advised room wasn’t quite ready yet but again we could look around so we went up to Club Brass, and we took a seat and looked at the fabulous drink options. I had a Breakfast at Gatsby cocktail which was absolutely outstanding! The Room For my 40th birthday surprise my…"
2961,Hotel Gotham,"Stayed 19/04, it was a welcome return to their inner sanctum suite where I had previously stayed pre-pandemic. Prior to the stay I had a call from them to arrange extras for the stay and check in with me. I remembered this from previous stays. Their was a lift out of order which I thought I’d hate given it really is the only way up to reception on the 6th floor but their concierge staff managed this very well and kept a bunch of us entertained so much so that we didn’t mind filling up the foyer. When I arrived at reception I was greeted several times and offered a short cocktail whilst I waited. It took a little while to check in and the lift chaos made the journey to the room a little more frustrating than I knew it to be. Got in the room and very lovely, the extras that…"
2962,Hotel Gotham,"A large group of us stayed at The Gotham for my daughter’s wedding week. We were so pleased with the staff, the rooms and the service. They went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and made our stay in Manchester so very pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area!"
2963,Hotel Gotham,"Just had afternoon tea at hotel gotham.An absolute incredible experience .The decor and ambience of the honey restaurant was fantastic,the food perfect.Choice of teas immense,the hostess/waitress was so nice and friendly .Thankyou Michelle for making our visit exceptional."
2964,Hotel Gotham,"Fabulous stay. Greeted by Curtis on reception. What a superstar, he was young , vibrant , but professional too. Great banter. Room was immaculate, trendy and the bed was so comfortable. Cocktails were amazing in the top bar, all staff were so helpful with drink recommendations and so polite. Breakfast on both mornings. First morning was amazing and plentiful. Lots of choice. Second morning was busier and nothing was replenished. Had to constantly ask. That was the only fault. Everything else was faultless. Not the cheapest hotel but you get what you pay for. Location couldn’t be better."
2965,Hotel Gotham,"An unforgettable birthday stay in an iconic hotel in Manchester. Food and service was amazing. The only downside was there was only one lift currently working, so you had to share this with staff, suppliers and other customers. We can’t wait to return."
2966,Hotel Gotham,We’ve had a couple of visits and it’s always been fantastic. The moment you walk through the door staff are on hand to help. The rooms are lovely and we’ve tried a few of the room options and never been disappointed. The location is perfect for going out to local bars and restaurants. We’ve also had afternoon tea at the hotel and again it was lovely.
2967,Hotel Gotham,"So we have stayed here before and we were that impressed we had to return. It didn’t disappoint on the second visit. This place has that touch of class about it. From the front door welcome to the booking in experience through to the bar and breakfast staff. Every member of the Gotham team brings something special. It’s also in a great location as we had a meal booked at Six By Nico and concert tickets at the AO Arena, both within walking distance. If you have not been you have to check out this hotel, we will definitely be returning a third time."
2968,Hotel Gotham,"So I am a little delayed writing this as I stayed just after Valentine's Day 2023 with a friend but I wanted to still write this review as I was so impressed with the service, facilities & how fantastic the whole team are. I have stayed at Gotham before & it was fantastic the first time. This time exceeded my expectations even more as we chose to do the concierge parking service. It was £35 but WELL worth it as the car doors are opened for you before you even know it from the old style butler service that is in keeping with the hotel theme. The luggage was swooped out of the car by the very pleasant concierge team and on the bell boy trolley before I could even say hi. Very impressive. My coat hanger broke en route to the hotel and the concierge was straight on it with a…"
2969,Hotel Gotham,"My daughter took me here for an afternoon tea for Mothers Day, which was lovely. Our table was right next to the window which was perfect. The table was set lovely and the Afternoon Tea was delicious. The staff were very friendly especially our waiter Julio who was so happy and polite, and even offered to take a photo of myself and my daughter. I am visiting again next month and can't wait☺️"
2970,Hotel Gotham,"What an amazing place! Perfect location, literally a 10 minute walk from the train station. Ideal location for food, drink and shopping. On arrival we had a very warm welcome from the gent on the desk on the ground floor. He advised us our room wasn't ready but we could leave our bags and everything was on the sixth floor. We went up to do pre check in, then had a quick drink in Brass. The terraces were open and the sun was shining, what more could you want! Went shopping and returned around 3.00pm to check in. The lady and gent on reception were lovely, so friendly. They told us about available upgrades and we went for the Inner Sanctum. The gent who was on Reception (sorry I forgot your name!) showed us to the room and explained the room and how everything worked. Such a…"
2971,Hotel Gotham,Beautiful hotel . We stayed over night and also had afternoon tea . Food was amazing .the staff were really helpful and looked smart . The rooms were very classy and art deco design was exceptional . Location great
2972,Hotel Gotham,"My family and I stayed with you last night after attended a wedding. I just wanted to email to what an absolutely wonderful hotel the Gotham is. I literally felt all the staff we spoke with could not to enough to help and ensure our stay was as perfect as possible. Everyone was so friendly! Staff serving at the wedding were brilliant, it felt like they were part of the wedding party! All made for a lovely family atmosphere. We will most definitely be back and will highly recommend to others. Oh and the pillows were amazing!!"
2973,Hotel Gotham,"I have been visiting Manchester on a monthly basis since 2015 and in doing so have stayed in various hotels within the City centre never feeling settled enough to stay loyal to one in particular until 2019 when I chose to stay at The Gotham. Initially, the Hotel’s ideal location and additional fact that they offer valet parking were the key factors that attracted me. My regular trips to Manchester are purely for socialising and dining out and The Gotham is a good base. Manchester has so much to offer with regards to restaurants so I was initially reluctant to try the on-site restaurant Honey instead of going out. In fact, I did dine at Honey on my first visit and I’m so pleased that I did. It’s a fabulous restaurant matching Michelin Star standard in my experienced opinion.…"
2974,Hotel Gotham,Second time stay here and it didn't disappoint! From the moment our car was collected to the staff taking our cases back to our car it was a 5* experience. The staff are so friendly (without being annoying). Service was second to none. Cocktails on the rooftop - we were made to feel special (although it was a bit cold)! Room was fabulous as is its location. Breakfast was great. Would we stay again? You bet!
2975,Hotel Gotham,"We enjoyed a celebratory meal in the Honey Restaurant and after-dinner drinks in Bar Brass, and it was a phenomenal evening! Thank you to all the staff from the events coordinators to the doorman! Everyone was warm, welcoming, and very accommodating, nothing was too much. I would highly recommend this hotel for any events you might be thinking of holding, their attention to detail is second to none!"
2976,Hotel Gotham,"A mixed experience as we had an enjoyable stay but I’m not sure the high price point is warranted at Gotham. It’s not great value. We went for a Deluxe Room. It was of good size, the bed was large & comfy and there was a lovely selection of sweet treats laid out on arrival. All very stylish. The bathroom needed updating a little. It was ok but tired looking and a few snags have crept in. For example, the shower head was very loose and continued pouring water for a good 5 minutes after being turned off. We found the staff to be pleasant and attentive throughout the stay. No faults there. And the breakfast was fine. Nice setting and good food. Our main issues came in two forms. We booked Gotham as we had heard good things about their bar - Club Brass. 48 hours prior to…"
2977,Hotel Gotham,"We stayed at the hotel last weekend as a treat to ourselves. Having stayed in 5 star hotels before, this doesn’t warrant a 5 star rating. Positives- Location is very central within walking distance of all the main shops. Breakfast was lovely with lots of variety and the staff were very attentive. Negatives-the room was very basic, hardly any toiletries, water or milk and no bath. The toilet had already been “used” when we arrived. The dressing gowns provided were like cardboard. I had also left a dress in the room which I’d worn out that evening. When my husband contacted the hotel they said nothing had been handed in, and I followed up with an email 2 days ago with no response. Really poor service."
2978,Hotel Gotham,"Nice hotel but its definitely not 5 star.It absolutely doesn’t command the prices it’s charging and I recommend you stay elsewhere if you want a bit of luxury. Positives: -Breakfast and afternoon tea were delicious. Staff really attentive. -Club Brass great ambience, pleasant staff and fab cocktail selection Negatives -Reception is on the 6th floor and the stairs are pretty arduous so you get sick of taking the lift -Some of the reception staff are poorly trained and a bit rude -No spa or leisure services and no baths in the standard rooms -Cleanliness of the hotel isn’t up to scratch. Communal areas are dirty.My bed had blood stains across the linen on check in. Appears room service must have cut themselves whilst making the bed -You will be charged a £200 hold to check in.…"
2979,Hotel Gotham,"Booked a 1 night stay here at the end of March. It was to celebrate a belated birthday and I wanted to add some extra touches. I emailed the hotel guest relations team with regards to adding a bottle of wine & chocolates onto the room. Saskia took care of everything and made the whole process so easy and stress free, she also sent me information on massages that I wanted to book on the day we checked out and kindly gave us complimentary late check out until 12pm which was greatly appreciated. The girls who came to do the massages were superb - so professional and very relaxing! I also opted to book car parking through the hotel and Shaun sorted this out for me no problem. The hotel itself is absolutely stunning, such a quirky little gem with so much characters right in the heart…"
2980,Hotel Gotham,"First impressions, this hotel looks lovely and I was really looking forward to staying here. However, after staying here for 1 night I can’t understand how it has managed to get a 5 star rating, it’s more like a 4 star. The positives - beautiful building in a convenient location - lovely, quirky decor - fabulous cocktails - comfortable room with lovely bathroom The not so positive - communication issues whilst staying at the hotel. We got told conflicting information from members of staff. One member said we could have a drink in Gilt but when we went we got told it was ticket only which meant we had to then go back up to Club Brass. - untidy parts of the hotel - some members of staff not as friendly as others - the wait for drinks in Club Brass was quite long and it…"
2981,Hotel Gotham,"Hotel Gotham was very underwhelming. I was looking forward to the 5* stay, but I’d say it was more 3-4* at best. The entrance lobby is tiny, and arriving at check in time is very claustrophobic, then waiting for the lift with everyone else, to go up to the 6th Floor to actually check in is a bit of a faff! The check in area again is very small and the staff are squeezing past each other and the guests are crammed into a small area. The lady who checked us in was very pleasant and welcoming. We then proceeded to go back downstairs to our room. The room was clean and tidy, but again underwhelming. We stayed in a standard double, it was OK nothing to shout about. We then went to the exclusive club brass, which has 3 terraces, one of which we couldn’t use, as there was…"
2982,Hotel Gotham,"The staff and service was amazing - everyone we met went above and beyond. Hotel is in a great location and very quirky. Downside is we spent too much time in lifts - enter ground floor, reception 6th floor, room first floor. We were allocated our room which was an accessible executive double - unfortunately the sink was so low it was unusable so we asked to move. We were given a complimentary upgrade which was a lovely gesture but as the room was significantly smaller I’m not sure what the upgrade provided. There was no complimentary water in the room which is unusual. Breakfast was luke warm, the toast had barely seen a grill and is served in bags - no side plate so not the easiest to eat. Lastly the bar added a 12.5% service charge - when you are being charged £60 for…"
2983,Hotel Gotham,"The good: The confirmation phone call a couple of days before our trip was a nice surprise but the ensuing email informing me of additional service charges that would be added was less welcome (although not a surprise thanks to previous reviews). The inner sanctum suite is simply stunning, the bed is super comfy and the shower is powerful. The cake platter I requested for my husband's birthday was delicious, and the temperature of the room was just right for us. Overall we enjoyed our stay as it was a special occasion, but I doubt we would return. The not-so-good: The room service was late and the food was cold and unappetising, our request for bottled water was ignored, and the staff on the ground floor could have been more helpful and welcoming. They didn't even ask if we…"
2984,Hotel Gotham,"We were disappointed to find out that the vault bar upstairs was closed during our stay and we were not forewarned of this, after dinner we were directed to the bar downstairs which felt like a 1980’s swimming baths changing room! The restaurant food was excellent, we had the taster menu and the staff working there were excellent, it wasn’t the same on returning for breakfast though, it was a very slow service and we were crammed in the corner on a table near the heater which needed a good clean. If you are looking for a luxury stay, try the stock exchange hotel nearby - now that was incredible."
2985,Hotel Gotham,"Booked for my husband as a Christmas present. We went with my sister and her partner. Hotel was amazing and all the little touches were just special, even closing the curtains and putting soft music on when we returned to our room. Staff were attentive, polite and so helpful. Loved it and shall be returning in the future so definitely recommend a visit and stay ."
2986,Hotel Gotham,"Stayed here at the weekend. Everything was perfect. The staff are fantastic. Welcoming the moment you step inside. The food was 1st class, bar was epic and the room was out of this world. Look fwd to returning in the near future. Highly recommended. Thank you hotel gotham."
2987,Hotel Gotham,"Had afternoon tea, the staff were so friendly and helpful. Our waitress Suzanna took great care of us. We have dietary requirements and they were really accommodating. The gluten free scones were the best we have ever had. As we were leaving the staff at the front door booked a taxi for us and waited outside for it for us. Would definitely come back."
2988,Hotel Gotham,"What a welcome! From the minute I dumped my bags at the door to breakfast the next morning, I feel welcome. Thank you for a wonderful stay. The cocktails and service in Club Brass is also fantastic. Love this place!!"
2989,Hotel Gotham,"This looks the part, but isn't the photos taken when it was brand new looking tiered now. I booked online with an upgrade to a directors room IT was small. I also brought a voucher which they told me I'd get back, but still took my money full price"
2990,Hotel Gotham,Everything was about perfect! The only things I could recommend: eliminate some of the objects gathering dust in the room and improve the bed quality because the bed was literally not stable. Very friendly and lovely staff 🫶🏼
2991,Hotel Gotham,The staff were amazing. Friendly and helpful. They went the extra mile and made the experience that much better. The incredible views of Manchester from the top bar and the unique hotel decor (as the hotel name suggests) makes it a special experience. You can't find a better location in central Manchester and access to the bright lights of Manchester. Thank you to the staff and I would highly recommend Gotham Hotel.
2992,Hotel Gotham,"An absolutely stunning experience cannot fault it. The bed was super comfy and i slept right through the night (not something i have done in years!). It was a relaxing but different overall full experience, not just a night stay - The staff were all so amazing, friendly and nothing was too much trouble . Only downside - I had to leave and go home :("
2993,Hotel Gotham,"Really enjoyed this hotel. The club rooms are really nice . It can however feel a literal stuffy due to the heating system and a lack of ability to have any fresh air . The windows cannot be opened although on looking at them I would say that is understandable they were very old windows and we were on a high floor . We ate at restaurant Honey and enjoyed our visit there , the service was great ( attentive but none intrusive ) and the price reasonable. We also enjoyed the Brass club and the downstairs bar GILT , that was a highlight of the evening with a live band playing. I would return to Gotham and really enjoyed our stay . The following morning I was able to order breakfast in the room with no issue and received everything I would have received had we have eaten in the…"
2994,Hotel Gotham,Myself and my husband stayed here for a child free night away. The hotel is a show stopper from the moment you step through the door. Such a quirky feel with fab decor 1920’s theme. The staff were very attentive from the moment we checked in with a complimentary cocktail. The brass bar served amazing cocktails with a twist on regular menus. Great view of Manchester from the roof top bar. Again the service in here was good the staff very attentive. The hotel itself and rooms all immaculately clean. The room has real character and the bed was extremely comfortable. I would really recommended this place as a treat. Much better than any chain hotel we have stayed in previously!
2995,Hotel Gotham,Perfect afternoon. Gluten free afternoon tea all to myself with warm scones. Such a treat for a coeliac. Fabulous building with a great atmosphere. Would definately go back again & maybe stay overnight.
2996,Hotel Gotham,"I booked the inner sanctum suite for my partner's birthday 1 night midweek. The decor is impressive and the room was spacious and fun. They even put a happy birthday message on a plate with 2 macaroons, which was a nice touch. I had 2 cocktails at the bar, and they were both delicious and interesting (although I found out sour is not to my taste). In my opinion, the drinks were fairly priced with cocktails between £13-14 (plenty city bars have similar prices but much poorer quality and service). The bar area is nice and quiet until a company group came in around 10pm, when we left. Overall quality of breakfast was good, however not without issues. Concierge service is good for valet parking. However, this was let down by 2 mistakes at breakfast. First, my partner ordered…"
2997,Hotel Gotham,"I had received an afternoon tea for 2 gift voucher and wanted to use this at Hotel Gotham. I telephoned the hotel on 3rd Feb, 2023 and pressed the appropriate key in order to speak to a member of staff from the 'dining' department. This just rang and rang so I hung up, telephoned again and got put through to reception. I was informed by the member of staff that they too had struggled to get a response from the dining staff that morning and suggested I send an email instead. I did and this detailed the fact I had a gift voucher for the afternoon tea for 2 which could be used at Hotel Gotham therefore requested their availability for the 15th Feb and gave my phone number if this would be easier should they need to discuss any further details. Got a response 3hrs later saying they…"
2998,Hotel Gotham,"Me and my partner we booked an exciting evening at Gotham Hotel following recommendations. The Hotel itself was beautiful and the room was just as we imagined, complete with immaculate deo, creating a fabulous atmosphere. We could not fault this at all. However our overall experience was unfortunately tarnished by the experience we had using room service. Firstly we had to return the frozen wetherspoons like Pizza and Burger we ordered after finding that both were either soft and soggy or tough as nails and burned - Both inedible and well beneath the standard we had expected. Let alone the price of this pizza being £15 we were gutted . The staff member who attended our room told us we could always ""order from Deliveroo.""When asking staff if there was anything she would…"
2999,Hotel Gotham,The service and location were second to none and I absolutely loved the shower. The hotel room was clean and had some cool details. The double bed was very small which unfortunately let the rest of the hotel down.
3000,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Good stay overall Booked the King Bed with Bath Positives - Nice room with a big bed - Breakfast was very good quality - Late checkout until 2pm as Gold member - Nearly all staff delightful - Very nice bed - Nice bathroom amenities but in big pump bottles Negatives / Could be Better - Brusquely told off at breakfast by oldest member of breakfast room staff who shooed us away from our chosen table even after we'd been shown to it by another member of staff as we waited for it to be cleaned. Breakfast still good though. - Window in room was very small - didn't impact hugely though - Tv was temperamental - Bath robes are very very small - ideal if you're 5'6 and slim as a rake. Waitrose is very nearby, as well as a tesco express, if you need any bits and bobs. Positives…"
3001,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","I was on a Scotland/England tour. Tested positive for Covid 5 days into it and required to isolate in York at the Indigo as the tour moved on. The staff were awesome! The hotel is very nice, strategically located in York area for everything, and the room very accommodating.. good thing as I spent 5 days in it! I’m sure the situation was as unexpected for them as it was for me! They were down a room for 5 days and I saw a constant flow of guests coming in. Staff were so kind, friendly and thoughtful.. making sure I had clean towels, water, etc. Whenever I called for assistance .. always accommodating. No matter how nice a hotel is, the staff make its reputation/ impression on guests! I’m impressed! And, am grateful for their kindness and consideration! Breakfast is…"
3002,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Hotel Indigo enjoys a good position not far from the city centre. We booked our car into the carpark for 2 days which did cost £30 however we were aware of this before we travelled. The check in was efficient, the room small but adequate. Comfy bed, slightly lumpy pillows, nice shower room and most of all clean. We walked to and from the city centre without any issues. We had one drink in the hotel bar, however really disagree with a 10% service charge for a drink! Breakfast was nice, continental option and we opted for poached eggs which were very nicely presented and staff were helpful."
3003,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Had a nice stay- Amy, Naty, and Sammi so helpful with some special issues we had to deal with. Enjoyed the breakfast, and the efficient and friendly servers. They should put the felt protectors on all the desk chairs in the rooms- They’re very noisy when guests are moving the chairs- I could hear them being moved around at night. All in all a very nice stay in York. (Contrary to another review- we liked the kebabs across the street!)"
3004,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Nice hotel, staff friendly and helpful. Close to everything. Tapas across the road os superb. In walking distance to all sights. Only issue was robes were small and breakfast isn't worth £20 albeit it was nice. Ate over the road the next day. Would return."
3005,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","This hotel when view gives you the impression it’s by the water but in fact it’s in the centre of York, it’s also says you have private parking but that’s only if your there early as it’s limited spaces, we arrived at 7.30pm and had to drop the cases to our room and then drive around to find parking which took about 1 hour so was very tied at this point so just wanted to eat and relax but when we got back to the hotel it was to be told they only do pizza to say we where disappointed was mild as not everyone like pizza, we then had to go and find somewhere to eat and at this point it was 9pm. When we got back to the hotel I wanted a shower then bed but when in the shower it flooded the bathroom and went into the bedroom, at this point we both wanted to go home. We reported it to…"
3006,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Stayed here when we were watching James at the Barbican, it’s the perfect location for this as it’s literally a 5 minute walk away from the venue. It’s also a short 10 minute walk into the centre of York for all the shops, bars and restaurants. The only issue I would say is the car parking availability, there is a limited number that are a short walk from the hotel, so I would advise to get to the hotel as early as possible, but I do believe there are other car parks nearby. The hotel it self was excellent, the staff are very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The decor in the reception, bar/restaurant, landings and our room is as all tastefully done and to a high standard. The bed was very comfortable, however my partner and the lady in the other couple we were with said the…"
3007,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",Really nice hotel. Located just outside the hustle and bustle of the city centre but close enough to walk to the shops/restaurants etc 10-15 minute walk to the cathedral and city walls too. All staff were lovely and helpful during our stay even helping us book a taxi for a car driving experience nearby to save driving. We timed it wrong with the bank holiday and was extremely lucky to get a space in the nearby carpark as their car park and peel street carpark seemed full both days! Only down side was how hard the bed was! I have trouble with my back so it really didnt help and was uncomfortable but it was a small negative in comparsion to everything else. Had a lovely weekend and it wouldn't stop us visiting again.
3008,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","What a lovely place. Literally just in the centre of York, 10 minutes walking distance to The Shambles. Fantastic staff - each one friendly with excellent service. Really good choice for breakfast. Room clean and spacious. Nice little touches with cake and biscuits. Parking not included but just around the corner. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby, would highly recommend."
3009,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Fantastic hotel, fantastic staff. This hotel is one off the true gems in york the service is amazing and the rooms are great value for money everything you need for a good night sleep. I stay all over the uk and abroad, and I can truly say this hotel as the wow factor."
3010,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",Arrived to celebrate anniversary. On check in told no water 10 til 4 each day . Breakfast was also moved to earlier time. Tried to complain but all we got was sorry and thanks for your feedback . Happy to take full price but not give 100% service Disappointing .
3011,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","This one my second time there and I must say that the level of attention by some of your staff, specially the Spanish girl (Naty) still the same as before,excellent!!. I'll definitely keep coning back when I need a stop in beautiful York!!"
3012,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Lovely boutique style hotel in a great location within the city walls in easy reach of the city centre. Parking offsite but only a few minutes walk, little disappointed the only hotel food was a pizza restaurant but they looked lovely. Rooms are well equipped and modern."
3013,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Stayed for 2 nights in April. Nothing about this hotel was impressive. Rooms would benefit from a deep clean and redecoration. Staff tried their best and were so nice. York is a beautiful city, full of character but none of this was reflected in the hotel. We expected more from the Indigo brand having used it previously."
3014,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Very well run hotel in a central position within walking distance of all attractions. The rooms are modern and well equipped with everything you need. Equipped with hairdryer, soap, shampoo, body lotion, large tv, fridge, safe. Room service available for breakfast and pizzas. Plenty of choice for breakfast whether you have full English or continental. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Would stay again and would look to stay in another of the Indigo hotels."
3015,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","This is an agreable, efficient and pleasnt place to stay. Staff were helpful (I use a 3- wheel walking frame); the breakfasts were good. It is very well placed for reaching many of York's attractions on foot. But this is a not a hotel for everyone. The beds are extraordinarily high, and with my trousers 72 cm inside leg, I had ot stand on a (well-filled) pillow to get in. There were 4 large drawers but the wardrobe was very small: fine for single person for a few says, but difficult for a couple who might be attending several formal engagements, or trevelling for a week. . Breakfasts were good and plentiful with great variety. Room service was mainly pizza..."
3016,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Such a lovely hotel. Nice attention to detail. Stylish and boutique even smells great! Rooms clean hairdryer, slippers robe, hairdryer coffee tea facility in the room. Comfy bed. Staff were very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was perfect and Mandy who ran the restaurant was extremely hard working. Great central location. Strongly recommend"
3017,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Definitely recommend this hotel. Hotel is really well placed in the City Centre. It is close enough to be near things, but far enough out to not be too noisy. Staff were really friendly and helpful. The rooms were nicely decorated and fitted out. They have the usual facilities such as kettle, 40"" TV, fridge, safe, chair and desk and nice extra's like ironing board, slippers, robe, complimentary water and biscuits. Bathroom was good size and had a double size shower, which has Shampoo, conditioner and body gel. Beds was just right as were the pillows. There were some nice touches around the room and hotel (Easter theme), which showed a level of care and attention. The breakfast was really nice. Good selection of both cold and hot food. Cold food was buffet style and hot was menu…"
3018,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Several of my items went missing from my room whilst staying at Indigo hotel York and upon complaining about this to management, I am disgusted at their response. They are doing nothing about it. Indigo York is an expensive hotel to stay in considering it is not even in the centre of the city and I am a loyal guest, having stayed at multiple IHG hotels before. However, I have cancelled my upcoming Indigo hotel Bath stay as I can't risk more of my items going missing again - it is costing me too much to replace them. I don't expect this to happen at an IHG hotel as my previous stays have been marvellous but I will never stay with IHG again after this. Do not stay here if you want to leave with all your belongings."
3019,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Fine location and facilities, but the manager is not nice and professional. She seems entitled. As an platinum member, I don't think it is a very cost-effective choice. Also, the breakfast is confusing, sometimes the staff says you can choose two items sometimes say you only can choose one."
3020,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","A lovely modern hotel just a few hundred yards away from town centre. Rooms are spacious and our double room had a king size bed which was very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and walk in shower was excellent. We opted for breakfast included and was not disappointed, we ordered from the menu and could have pretty much anything. All the staff were friendly and helpful and even recommended where to visit in York as well as restaurants."
3021,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",Staff on reception on arrival were friendly and helpful and the hotel is in a good location. However the bathroom smelt strongly of damp and the shower didn’t drain. We chose this hotel although it was more expensive than other chain hotels because it was my birthday but it wasn’t worth it.
3022,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","The hotel is a 20 min walk from the station in a delightful street. We had a very positive experience from the moment we arrived at the hotel even though we were an hour early, our room was ready, which was great! Check in was swift and the front desk staff were so pleasant and helpful. We had a slight issue with the room we were given but that was quickly resolved by the front desk and we ended up in room 308 which was perfect! Room was clean, spacious and the complementary Parkin and bottles of water most welcome. Breakfast choices were excellent with a good buffet selection and excellent cooked options. Again staff were incredibly welcoming and friendly and we felt very at ease. We would have no hesitation in recommending and would happily return when we next visit…"
3023,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Had a very pleasant 3 night stay in the Hotel Indigo. Location is ideal for visiting York attractions with the centre and many restaurants within walking distance. Our room was stylishly decorated, quiet and quite spacious. All the staff were helpful and courteous. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice for both hot and cold dishes. It was easy to drop off bags just outside the hotel and then carry on to park the car. We used the Just Park app and parked beside the church in Lawrence Street, which cost us just over £20 for the three days and is about 6 mins walk from the hotel. Would happily stay here again."
3024,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Lovely stay, just as good as last time we stayed 4 years ago. The staff are great, the rooms comfortable and the breakfasts are excellent. The hotel is in a very convenient location for sight seeing, parking is limited though. Will definitely be back."
3025,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","I had a great stay whilst visiting York for a Conference, check in was a very smooth process and very quick with great service from reception. It’s only a 15 minute walk from York Station which was also very good and at half the price of the conference venue a bargain. Room was on the first floor, clean; comfy bed and very modern with a spotless en suite shower. Had Breakfast and again excellent food (freshly cooked to order with a buffet), again a big plus and very friendly and helpful staff. Check out was as efficient and friendly as check in so no complaints. Overall a great stay and can’t wait to return."
3026,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Staying two nights for work in a gorgeous and comfortable room. Just a superlative stay. The best two nights sleep I have had for ages, coupled with staff who sincerely care for you and want you to be contented. Cannot recommend highly enough"
3027,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",A fairly central hotel within easy walk of the city centre. Rooms were nice with a huge comfy bed. I was disappointed with the view. I paid extra for a city view which was basically the delight of looking at a wall! There is no view from these rooms so don’t be conned and pay extra. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Good breakfast with plenty of choice.
3028,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","I have stayed in another Indigo hotel but this one, by comparison, was nowhere near as good. The room could have been cleaner. It was dusty and the carpet hadn’t been properly vacuumed. They suggested a car park which was full and did t indicate how busy it would be to park. It took an hour to find somewhere. It was a a bit jaded around the edges and is clearly very popular and used a lot by tourists. I felt it was very expensive for the room and especially its size, it was very small. Bed was comfy. Wouldn’t stay again."
3029,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","First impressions, lovely hotel and friendly staff. Sadly pillows very lumpy, stayed in room 105, two nights stay, awoken both nights from approx 0600hrs onwards by staff using the canteen opposite, doors banging, staff having conversations outside the door. Absolutely dreadful. Breakfast is very good and lovely staff serving."
3030,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","I can't find anything negative to say about our two night stay. The hotel staff were great the breakfast was also great. The location was perfect for us to, just a note the car park is a wee walk away so I would recommend stopping out side to decant your luggage first and looking at Google maps to see where it is before getting there."
3031,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","The hotel was OK, the location was good, the breakfast was nice, the staff were OK. Having stayed at Indigo Stratford upon Avon numerous times I have to say that they are streets ahead with all aspects of customer experience, they are much more professional in the way they talk to you, the way they dress, their whole demeanour really. Having said all this if you have not been to Stratford Upon Avon Indigo then York Indigo is acceptable."
3032,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","We stayed here for 2 nights in a chilly but sunny March. Hotel was lovely. We had booked a standard room and were more than happy with it. Although not huge, it had everything we needed. Bathroom was really nice too. Breakfast was lovely with plenty on choice on the cold buffet and the hot menu. Staff were all lovely. Plenty of restaurants within a few mins walk and you’re pretty much in York city centre. Would highly recommend and would go back to this hotel next time we visit York."
3033,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","My partner Adrian and I stayed there for a few days and we were met at reception by Naty who was an absolute delight from the start. We had trouble with our heating in the room but Chris helped us out straight away and between him and Naty we had an amazing time. Smiling, happy and helpful staff throughout our stay. Definitely stay there again and would recommend anyone to choose to stay here. Thank you to all for making our stay such a pleasure"
3034,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Great hotel to be fair with staff that are great and friendly to deal with, clean and very presentable hotel, this may sound odd in a review but the hotel was almost too quiet, not that I am complaining about that"
3035,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",My fiancé and I stayed for 2 nights at this great hotel. The rooms are very well appointed with lovely extras like biscuits and fizz! We were quite lucky to get a fantastic deal through itison. Breakfast each morning was plentiful with an excellent cold selection maybe the scrambled egg’s could be improved i found them a bit dry. All the staff were lovely and helpful would definitely recommend!
3036,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",We were greeted by very friendly staff. Our room was very pleasant and we appreciated the extra touches .. a box of parkin biscuits which were delicious .. and a bottle of fizz in the fridge. We also liked the personal welcome notes. Very cosy. Breakfast was superb. Lots of fresh fruit on the buffet .. and fresh bakery products. ... perfect for me .. a vegetarian .. and my husband also managed the cooked breakfast ! Outstanding breakfast.
3037,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",After looking at a few hotels in York myself and wife decided on trying this hotel. There was conflicting reviews on parking and wheelchair accessibility in rooms so decided to contact the company to discuss more in detail. My wife has mobility issues and is a wheelchair user but we wanted a room with a bath in the bathroom opting away from a disabled room as we have had so many bad experiences in the past at other hotels. We contacted the hotel directly 4 weeks prior to staying. Spoke to a lady on reception about the above and she recommended a king-size premium room with a bath and a shower as there would be more space for use of the wheelchair. So we agreed and booked. Parking is on a 1st come basis for £14 a night with limited spaces and no disabled bays. So I looked…
3038,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Stayed one night, bed and breakfast on a Monday, King Premium room with bath and shower. Hotel smells lovely when you go inside. Staff are all really nice and welcoming and helpful. Room was really spacious, big bathroom with nice large bath for two and double showers and sinks. Everything was great, except we had a room that was adjoinging another by a door and we could hear the neighbouring room chatting away and walking around until 1.30am which interuppted our sleep. Breakfast was nice. Location also great, lots of coffee shops and places to eat on same road as hotel. Only five minute walk to Shambles and centre. I'd definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again, but would ask for quiet room without an adjoining door."
3039,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Most comfortable hotel bed I’ve ever slept in. Shower was amazing. Place was spotless. Breakfast was delicious. Short walk into town, lots of restaurants nearby. Staff very attentive and helpful. We would highly recommended. No parking on site but we used a JustPark less than 5 minutes away"
3040,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Stayed here for my dad's 50th birthday, voucher bought through virgin experiences. Hotel exceeded my expectations. Rooms are very clean and stylish, the complimentary chocolates, slippers and ginger parkin were a welcome surprise. Breakfast had a great choice of continental and hot breakfast cooked to order. Had some drinks at the bar which were great. Naty was particularly helpful with checking in to the hotel and arranging parking for us (£14 per day). Would recommend to anyone staying in York, and great city centre location!"
3041,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",We stayed here for 3 nights.and really loved our start. Great location easy walking distance to the centre. Quite location with ample restaurants close by. The breakfast was great with plenty of choice. The staff were lovely and the rooms were very clean. Would definitely say again.
3042,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","We stayed here valentines night lovely hotel spotlessly clean nice touch were chocs in room and delicious biscuits, breakfast was lovely very tasty full English good selection of cereals and pastries would recommend this hotel location great"
3043,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","I stayed at this hotel, on the weekend of 3rd of February for 2 nights and from walking in to reception on first day to leaving on the last day everything was great. Reception staff very helpful, rooms lovely, bar staff great, breakfast was lovely and tasty and hot, and Helen the supervisor was fabulous and very helpful. Would definitely go again."
3044,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","We spent one night at this hotel. It’s spotlessly clean. Our room on the third floor was very comfortable. It had a really nice bathroom with a powerful shower. No robes though. The free toiletries were good quality. The bed was huge, and so comfy, and the bed linen was very good quality. We were able to access our room early, which after a long drive from Kent, was a real bonus. There was plenty of choice for breakfast, the continental selection was constantly refilled with delicious pastries. The cooked breakfast was well presented with high quality produce. The staff were all so friendly and welcoming, and the location, so close to the centre, is just about perfect. The hotel has a small number of free parking spaces, but there’s also a pay car park close by."
3045,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Very friendly relaxed hotel, with great staff who are very attentive. The room was amazing, and included a free packet of biscuits which was very much appreciated after our long journey. Room very comfortable, but the bathroom was first class with a rainfall shower AND a bath. Breakfast was a buffet style with plenty of a range of cereals and pastries. Highly recommend this hotel which is about a 10 minute walk from the Shambles and city centre."
3046,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","I arranged a trip for a hen do and right from booking with Kamila, the team were amazing. Beautiful rooms, lovely breakfast and Helen the manager just made everything extra special. Check in was smooth for such a big booking, the bar staff really looked after us too. Thank you!"
3047,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",Helen the supervisor was fantastic. We were on a hen weekend and she joined in with our fun and helped to make it a great weekend. The hotel was great. Great choice of breakfast. Free water and sweets
3048,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel",Nice boutique style hotel. Service was a bit slow at breakfast but food really good. Interesting rooms and really clean. Really centrally located. Sound proofing not great and heard a lot of noise from hallways. Good overall and would recommend!
3049,"Hotel Indigo York, an IHG Hotel","Lovely welcoming receptionist on arrival (Naty) Beautifully smelling lobby and stairwell with modern, comfortable and spacious en-suite room. Good size bathroom, although shower water pressure could be better. Complimentary water and snacks throughout or stay, reception staff very helpful with information on York. The buffet breakfast had a good selection although the full cooked breakfast was disappointing. The staff in the restaurant during breakfast were not as friendly and helpful as the reception team. Overall lovely stay and would return to the Hotel Indigo York."
3050,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Good size room, clean and decent standard. Good range of choice for continental breakfast foods, bit more flexibility in choice of hot breakfast would be better as was choice of a single set menu option. Can't comment on restaurant as they didn't have the item in tried to order through room service so I ate out. TV signal/channel choice was a bit hit and.miss"
3051,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Stayed here with my husband on the 5th June for our first wedding anniversary, amazing hotel and staff. Room was fab, view was brilliant! Breakfast was amazing, husband was happy, will definatly stay again xx"
3052,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","This hotel is modern, very welcoming and comfortable. We booked a suite which has everything you will need for a weekend break in Manchester, the bed is so comfortable and the bathroom immaculate. We highly recommend a cocktail made by the knowledgeable and passionate Cameron, she makes a great Espresso Martini, wow! We will definitely stay again."
3053,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Fantastic hotel. Staff extremely friendly, especially at breakfast (which was possibly the best I’ve ever had in a hotel) THE most comfiest bed ever and a very convenient location, right opposite the Football Museum and practically in the railway station. Would highly recommend."
3054,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","I booked this hotel for a night away with my daughter to go shopping. I originally booked the half board option and requested the menu. Once I received the menu, I did change the booking to just breakfast as the menu we wouldn't of eaten. Check in was quick and easy, staff were helpful. The room smelt lovely, and was well presented. The location is great, right next to Victoria train station. The only niggle, but we had a low floor and we was right next to the tram lines. They were very noisy most of the night. I was going to book a higher room but they didn't have 2 bed to request. I wish I had of paid the extra now as we can only got one bed anyway. Breakfast was help yourself to cereals, toast etc and order your cooked part. The breakfast was lovely. Thanks for a nice stay"
3055,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",Nadia on reception but excellent as was Ros with answering emails. We had a high king bed Room was clean and bathroom nice and modern with a brilliant rain shower Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice and very helpful staff I would definitely stay here again if I’m back in Manchester
3056,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",We had afternoon tea here and it was lovely! A really nice selection of sandwiches and cakes (plenty of cakes!) and a glass of Prosecco was included. The staff were so helpful and friendly. I would definitely recommend the afternoon tea here if you want to treat yourself.
3057,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Really central location, close to all the places I needed to go and very peaceful. I loved my stay and the customer service was great! Gabby was really attentive and always smiling! Would definitely recommend it"
3058,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","We stayed here during Eurovision & I’m glad we did. The hotel is centrally located which makes it easy to get anywhere in the city. The only downside was no on-site parking, however we were able to park just a short walk away at Apcoa Printworks. The staff were all friendly & provided service with a smile; especially the staff in the restaurant who were happy to stop & chat! We stayed on the top floor in one of the suites & the bed was so comfortable we didn’t want to leave. It is very high so you might need a run up to get onto it, but it’s worth it! With a separate lounge room with a comfortable couch we were extremely happy with our stay. Would definitely stay here again!"
3059,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",Left normal wire earphones in room. Called to advise I had forgotten and they were Taken to lost property where they acknowledge but hotel want £15 to post. Royal Mail website is £2.60. Staff not helpful in resolving after 2 weeks of trying to resolve
3060,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Good hotel in the city centre next to Victoria Station and tram stop. We booked a room in the old part of the building (a former tea company built 200 years ago). The room was very good and despite the hotel being next to traffic routes and a tram line there was very little outside noise intruding into the room even on the first floor. The hotel was busy but very efficiently run. I have to say how attentive we found all the members of staff with a special mention to Jay, who seemed to be everywhere yet always made time to speak with us and ask about our stay. We would stay here again."
3061,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Fabulous hotel. Very friendly staff, be at Reception, the bar staff or at the café. Comfy beds, lovely rooms nicely decorated. Perfect location. Only stayed for a couple of nights and we wish it had been longer. We’ll be coming back for sure."
3062,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Absolutely fabulous stay at Hotel IndigoManchester. From start to finish, the service and experience in the hotel was 10/10. I enquired about early check-in as my boyfriend and I had plans for his birthday, we arrived at the hotel and the lovely lady at reception checked us in straight away and had a birthday card left in the room for him! The rooms are modern, clean and very comfortable. 2 minute walk from Victoria station, Printworks and the Arndale, ideal location. Will definitely be returning, thank you for a lovely stay!"
3063,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Where do I start, I will definitely be returning to this great hotel. Quick and easy check in, frienfly and fun staff at the reception. The room was very clean and the beds were comfy (only needed a bit more milk for the room). The restaurant in the hotel is amazing, great food options and fast service. Breakfast was brilliant in the morning, the food was hot and the staff again were lovely and friendly. We were both particularly impressed by Kaitlin’s service, she was funny, yet conscientious and professional. The location was amazing and centred perfectly. On our last day we took a train into liverpoool for the day, only 35 minutes from the hotel. Absolutely perfect. Overall very impressed with the hotel and I will be returning when the weather is nice again."
3064,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",We had a fantastic room with big windows with a great view of the Manchester Cathedral! The staff were fantastic and gave us both a good laugh and shared a lot of tips and thoughts about the city! If we ever go back to Manchester this will be our hotel again!
3065,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","We visited Manchester for a 3 night stay and chose the Hotel Indigo as we have stayed here before. The location of this hotel is excellent as it is situated next to victoria station , the AO Arena and only 5 minutes walk to manchesters shops. What makes this hotel truly stand out apart from location, comfortable rooms and quality breakfast are the people who work there. We were greeted by two young men on reception in a friendly and professional manner. They introduced us to the hotels facilities and advised us that our foom was available early and could go straight up. An excellent first impression. Ì must make a special mention to the team on duty at breakfast .Two members of staff in particular are exceptional not only at their jobs but as people . They are Adriana ( i…"
3066,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",We arrived on 22nd April at around 3:30pm and there was quite a long que to check inn ( Approx 25mins) this was only a minor inconvenience for us and the rest of the stay was lovely. Once we got to check out they upgraded our room as we were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary we really appreciated this. The room was clean and had lovely decor. We had a high floor and a lovely view of the city. Both my husband and I slept well and had no noise interference. The room also has aircon/heating and as there weren’t any windows we could open in our room this was helpful. There is plenty to do in the area and was a very short walk to the AO Arena. There is no parking at this hotel but we used the Q-Park which was a 5-10 walk and cost us £22 for 24 hours. There is a beautiful bar…
3067,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",The room was super and the hotel in a great location. The restaurant staff were superb for Breakfast and the Buffett was very good. Some of the reception team were a bit forgetful as they forgot to follow through on requests for room service etc.
3068,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Stayed last weekend for a concert. Positives were a very good location for shopping and the AO arena. The hotel decor was nice and modern and rooms were spacious, comfy bed and lovely big shower. Negatives were down to really bad service. Upon check in we waited In the bar for an hour as the queue was out of the door, was very slow, luckily we had nowhere to rush to. On the evening we ordered room service, we waited 1 hour for this with nothing delivered, we called back and said the order wasn’t taken and they only do pizzas? We argued why we had been told yea to spaghetti and said we had waited too long. We then just ordered pizzas, waited another 45 minutes to be told that order wasn’t made either. By this point my partner was rightly so annoyed and went to reception,…"
3069,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","First time stopping at this hotel & wont be the last! The rooms are spotless, the beds are so comfy I didn’t want to leave. The bathroom has an amazing walk in shower and the room has a fridge, with water, and a tea & coffee making area, that is all hidden away in a cupboard. The breakfast is delicious, a continental section and your cooked breakfast all made fresh. The restaurant staff are lovely, nothing is too much trouble, The hotel location is perfect for the AO arena, , Victoria station, printworks & the arndale. The only negative was our check in. I think the hotel had allowed to many late check outs so the rooms were not ready. Everyone was told to come back at the same time which resulted in long queues. The staff were apologetic and got us sorted. Don’t let…"
3070,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Had to wait in a queue for a prebooked! breakfast for 20 minutes each morning!!!!!! This is absolutely unacceptable! The fitness room does exist but can take no more than one ‘cardio’ and one free weights attendees at a time. The rest was fine. Rooms are clean and comfortable, a bed and other facilities are in good condition"
3071,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",Having stayed here before and have a lovely time we decided to stay again whilst attending a concert. This experience however was not so good! We arrived just after half 2 and check in states from 3. Lots of people checking and allowed to go straight to there room including our parents however when I came to us we were told by the girl that ‘your rooms still dirty’ and come back at 3. People continued to check in and everyone else go there rooms we had to wait till after 3. We then went down for a drink we sat at a table and asked for a menu the lady was very rude practically threw it us and was like it’s self service you have to go the bar yourself! However there was a gentleman there who kindly came over and took our order! The worst thing was breakfast what an absolute…
3072,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","I can’t recommend this hotel enough. Its location is perfect for the AO arena and accessing the Arndale Centre. Check-in was quick and easy when we arrived at around 5:30pm, and the staff were cheery and welcoming. The room itself was a twin room on the seventh floor. It was spacious and we loved the unique decor. The bathroom was clean and had a lovely, modern feel. The hand wash, hand lotion and shampoo and conditioner provided were fantastic - so much so that we enquired about purchasing some to take home. (A huge thank you to Colin who went out of his way to provide us with a bottle of this, as the company who make it do not deliver to Europe!) The beds were extremely comfy, and the linen was lovely and soft. We didn’t eat at the restaurant, however it seemed popular. …"
3073,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Great location within walking distance from town centre and transport hubs. Loved the design reminiscent of the history of the building. Rooms are comfortable and, although not huge, spacious enough."
3074,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Stayed as a couple for an overnight treat. Sadly check in was delayed as room not ready. However was dealt with briliantly, offered drinks and also given late check out next day. Stayed in suite on 13Th floor. Fabulous. Amazing bed and sleep. Views from balcony fabulous. One of the best hotel stays we have ever had. Reception,bar and restaurant staff all ver welcoming and professsional."
3075,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Had a fab stay here this week as a surprise for my daughters birthday. Called before to confirm it was a celebration and arrived to balloons and banners what a lovely surprise! Thanks to Jane and Aida on reception for decorating he room, you went above and beyond. The hotel is quirky and modern, comfortable rooms and a wonderful shower in the bathroom😀 breakfast was fa illusion and Leo was really friendly and service so quick ! We loved everything about our stay and can’t wait to return. Thank you"
3076,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Really impressed! We stayed here as it’s so close to the train station and the AO Arena as we were going to see a show. Nothing was too much trouble! Aida checked us in, was super warm and welcoming and ensured she answered any questions we had and noted my dietary requirements for breakfast (coeliac). The room was beautiful, very clean, gorgeous shower, lovely products and all the amenities you need. We asked at reception for the best directions to a restaurant we had a table booked at and Jay checked on the computer, wrote us directions and even came out in to the pouring rain to ensure we went in the right direction! Breakfast in the morning was beautiful, everything was catered for and clearly labelled which was fab for me being coeliac. Our server was Kaitlan who was so…"
3077,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Great location, the hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff were friendly and the hotel bar/ restaurant had lovely food. Would definitely recommend for a stay in Manchester, the price was very reasonable too. Was less than a 5 minute walk to the arena and train station"
3078,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",Lovely little room for a great price on a Friday night. What I didn’t bank on was hearing the music of a nearby venue until 2am! No warning or ask if it was ok to be near the venue. No offer of earplugs. No offer of a higher floor. Shame really as it’s a nice place. We were in room 120.
3079,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","When checking in I was told my premium room had been upgraded to a suite, which was a wonderful surprise and a great start to my stay. I ordered room service which arrived very quickly, the food was great and the staff who took the order and delivered it were both very friendly and professional. The suite exceeded any previous hotel room I’ve stayed in and actually made me want to stay longer to enjoy it more. When I went down for breakfast there was a mix up with my order, partly my fault. Just as I was getting frustrated and about to ask someone to check on my order, I saw Hirdesh had noticed I had been waiting too long and sent a colleague over to check on me. I was really impressed with his awareness and it turned a negative perception of the service I received at breakfast…"

Beautiful hotel with fabulous rooms highly recommend to anyone staying in Manchester, they’ve obviously trained everyone well and taking care of the finer details to make this hotel the best in Manchester"
3081,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","The hotel was extremely nice, and I want to give a shout out to staff member Ashia A. who was so helpful with me there. Everything was extremely nice, the only obvious pain point was the cost - but if it's in your price range it is definitely worth it"
3082,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Great location, right by Victoria rail/tram station and with excellent range of shopping nearby. Staff were all very pleasant although I suspect a bit short handed, but they answered all our requests very well. Rooms in the tower were interesting. Not square due to the shape of the building but mostly well appointed. A word of warning to anyone who does not like heights - if you are in a high room, do not rush to the window to look out. The windows are floor to ceiling so you get a great view straight down to the street below! Bed (KS) was very comfortable. Rooms have AC. Our shower was great, rainfall and hand-held although there was some temperature fluctuation. Supplied toiletries are nice. Wardrobe/cupboard space are a bit limited if you stay more than one or two nights.…"

3085,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Beware- terrible experience. I will not be staying at this hotel again, and wish I had booked elsewhere. The room smelled horrible (I still can’t figure out what it was… maybe mildew? It smelled almost chemical, like a cleaning product mixed with something rancid), the floor carpet was covered in stains, the bedding had holes in it, there was black mold in the bathroom, and the curtains had what looked like blood stains on them. I of course took pictures of all of this in my disbelief. The walls here are extremely thin to the point you can hear the conversations of your neighbors. If you want breakfast, you must prepay and make a reservation, which seemed odd to me. Housekeeping also just… didn’t show up to clean one day, despite me leaving early in the morning and not…"
3086,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Attended this hotel on the 12th march 2023. We had a lovely stay, the room was lovely and spacious. Helena took my booking she is absolutely amazing! always happy to help. This is not the first time staying at the hotel I have stayed a few times and i will continue to book this hotel when ever I visit Manchester. The dinner we had was amazing, the breakfast was amazing and staff were amazing! Everyone was so welcoming and attentive. Honestly the best stay I have had for a very long time. everything is walking distance, the Arena is literally round the corner so it was the perfect location for us.

3087,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",We had a wonderful stay over whilst attending the AO Arena. Check-in was so smooth and both members of staff were really welcoming and professional and told us the history of the building. The hotel is spotlessly clean throughout and the bar area is lovely and relaxing. I absolutely loved the tea theme in the room. The furniture and finishes were also beautiful. We both had a great nights sleep and couldn’t hear any noise. We chose to eat breakfast at the Ivy but would 100% stay here again in the future and would try the breakfast for ease.
3088,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",Wow what a hotel! Fantastic location to the AO arena (literally less than 5 minute walk!) check in was very smooth and friendly. Gorgeous room - we looked out into train lines for Victoria which I was worried would be noisy - didn’t hear a thing. Lovely comfy beds and amazing shower. We didn’t have breakfast as we felt it was a little pricey. Our only complaint (of sorts) is it would be nice to have a nice coffee machine in the room as the instant coffee didn’t suit the room. Overall we would definitely stay again.
3089,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Spent a Saturday night at this hotel. Had a fantastic stay. Reception staff were so friendly, smooth check in. Room was lovely and we had room suitable for the disabled so the room and bathroom were really generous. Breakfast was really tasty and the staff were really nice. We went to breakfast about 8.45 so it wasn't really busy. We were seated quickly and our food came 10 minutes after ordering. A really enjoyable stay I would definitely come back."
3090,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel",First time visiting the hotel and not the easiest journey to the hotel. With a worrying dilemma on route we were met with a passionate and caring staff who can only be described as angels in the hotel worlds. The fact that Aidia and the others went above and beyond for a guest showed a level of professionalism and compassion that I have not seen in a very long time. I have amazing confidence in the staff at the hotel and the atmosphere has been so welcoming. Thank you and see you again soon
3091,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Fantastic hotel in a great location. The curved corridor leads you to a gorgeous room with a super comfy bed, here is everything you need for your stay. Loved the rainfall shower and looked after by really friendly and helpful staff.

3092,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","The hotel staff were lovely and a true credit to the hotel! Our room 320 was comfortable, quiet and very clean, decor was lovely for a mid city hotel. Breakfast was enjoyable. Hotel is close to the A O Arena, train station, and local shopping and dining all within walking distance. Our Manchester trip to the lottery big night of musicals was truly great, a good nights rest and all the people we met made us feel welcome. Lovely friendly vibrant city!"

A special mention to the Operations Manager, Dinah, for all her help with some problems we had with our reservation. The hotel far exceeded our expectations. The bedrooms were large, well-appointed, extremely clean and the oversized beds were just what we needed for a great nights sleep. The breakfast was more than adequate . The hotel is perfectly located for shopping and dining out, a 5 minute walk from great restaurants and city centre shops."
3097,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","From arriving to leaving the whole experience was excellent, we were well looked after by Jane on reception. We decided to have our evening meal in the hotel, after Jane recommended the food, she was right it was very good, and we were well looked after by Aisha. These were the only names I remember, but the whole staff were very pleasant. The room was very good, the hotel is two minutes walk from Victoria Station, and close to everything Manchester has to offer"
3098,"Hotel Indigo Manchester - Victoria Station, an IHG hotel","Where do I start, this is a perfect base to explore the area with so many beautiful buildings and so much to do. From arrival at the hotel we had 5 star treatment from ALL the staff especially Jane on reception who went above and beyond. This hotel is so comfortable and the rooms were lovely and clean. The atmosphere in the hotel felt very relaxed yet so professional from the dining room / bar staff (who were amazing) to the chefs who made such an impact with the food. The manager should be very proud of his crew We shall be back most definitely Well done and look forward to seeing you all again 👍👍👍"

Couldn't be more helpful dealing with 4 women who couldn't make their minds up what cocktail to have :) Good choice on menu and can recommend chicken liver pate and fish and chips. Cocktails choice for me Long Island Ice Tea
3100,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We had a lovely old room, with a great view. Bathroom seemed brand new and the shower controls were actually easy to use! Dinner, breakfast and Bar were all very good. Great base to explore the North Cotswolds. Electric chargers best I've used."

Room was comfortable although not in main house. The gardens were glorious and the church was very interesting to visit.Will come back soon and stay longer."
3102,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,Great team and great food in a lovely setting ensured a most enjoyable short and relaxing stay. We will try the main house next time. Gardens are really pleasant to explore and the church should be visited.
3103,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"What a beautiful hotel! We've often enjoyed staying here but our last visit was before lockdown. We recently visited with friends, celebrating a 60th birthday and it was fabulous - the hotel has been renovated and has a fresh, more modern feel. Staff were fantastic, friendly and welcoming. The rooms have been decorated, new carpets throughout and new outdoor furniture - beautiful. The restaurant was lovely and we enjoyed our dinner and accompanying wine! And the weather was amazing too!! Thanks to all members of the Billesley Manor team - we will definitely be returning!"
3104,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"My wife and I stayed at the Manor for dinner, bed and breakfast to celebrate my wife's birthday. The Manor is secluded yet only a few minutes from Stratford-Upon-Avon for a walk around. The room was clean, we had a lovely view across the lawns and fountain. Food was great, service at all times was very good and attentive. Thanks to Pip who organised a small treat for my wife as a birthday gift. Would definitely consider returning."

The not so good, came for our wedding anniversary as we had stayed here quite a few years ago also on our anniversary and wanted to come back. The room we were given was in the outside buildings room 47, that was fine unlike the smell of sewers as you approached it and was also in the building but thankfully not in the room. One of the bedside lights did not work. No soap, shampoo in the bathroom dispensers. The rain shower worked but the ordinary shower did not, just a trickle and as there were no showers caps provided I could not use the rain shower. Didn't have time to run a bath as it took too long to fill so had a strip wash (not ideal). The food was nice at dinner but we had to ask for…"
3107,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"The hotel was beautiful but our room was very basic even though we had supposedly been upgraded to a superior room, our room was unbelievably hot, the window could only be opened slightly which prevented any fresh air coming into the room, didn't sleep properly all weekend."
3108,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,A stopover for a visit to Warwick Castle - great to sit in the garden and then adjourn to the dinning room to watch the approaching storm as we ate a delicious evening meal served by excellent staff. Finally retire to a room cooled by an efficient fan on the hottest night so far this year.

3112,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Spa reception staff are very unfriendly, bordering on rude. We were not welcomed, just asked to pay up front and not given any explanation of facilities available. We had booked 80 minute massages and were informed this would be split into a 55 minute body massage and 25 minutes scalp massage. This was not publicised in the spa treatment list. We said we would prefer more work on shoulders and back and were told this was not possible because ESPA dictated a set amount of time and no customisation was possible. This is ridiculous and based on previous ESPA experiences, patently untrue. No training has been given to staff moving in the corridors outside treatment rooms and all you can hear is banging of doors and clattering of items being moved. Not at all relaxing. With 5…"
3113,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Billesley Manor was the best hotel during our recent 2 weeks trip to UK. This is our third trip to UK and we have stayed in many hotels in London, York, Bath, Durham and in the Snowdonia National Park areas. What makes Billesley Manor hotel stands out amongst all others is the historic building that has been nicely updated with modern amenities and its staff’s exceptional service. The ground is beautifully maintained and the online photos don’t do justice. It’s a short 8 minutes drive to Stratford-upon-Avon for Shakespeare fans and 20 minutes to other charming Cotswolds villages. It’s an exceptional value for what this property offers. Strongly recommend."
3114,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"I had a 2 night break here with my wife and found the hotel fantastic. Ideal location near to Stratford Upon Avon. Staff, particularly in the restaurant, were lovely and so nice to chat to. Food was very good and grounds, particularly the Topiary garden beautifully kept. We will certainly return as one of the best short breaks we have had."
3115,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We had a lovely stay here, the facilities are really good. We enjoyed the pool and gym areas, there’s outdoor games to play and the grounds are beautiful. However, the service leaves a lot to be desired. A lot of the staff are very young and whilst friendly the method of service is very reactive (we noticed this in a few other reviews). Lots of glasses and plates being left around, dirty tables not being cleaned whilst groups of staff are stood in the corner chatting. I wouldn’t mind this as much if it wasn’t a 4/5 star hotel. Often staff would forget what you’d ask for and you’d be waiting ten minutes for a spoon or milk with your tea. Whilst the food is lovely it is fairly overpriced - this didn’t bother us as much as we had dinner credit included but I wouldn’t have…"
3116,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We held a seminar at the hotel, the staff were very helpful and were instrumental in ensuring the day ran smoothly. They paid particular attention to our delegates dietary requirements and were always on hand to answer any questions. Thank you!"
3117,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Second family visit for 1 night stay. First time Fantastic, second time good. Kids beds need improvement, fold out sofa beds old and highly uncomfortable for any children over 9. But all up a pretty good getaway for a night or 2. Restaurant relatively decent for a hotel. Bar nice"
3118,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,Thank you for a wonderful stay. Staff amazing. Room beautiful and clean. The grounds were magnificent. The couples we met were lovely. Booked through virgin experience and just upgraded room when we arrived.
3119,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"I recently attended the wedding reception for my son and his fiancé which was held at the Billersley Manor Hotel, the day was amazing and our overnight stay was very comfortable. I would very much like to mention one of the receptionists by the name of Pip, he was welcoming, attentive, helpful, and extremely kind, my 4 year old granddaughter had left her cuddly toy at home and was distraught when it came to bed time, Pip presented her with a cuddly toy of his own and she was delighted, and went off to sleep. This is above and beyond and we are all very grateful to him, he is an asset to Billersley Manor Hotel Louise Freeman"
3120,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,Billesley Manor Hotel stands out for many good reasons where most other UK 4* hotels fail miserably. The hotel was immaculate and clean throughout. The bedroom that we had was refurbished and elegant. The king size bed most importantly was comfortable. Pillows superb. All the staff were well suited professional and polite Extensive grounds immaculate Food good quality and well presented All in all a good 2 night break and value for money Will return Ken Cooper
3121,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"What a beautiful, peaceful location. The gardens and grounds are well kept providing a wonderful view from the terrace. We enjoyed an afternoon of cocktails in the sunshine overlooking the water feature. Our room was a good size, as was the bathroom with a shower over bath. All staff were friendly, with the perfect balance of being helpful with being obtrusive. We enjoyed a beautiful dinner, and the breakfast was varied, fresh and hot."
3122,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Our second stay at beautiful Billesley, which I can’t recommend highly enough. The hotel & grounds are lovely; the rooms are elegant & comfortable with everything a guest could need; the staff are welcoming, professional yet very friendly & helpful; the food both at breakfast & dinner was perfect. We had one of the best steaks ever on our second night! We didn’t use the pool on this visit but the spa looked lovely. You get what you pay for, Billesley is a treat & somewhere that you really don’t want to leave, always a good sign with a hotel. If only everywhere was as good. We can’t wait to return 😊"
3123,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,This was our second stay at Billesley Manor. We booked the 4 poster bed room as before. I would recommend booking directly with the hotel to get the best rates and rooms.The room was big and looks onto the gardens. The stay was perfect and although the hotel was full it was still peaceful. The evening meals are well cooked and look great. If you after a luxury break I would highly recommend this hotel. We hope to visit again.
3124,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"This hotel is set in beautiful grounds in the middle of the countryside, close to Stratford upon Avon. The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant was excellent. We really enjoyed our stay."
3125,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Billesley Manor is the perfect hotel to truly unwind and relax in. All the staff members are there to look after your needs, are friendly and welcoming. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. The gardens are beautiful with gorgeous planting, the common areas are luxurious and comfortable, bedrooms are elegant and include everything you need for a fabulous stay. Breakfast was excellent, with choice of hot or continental and dinner was good. A fantastic stay, just outside Stratford and one I'm keen to repeat very soon!,"
3126,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Stayed for 1nt to celebrate our anniversary, the hotel itself looks fabulous on the outside, however, that’s as far as the wow factor goes. The bedrooms are finished with to modern decor of average standard., nothing like you’d expect in a manor. The bed was far to soft for my personal preference, and I woke feeling my back was in pieces. The shower was fabulous, as were the staff. I was disappointed to discover I had to pay a further £29 for breakfast, which I thought was included in the £183 price. The breakfast itself was very mediocre, average quality ingredients, had to keep asking staff for milk. Disappointing experience. Wouldn’t return"
3127,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,I booked the Billesley to treat my wife and in-laws for a spa/pamper session. The staff were lovely and very helpful but the hidden charges were off putting. There is a 10% surcharge on everything which is a bit sneaky. There is only one vegan option which is quite frankly unacceptable in this day and age.
3128,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,We had a perfect stay at the Billesley Manor. The hotel and grounds are exquisite. The staff were incredibly helpful and lovely. The room was lovely and the pool was excellent! I wouldn’t hesitate to come back here! The food was delicious as well
3129,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Will definitely stay again! Beautiful room, beautiful grounds and we really enjoyed eating out on the patio thanks to the lovely weather. The swimming pool was very clean and had good opening hours. The hotel has a lovely atmosphere. We look forward to visiting again."
3130,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Lovely hotel, great location for visiting Stratford on Avon. Our room overlooked terrace and gardens. I would have liked breakfast to be served as opposed to buffet style because buffet was awkward to access."
3131,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Great location and facilities. Peaceful setting to get away from it all. Good rooms, not great soundproofing - interesting. Great pool and spa facilities (didn’t try treatments). Excellent gardens and grounds to relax."
3132,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"The actual hotel and grounds are beautiful. The staff were excellent particularly ""pip"" on the front desk who was so helpful and friendly. "" Raffy"" the bar tender was amazing, his product knowledge was excellent and he made the best white russian cocktails ever!!! We had a junior suite which was superb and stunning views. Breakfast was busy and a buffet but was delicious. We will 100% return."
3133,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We visited this hotel to attend a wedding and stayed overnight it is absolutely beautiful set in lovely grounds, very clean , very friendly staff we would definitely visit again. I would love to come and spend some time in the spa next time."
3134,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Fabulous hotel, friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful grounds and good food. Excellent value. They even provided sunshine 😀 the terrace was lovely to have a leisurely breakfast on and the topiary area of the garden was good fun. Beautiful period hotel in an excellent location. We will be back!!"
3135,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,Lovely property nice grounds and garden. Slightly overpriced for food quality. Enjoyed our stay. But felt it was expensive for the breakfast and dinner provided. Would have preferred a breakfast menu with freshly cooked food. Dinner a bit too ‘nouvelle cuisine’.
3136,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Attractive building in beautiful grounds with welcoming and courteous staff. Although we had no treatments we used the pool, sauna and steam room which along with the changing rooms were all in good condition. We ate in the bar rather than the restaurant and the food was fine. Breakfast was all self service and good but we would have liked more choice ion the dried fruit and nuts and seeds line."
3137,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"The hotel is beautiful and the surroundings are wonderful. I booked to stay as a relaxing day after a busy work schedule. It is such a shame that this didn't go to plan. The reception staff member was lovely and welcoming. however, this was where is ended. I sat in the restaurant for dinner which was okay but the bread arrived after the starter, which wasn't ideal but the food was great so not too much of an issue. The issue was the staff, from sitting in the restaurant to moving to sit in the bar, all I could hear were conversations between staff about other staff members. it appeared that a more senior staff member was asking the restaurant staff to ""stand up to"" another member of the team and went on to discuss in detail why. I understand there are always issues within teams,…"
3138,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We sent a couple of delightful days , the staff were friendly and most helpful. The Hotel and grounds were kept to a very high standard. Only negative the evening menu was limited and expensive when you had to add potatoes and Veg to the dish."
3139,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We booked a Cotswold Hotel break and had a really good deal for bed, breakfast and dinner on the first night. Mostly excellent. Food was stunning at dinner and the dessert blew me away. Only let down was the service was painfully slow. Breakfast was lovely. Pots of tea not a machine! Hurrah! Food again was lovely and well cooked. We were offered a breakfast time of 9:45, bit late for us, but understand that it’s too keep the food fresh and service moving. However, there was no bread for toast, at 10am. So we and another lady asked for some. The waiter was rather short with us and said ‘it’s the end of breakfast’. So if you eat late - eat quick, as apparently 15 mins is all that’s allowed! It’s not cheap, but it is quality."
3140,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,The grounds and gardens are excellent The room was cosy and very comfortable bed There were cobwebs above the shower and walls scuffed a little and dusty skirtings but otherwise good The reception staff were excellent as were the bar staff and restaraunt both morning and evening A very pleasant vist
3141,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We had a very relaxing weekend in this hotel, beautiful surroundings, lovely to sit in the garden in the sun and drink cocktails. Very peaceful especially at night. This a great location for visiting Stratford and we would stay here again."
3142,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"May weekend. Delightful in every way: lovely historic manor house well kept; beautful setting; rural approach via meadows, trees, gardens, fountain + topiary - near to Stratford - comfortable room - good dining - tranquil terrace for sitting - plenty of history to enjoy. Polite, pleasant, friendly, helpful, approachable staff."
3143,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"Beautiful, atmospheric hotel and spa in a peaceful location. Spacious, well serviced rooms,with great bathroom. Excellent spa and pool. Food and service outstanding....but the real asset is the staff!"
3144,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,From the minute we arrived staff were friendly and attentive. The hotel is beautiful and has a lovely feel to it. The food was very good. The bedroom was newly decorated and the bed super comfy. We would definitely go back.
3145,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,Well run hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Food good and nice ambience. I would choose a room in the main hotel rather than the annexes. Only slight criticism is there is no jacuzzi but pool very nice.
3146,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,OUR STAY WAS TO CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY AND HAVE SOME RELAXED TIME DUE TO OUR HECTIC WORK SCHEDULES. HAVING STAYED IN MANY HOTELS AND SPA'S IT WAS A COMPLETE PLEASURE TO STAY AT BILLESLEY MANOR HOTEL AND SPA. FROM THE MOMENT WE BOOKED IN THE EXPERIENCE AND STAY SEEMED DESIGNED TO ENABLE US TO RELAX AND ENJOY THE LOCATION AND THE STAFF THROUGHOUT THE HOTEL MADE US FEEL WELCOME AND RELAXED ALMOST AS IF WE WERE THE ONLY GUESTS. THERE IS NO SENSE OF BEING RUSHED DURING YOUR STAY AND YOU ARE AWARE THEY ARE THERE WILLING TO HELP SHOULD YOU NEED THEM. THE EXPERIENCE IS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE LARGE CHAIN HOTELS WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE A ROOM NUMBER RATHER THAN AN INDIVIDUAL OR COUPLE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO STAYING AGAIN FOR A LONGER DURATION IN THE FUTURE AND HAVE NO HESITATION TO ADVISE…
3147,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"We enjoyed our 3 night stay at Bilsley Manor. The atmosphere is very relaxed and we found the staff friendly and helpful. Our room on the ground floor in the manor was really nice and quiet, and the enormous bed was extremely comfortable."
3148,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"The staff, accommodation and grounds were amazing. It was quiet and tranquil. Nothing was to much bother for the staff. Definitely recommend it and also come back. Been touring the UK and by far the best hotel of the week."
3149,Billesley Manor Hotel and Spa,"This charming Country house hotel was authentic and very comfortable. The staff in all area were helpful, friendly and welcoming . The rooms and facilities were clean and comfortable. The food was very good if a little expensive. However the breakfasts were plentiful, varied and relaxed. I would definitely recommend the Billsley Hotel to anyone and will hopefully be returning."
3150,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"I had an enjoyable stay in a Quay view twin room. I picked the hotel due to the location, parking and postiive reviews. All lived up to expectations. Plenty of parking although £5 per day fee is charged on arrival. We didn't use the resturant as the veggie options weren't anything special but there are plently of great resturants and cafes in Dundee just a five minute walk from the hotel.But watch out a lot of places were closed on Monday and Tuesday. The only improvements to make it a five star stay would be better curtains. During the summer months it's stays light late into the night and early in the morning. The curtains didn't meet in the middle so there was always light coming through. Next time I stay, I'll remember to bring an eyemask."
3151,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Fantastic as always and room was lovely Room was very clean Reception team welcoming as usual and always smiling sorry I didn’t go for breakfast so couldn’t review restaurant Thanks for a great stay see you all again soon
3152,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"I have just returned from my 6th stay at the Apex City Quay Hotel and Spa in Dundee and enjoyed my stay, the dinner on Friday night was absoltely amazing, especially the fish and chips with excellent service but the only thing that was wrong with the restaurant in the hotel was breakfast on Saturday and Sunday with poor service, but apart from that the hotel was very clean and the staff were pleasant"
3153,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"2nd Time & Amazing Had a bad experience here just as covid was finishing around 2 years ago, HOWEVER, where some are quick to judge when it’s wrong, we have to be able to do the same when it’s great. The service was just right not too intrusive but in hand when needed, Very polite young lady and chatty, Not too long between starter and mains, Drinks were kept topped up. Meals were fresh and tasty, sesame Chicken, minute steak or the fish and also the side courgette fritters the wife had, all Cooked to perfection. Well done & Thank Emma for organising."
3154,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,The drain in our room smelled if the plug was not left in at all times. The shower flooded the bathroom if left on for more than a few minutes (i had to spend a good bit of time and most of our towels drying the room) Room was clean and large.
3155,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Very poor service from the reception lady , will not be staying in this hotel again. No greeting, no manners and not friendly at all. She needs to lighten up as will make Apex lose a lot of customers. Have put through a formal complaint to the manager."
3156,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Been to this hotel a number of times over the past 15 years. The rooms have always been first class both in comfort and cleanliness. The hotel staff are both friendly and helpful. However there has been a marked downturn in both the presentation of food during breakfast and quality. The hotel prides itself in the big W and S words of waste management and sustainability, which is fine - re-use of bath and hand towels etc. When it comes to meals and particularly breakfast which for some is an important part of the day they have dispensed with the previously perfect system of self service from heated plates of food to a now ordering hot food from a pre-selected choice. OK - its not what i would have preferred but happy enough to accept it - what I don't accept is being given food…"
3157,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Had a lovely stay at the Apex City Quay whilst visiting family. All the staff were great although Aileen from housekeeping was exceptional, a real treasure at the hotel! She went out of her way to find us some firmer pillows and arrange for maintenance to visit and fix our cold shower. These days when customer service can be in short supply she was warm, welcoming and a great asset to the hotel. We’ll definitely return."
3158,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Apex were very accommodating in requests that I had made, every transaction was smooth and pleasant. The room was very clean and well equipped. The pool is tranquil and the spa was amazing! Will absolutely stay again."
3159,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"We had a fabulous stay at the Apex, food and room were very good. We will be back to enjoy more of what the east coast has to offer. This is a really good location for visiting the Fife coast and seeing its beautiful sights. 😍"
3160,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Stayed fir radio 1 big weekend. Disgusting increase in prices over £600 fir 2 nights which didn't even include brekkie. Small room and the shower flooded the room every time. Staff were nice enough and location is good but expected more for the price. Not even any complimentary water.
3161,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"A lovely week in this hotel.Great location for tourist venues and for accessing city restaurants etc.Very happy ,friendly staff who supported each other in their work.Good food in the bar and restaurant and a spectacularly good Classic Martini."
3162,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"I've used the hotel twice now for business specifically because there is a spa. The spa is basic hits the spot when you need to unwind after a busy day of work. The staff are very friendly and this makes all the difference when staying away from home. Rebecca who works in the cafe helped me out when I was feeling a bit off the next day after an event in the hotel. Thank you, Rebecca!"
3163,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Very central. Excellent room. 534. Spacious and modern. Fluffy towels Plenty parking spaces. Attentive staff. Within easy walking distance of our concert venue. Always stay here when in Dundee. Very competitive price.
3164,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Lovely hotel, clean, staff friendly and helpful, within walking distance to town. Breakfast was really good plenty of choice. Everything you needed in the rooms from irons to hairdryers fridge and coffee maker"
3165,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"We have stayed at this hotel many times over the years for business. I decided to take my partner for the weekend but unfortunately our room was situated right next to an event that was taking place during our stay. We were unable to sleep or even watch TV because of the loud music. The hotel, room and staff were exceptional but unfortunately couldn’t resolve our issue. This is a lovely hotel but we may not be returning during weekends."
3166,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Fast booking on our travel in Scotland, first hotel for a reasonable price Parking (paid service) nearby the hotel. Close to the harbor and with a great view on Dundee friendly personal and a large very nice room"
3167,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"I stayed at the Apex 2 weekends in a row, first on the 5th floor, then on the 2nd. Both times, the staff were sweet, helpful, and accommodating. I arrived sleep deprived from the US, and the cleaning staff cheerfully gave me more tea, milk, and cookies. They worked around my odd schedule and cleaned when I was out with family. The front desk staff, especially Jade, were wonderful: Jade gave me a map of the town center, marked stores where I might find what I wanted, and asked how I’d done when I returned. The restaurant and bar staffs were equally accommodating, friendly, and enjoyable. Just a delightful place to stay with a great staff."
3168,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Excellent hotel. Was worried when driving up to the hotel as it looks run downfrom the outside. Room very modern clean and tidy. Food quality of room service very good. Staff friendly.brwakfsst was beautiful and coffee good. Was very surprised by how good this hotel was would definitely stay again
3169,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Took my friend for birthday treat. Well worth the money I paid for our experience. Highly recommended. Staff all so nice and friendly. Treatment at spa was so relaxing,we were so chilled out afterwards. Will def go again"
3170,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"It was a very good experience and a pleasant stay. Room was clean and the service was excellent .Quay facing room are best for the relaxing evening time. Hotel is closure to city , walkable distance to few places of attraction. SPA , BAR & RESTURANT are the must to experience !"
3171,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Noisy room due to people outside chatting/smoking often into early hour of morning. A peaceful early night wont be possible due to this. I was on first floor odd number so strongly advise you avoid this floor and side of hotel.
3172,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Food was exceptional and service very good! We had a small issue in the bathroom and it was fixed in a short time frame. They were very accommodating to our needs for our children and we enjoyed the location very much.
3173,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Central, free parking, excellent food, comfortable rooms - all you would expect . Would recommend for all travellers as close to all transport hubs and attractions. If travelling to Dundee again I would book without hesitation."
3174,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Not much from building on the out side but amazing on the in side. Don’t judge a book by its cover. We wanted do do loads but then ordered food and drinks to the room and never came out again was an amazing stay and would come back in a heart beat.
3175,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,This is an excellent hotel cit is lean and comfortable and provides easy walk to town centre and all the sights . The bathroom was luxurious.We wished the pool could have been bigger but we still enjoyed 2 swims
3176,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Great location and value for money. Friendly staff who went above and beyond to give golf course recommendations when I told the person at check in the reason for my stay. He took the time to give me a range of courses and share some of his own experiences
3177,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"This is our second time at the apex. The positive was the Spa area and swimming pool. A lovely area to relax. The negative, a booking in process that wanted the exact time for us to attend breakfast. In Covid times perhaps but not now. I wanted to wake up as a when and then go to breakfast at anytime before 10 and that wasn’t an option. Our room overlooked the water which was lovely but the windows were covered in bird ……. We had a toasted sandwich one evening and sadly it wasn’t impressive. We will be trying somewhere else for our next visit."
3178,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Great location close to motorway & local bars restaurants. Staff helpful and friendly Gym & changing rooms clean and good equipment. Restaurant & bar area very nice alot of options to choose from. Overall a great stay will be staying again soon.
3179,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,It's very close to city center with walk distance of 10min and a lot of restaurant and pubs. Gym was satisfied with as had the standard machines to practice on. Breakfast could be improved for us coming from abroad of UK have some other expectations then only toast on the International options as maybe a bun.
3180,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Great value spa DB&B deal. Spa very good, even treatment. Dinner was excellent which we were not expecting as was brealfast.booking treatments & dinner coild have been better. I had to call several times to arrange, more so re dinner for which there was no time choice."
3181,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"I booked me and my now wife at this hotel for our wedding night. Initially I used it as a hub for myself and groomsmen to get ready. The experience from start to finish was exceptional, the staff were prompt, kind and efficient - they even gave us a drinks voucher for our wedding day. The room - I booked the master suite, and wow, lavish and comfortable! We loved the complimentary rubber duck. The food - The service and selection of buffet and hot foods for breakfast was excellent. We would like to thank Apex City Quay for making our stay feel welcomed and appreciated on our wedding day."
3182,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Had a lovely weekend at the hotel . Staff were all very polite and very helpful. Location is good if you don't have a car as near bus and rail station . Room was spacious and clean ,breakfast set you up for the day plenty off variety . Will definitely be back"
3183,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Very comfortable, clean hotel convenient for the Discovery and V&A museums, railway station and city centre. Breakfast sausage slightly disappointing, but otherwise good with generally friendly and helpful staff. However, I do struggle with waiters young enough to be my grandson addressing me as ""mate""."
3184,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"A must if you plan a trip to Dundee . Staff are amazing and go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect. Rooms are clean and a great size and offer amazing views . Breakfast is amazing, loads to offer."
3185,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Great hotel and comfort, high standard, for a premium price, would recommend to others. The room was warm with no air con was the only down fall we could rate, food and drinks menu was also perfect, and location outstanding"
3186,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Had a great stay here with friends Super large room with great view to V&A and Tay Bridge. Comfortable bed. Large bathroom with walk in shower and bath. Used the spa which was great and food was delicious. Staff professional and friendly. Great location and free parking.
3187,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"We both had an exceptional stay and nothing was too much trouble. The staff went out their way to make us feel very relaxed and comfortable. The breakfast and bar menu was lovely, it’s always nice to try something new. The hotel is very central to the local tourist attractions. We will definitely be back in the near future."
3188,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Hotel and facilities fair Extremely warm in mild weather so would not recommend in warmer months uncomfortable sleep and breakfast quality of food not the best. Pool and spa facilities are a bonus Although can be very busy at peak times.
3189,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"A nice hotel in a fantastic location just a stone's throw from the V&A and Discovery Centre. Great staff who provided a warm friendly welcome. Good room with great view over the old dock. Bar service was slow but that happens when there's only one barman and he's swamped making cocktails. Restaurant fair, but having paid for breakfast I wouldn't do so again. There are plenty of coffee shops and cafes close by that provide better value... unless of course you need to eat early. Would I stay again.. yes, and I probably will."
3190,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Wonderful modern spotlessly clean rooms. We used the pool / spa, free lockers, it was clean and tidy. Friendly staff during check in and check out. There is a large car park right beside the hotel which has ample spaces. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone."
3191,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Apex Quay is a well appointed hotel close to the airport and city centre. I went with family and we booked two rooms. Our room had gorgeous views of the Quay. The bed was super comfortable. Bathroom had a separate shower unit and a bath and was well lit. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. We wanted to eat in the restaurant but there was no availability. The restaurant has an extensive menu that would please all palates. There is a spa on site but we didn’t get a chance to use it but hopefully for the next time to stay longer
3192,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Have very enjoyable stay in Apex hotel very good location and very friendly staff. Worth to recommend to everyone who want visit Dundee .I will definitely recommend and coming back for another stay .Many thanks
3193,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,We had a very warm welcome at the Apex. All staff members were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and spacious. The restaurant food was delicious including dinner and breakfast. Excellent location for sight seeing and shopping. Excellent value for money. Would definitely go back.
3194,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Stayed here for a staycation family break as we live in Dundee. The hotel itself is nice and clean and the rooms of a good quality if unspectacular. We had a lovely view of the city quay and it was nice to look out onto it. There is a charge for parking which frankly is a bit of a cheek for Dundee so be aware of this. The swimming pool is very nice and the changing rooms are great and despite it obviously being a popular gym for local residents it is very clean. The only downside with the pool is the splash times for kids which off season seem a little unnecessary. Unfortunately on the day we checked out because breakfast had taken so long we only had 15 minutes to get a swim and the staff were almost going to refuse us entry and had a bit of an attitude. The real downside…
3195,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Very nice hotel. Staff were very poilite and helpful. Very quick check-in. The family room was very spacious and clean. We ate in the hotel and pre booked the evening meal. Two courses & a cocktail for £21 each. The children's menu was really good. Good value for money & a good choice. Children ate free. We also ate breakfast at the hotel. The food was really good. A good choice at breakfast from the hot menu & plenty of fruit, cereal etc. There is a parking fee. Nice addition to the room was the rubber duck."
3196,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Took advantage of the Blamazing package. The stay was great. Lots of treats for children and lovely dinner menu for them. Dinner allowance and a cocktail was a great benefit. Although we didn't use them, the hotel has pool, gym and spa facilities"
3197,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,"Would thoroughly recommend this hotel Our second stay. Pool area is fab for families and a wee steam/sauna/jacuzzi too after a day out. Proximate walking distances to all sights such as V&A, RRS Discovery, Verdant works. Provided us with a walking tour map for our Beano fan which was fun. Also enjoyed the Beano Family Room with goodies which made the trip for our son. Close to local restaurants and hotel has parking. Room also has a window which opens - always a plus for us as I always get too hot in hotel rooms. Beds very comfy. Overall all staff were amazing - so friendly and helpful. Food in restaurant excellent and breakfast was above par! Would thoroughly recommend and always book directly with hotel for best deals and request."
3198,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,The hotel is nice. I stayed on the 5th floor the room was too warm. This hotel does not have Air condition. They provide a small fan and the windows will open to allow fresh air.they people were very friendly and the hotel is located on the water.
3199,Apex City Quay Hotel & Spa,Hotel and staff very good if you drink Bicardi find another Hotel they don't have any for a 4star Hotel this is not good enough this must be apex policy The group must get a deal on Havana club rum will not be back in any apex hotel
3200,Grange Hotel,"From the moment we walked in we were blown away by the hospitality and friendliness of the staff. It was my wife’s birthday and they made such a fuss. Our room was spectacular with amazing views over the village and hills. The bed was the comfiest we’ve slept in at a hotel, there was a smart TV, a nespresso machine in the room and a spacious bathroom. By far the biggest surprise and delight was dinner- this was exceptional. The presentation and flavours of the dishes were out of this world- and we have eaten in a few Michelin star restaurants before! We had dinner 2 nights and both were on par. As there is always room for improvements, our suggestions would be: there is a lovely terrace above the dining hall and it would be nice to have a few sun loungers on there as it is a…"
3201,Grange Hotel,"The hotel room had very Squeaky floor borads in room 202 although very nice room,the plumbing made a very strange sound through the night and woke us up.There should be a bar staff all the time but wasnt to be seen very often.At breakfast it was a self service system with very limited items,we didnt like the full english,not good quality.We had porridge what we had to order it took a long time to come to our table,the service was very slow.I had to ask for coffee and the staff would go to the table and bring this to us and the put it back on the table creating more unnecessary work for them selfs .The dinner was very good which we enjoyed."
3202,Grange Hotel,"One of the nicest, friendly hotels I have stayed in. The location was fantastic to see the local area and to get train to other areas close by. Although short-staffed due to unforeseen circumstances, nothing was to much trouble for any of them. The views and weather was fantastic."
3203,Grange Hotel,"I was hoping for an excellent stay at the Grange due to its 4 star ratings, but I was met with disappointment after my 2 night stay. The hotel hardly met the basic criteria of an average accommodation - the shampoo/conditioner was completely out, the tissue box was left empty upon our arrival, and room service was not possible due to the fact that no one would pick up the phone. The room was scorching hot at night even though the temperature was cool outside. We had all windows open and we still couldn’t get to sleep due to the heat. We paid £11 for 2 portions of ice cream and the order came out incorrectly. The only thing that my partner and I enjoyed was the bath we had in our room and the huge bed. If you’re wanting to stay here to visit Windermere, I would recommend staying…"
3204,Grange Hotel,What a wonderful hotel our room lovely absolutely first class staff nothing was to much trouble clean beautiful grounds really can't give this place enough praise can't wait to return in August thank you all
3205,Grange Hotel,"Our 2nd visit to the Grange Hotel, the first being in 2021 when some covid restrictions were still in place and times were different. Now however, things are normal and I had high expectations. The hotel is beautifully appointed and we had very nice rooms. The location is enviable, and we love the town - we had an excellent meal in Akhi, the Indian restaurant. The ladies on reception were very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was very good with lots of choice, although we were twice poured tea when we asked for coffee. However, it is all let down by the male bar staff. On each occasion we approached the bar, we were initially ignored. The bar area was always very quiet so it wasn’t because they were busy, and apart from once, weren’t even serving another guest. When eye…"
3206,Grange Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay, great views and very helpful and friendly staff. A character hotel which is right next to the station and close to town centre. There is an indoor pool if you wish to use it. Would recommend."
3207,Grange Hotel,"We had a fantastic overnight stay, gorgeous room with a roll top bath!!! Had a three course meal food was amazing and the fizz and canapés were a lovely touch. Staff were lovely pointed us in the right direction to go for a walk before checking in, and we had a lovely drink in the garden when we got back. Thank you so much for making our wedding anniversary so special."
3208,Grange Hotel,"Stayed at the grange for 1 night on a buy a gift voucher, it’s a lovely area but very quiet not much to at all the hotel itself is a massive place really nice outside for having a drink in the sun ,driving to here from a visit to bowness first was an experience you go through which really is people’s back gardens !! There is not much signs for here an the parking at the hotel is quite bad we did manage to get a space but other wise you have to park just outside it an if it’s raining it’s no good, the room we stayed In was very old fashioned BUT this is what the hotel is about I’m not having a go it’s just not for me an my wife’s liking breakfast was ok had to ask do they do vegetarian sausages they do but did not get offered these by the man who sat us down it was only when…"
3209,Grange Hotel,"Fantastic chef in the restaurant, but sadly breakfast buffet is of a much lower standard. Stayed twice in May, bedrooms are faded and en suites are in need of a major facelift. Many of the staff, particularly bar staff need trained in customer service."
3210,Grange Hotel,There was loud noise from a wedding until midnight. That ruined our first evening and made things very unpleasant. The hotel didn’t inform us about it before our arrival. Also they badly handled the situation when we complained about it. They made a discount when we were checking out but it was too late as our experience was already ruined. It is not always about money; it’s about great customer service and transparency.
3211,Grange Hotel,"The hotel was easy to find in an excellent location. We stayed to go to Cartmel races which is a 50 minute walk or a train to Cark and bus to the course. The hotel was lovely, picturesque and although a little bit dated in areas, this added to its comfortable charm. The staff were all very friendly so all in all a nice stay and will definitely go back!"
3212,Grange Hotel,upgraded to a front room with sea view but all you could see was tree tops unless you hung right out of the window looking to your left and the room was small with mildew on the grout of the bath tiling. We have stayed at Grange many times before and room 109 was not what we had been used to . The food however is just as good as it has always been
3213,Grange Hotel,"Just returned from a3 night break at the Grange hotel. This was for the start of our honeymoon and we were very satisfied with the hotel. Our room wasn't what we booked but far far better and bigger,a nice upgrade. Staff were very pleasant and helpful A lovely place and within walking distance to other venues We shall return again"
3214,Grange Hotel,"We have just spent a very comfortable and pleasant 3 nights at the Grange Hotel. The room allocated to us was not suitable due to our mobility problems. immedialtly upgraded to a much bigger and accessable room. The food was excellent, the service also very good, nothing too much trouble! Staff charming and helpful. We will return! If you want a quiet break in beatiful surrondings, close to the Lake District, Grange over Sands is the place to head!"
3215,Grange Hotel,"The hotel was very clean and staff were very welcoming. We had a very good massage off Beth. Beth was so welcoming and made us feel so relaxed and nothing was too much trouble. Also the bar staff were very friendly. I think we would return but in a different room, maybe one with a window to the outside of the hotel."
3216,Grange Hotel,"We just left after a two night stay at the hotel and had a brillant time, the facilities were great including the room and the spa area, breakfast was superb and the hotel is very well located for exploring the Lake District, cannot recommend the hotel and the friendly staff highly enough"
3217,Grange Hotel,"The location is all that is advertised, beautiful views set back in its own grounds with a pleasant seating area at the front of the hotel. The classic room was dated but charming. What made it for us was Grange itself which is a lovely small town sat on the estuary in the southern lakes, with good connections with a railway on the doorstep, beautiful views and small independent shops and cafes, restaurants and a lovely park and green spaces. Where the hotel could improve is the leisure facilities which are dated and a system which requires you to book a steam room/sauna and then requires a staff member to switch on so it never reaches the required temperature and is very disappointing. It needs to be left on during leisure opening times. We tried first night and then…"
3218,Grange Hotel,"We booked this hotel through secret escapes for our anniversary. Our initial thoughts on arrival were, this is not a “luxury” hotel as described. We felt parts of it were actually quite run down and very dated. The small grounds were quite over grown too. However, our room despite being small was clean and had everything we needed. It gave us a feeling of an old b&b not a hotel. The spa is very small and the pool area could definitely do with some tlc. With the secret escapes deal came pre dinner Prosecco and canapés in the lounge bar. However, when we went to claim this at 6pm we were told we would actually get this at dinner which we needed to book. We then found out that we had been booked in for 8pm! When asked why we weren’t told and that we now had to wait around for 2…"
3219,Grange Hotel,"Poor staffing levels and faded facilities mean that although the staff and food are both very good, the Grange feels like a 3 star hotel. Our room up in the roof space was very hot and the huge bathroom old fashioned and with nowhere to put anything. Low ceilings meant we continually banged our heads.Coffee making facilities were basic and the tiny tv inadequate. We never did find the tv controls. The food was good but the service poor, with too few staff who therefore couldn’t give guests individual attention."
3220,Grange Hotel,Myself and my partner stayed at the Grange Over Sands for a one night stay. The location was good and the hotel surroundings were lovely. Unfortunately the room we were allocated was dark and fairly small conferring the price we paid. No air con we was given a fan that didn’t work. No shower just a corner bath and given the 20 degree heat outside a shower was most definitely needed. We asked for another room with a shower to be told they were fully booked so no can do. On the confirmation email we were advised a shower would be in the room so false advertising! Breakfast was ok. You had to pay extra for a cappuccino so stick with a normal coffee which again was ok. Would I stay again no. Staff were friendly but overall the rooms need improvement.
3221,Grange Hotel,"Stayed here on a secret escapes deal, dinner bed n breakfast with canapés and a glass of fizz, booked an internal facing room we got a dark little room and you could smell the kitchen and cigarette smoke so we went to reception and asked to change to a room we booked then she said they were all fully booked and a couple of mins later we got one, this one was bigger and brighter and cleaner a bit warm but it was a lot better, but omg the bed at night time was so uncomfortable and the pillows were terrible we had such a bad nights sleep. The spa was ok sauna was tiny can’t comment on steam room because didn’t know you had to tell reception a time slot you would like to use it, the jacuzzi was large but needed a clean it was a bit scummy near the steps but the towels were good…"
3222,Grange Hotel,Fabulous lunch and afternoon tea today Olde worlde hotel with fabulous attention to service Tom served us promptly and remained friendly with professionalism Will come again thank you it’s been a lovely bisit
3223,Grange Hotel,"Great upgrade after a problem with the room key. Lovely room; spacious, clean, comfortable, with a view of the bay. No beer available on tap at the bar on arrival!! Limited choices for ale. Noisy in the corridor early morning. Breakfast was adequate, we did have to wait for sausages. Staff were polite and friendly."
3224,Grange Hotel,"The hotel was booked by my friend for a spa day, one night stay with breakfast included. -£175 When we arrived it was far too nice to be sat inside so ended up sitting outside in the sunshine. Drinks and food menu seemed a little pricy. Staff were pleasant. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but went into town, not a lot of choice,( although this is no reflection on the hotel) Cleanliness could be improved, lots of big cobwebs in the shower and bedroom. Decor seemed a little outdated. Bed was comfy enough. Breakfast was average. Overall I think it was expensive for what we got."
3225,Grange Hotel,"The hotel had lovely rooms and the staff were very friendly. The breakfast was quite good with buffet, but nothing special. All self service. The pool and spa are what led me to leave a poor review. It is quite unacceptable. The steam room is tiny and simply does not work. You are required to ask reception to switch it on, but it still doesn't work. I heard this from several guests in the hotel. The sauna did work, but it was tiny. Room for two people at a time. The jacuzzi however was dangerous with high levels of chlorine causing stinging eyes and fumes. There were three ladies who tried to use the jacuzzi and we all had to leave it after seconds. I did report this to the manager, but his answer to my complaint, was to justify everything that I said in defence…"
3226,Grange Hotel,"Disappointed that the room wasn’t as it was shown on pics. Family room small for our family, no coffee maker no private bathroom. Not the best view staring at a car park which is small and cramped no satellite channels just cable.. Lovely food and staff."
3227,Grange Hotel,Lovely hotel.Beautiful room.Food excellent and staff so friendly. Great location only about 15 minutes from Lake Cruises. Grange over sands so pretty and amazing view.Thank you fir a lovely stay and great weather!
3228,Grange Hotel,Excellent location within easy reach of motorway network and opposite railway station. Ideally situated within walking distance of town centre and promenade. Room well appointed and comfortable. Meals of high standard and excellent service at dinner - buffet style breakfast plentiful with good selection of traditional and continental fare. Staff throughout attentive and friendly.
3229,Grange Hotel,"Sweeping views from our bedroom over part of Morecombe Bay,looking onto Heysham Power Station. Accommodation spacious and comfortable. Food excellent with decent choices. Staff very friendly. Would return"
3230,Grange Hotel,"I needed a bed for the night after a work meeting, and the room was pretty cheap, so I thought I’d give it a go. General decor, pretty old-school, reminds me of my grandma’s house; also smells like it. Staff were pretty nice all-round, and very accommodating when I needed to change my booking from one week, to the next. Outside seating possibly the most uncomfortable seats I have ever tried to park my bum on. My room was small, but adequate, and it was relatively clean. The odd spider web, but that’s no bother. General decor of the room was pretty tired, which matched the rest of the place. There was a constant electrical droning noise in my room, which was relentless. I woke up at 3, due to the next door room needing the toilet (the walls are thin), and then couldn’t get…"
3231,Grange Hotel,First impressions nice decor. One receptionist at check in. I booked a large suite for the 4 of us and got given a room half the size with the wrong bed make up. I didn’t get what I paid for. Had to go back down and queue to tell them we have the wrong room. Told they had booked all the suites out and we still had 2 double beds so couldn’t move us didn’t really apologise. I asked for petals on the bed and request wasn’t done. Disappointing but not surprised considering attitude. Room dark and very warm with little air getting in. The steam and sauna awful and don’t work properly. Yes we asked them to turn on at reception still didn’t work. The pools chlorine levels on the second day obviously not checked properly. it was unbearable! all the guest eyes were stinging from just the…
3232,Grange Hotel,"Great food at the wedding reception and in the restaurant- couldn’t fault it. Service in the restaurant was ‘unusual’, verging on brusque and quite uncomfortable for my friend and I and the waitress who was doing her best. Slept really well in a very comfortable bed and looked forward to a hot bath in the morning. Sadly there wasn’t any hot water, had a bracing cold shower! No bath robes in the room but plenty of fluffy white towels and everything (apart from the high chairs - what a sorry state) was immaculate. A lovely old fashioned hotel which I would recommend,"
3233,Grange Hotel,Very fortunate having stayed previously got an upgrade to a very nice suite. The staff that are there are very helpful from reception to bar staff and waiters. Obviously still short of staff hard recruiting I hear. Food excellent at dinner really nice dining room. Breakfast fine. Still no Australian red wines? Overall situated close to station for travelling.
3234,Grange Hotel,"My husband and I had a lovely one night stay in a fabulous room, 226. The bed is huge and really comfy. Only slight issue is the talking you can hear clearly outside when the windows are open - think maybe the kitchens or something similar were on the ground floor below us. But it's a minor observation and did not spoil our stay. We had the 5 course meal which really was nice. The staff worked really hard - only 3 of them for an awful lot of guests. The dining room is lovely, albeit very bright for an evening meal. We enjoyed using the pool, sauna, and jacuzzi, and good they are included in the price . Nice there are plenty of towels for guests around the pool too. We came by train which is perfect with the station being directly opposite the hotel drive entrance. We…"
3235,Grange Hotel,It was a Beautiful room. The staff were very friendly and helpful.The food was excellent.. Lovely clean pool and jacuzzi. We would highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. We will definitely return.
3236,Grange Hotel,"Wonderful experience, the room was clean, comfortable and charming. The staff were friendly, helpful and professional. As for the dinner, what a joy! The service was excellent, given time between courses, no rushing, and the food was perfect. Couldn’t fault it, plenty of choice on the menu, prepared and cooked to perfection, each mouthful a joy and beautifully presented. We were mistakenly billed for two bottles of wine with our meal, but there was no argument when we pointed out this was a mistake and we had one ( which was a very nice red) but as said there was no suspicion, no argument, our bill was altered and a polite verbal apology provided for their honest mistake. So this did not make us feel awkward on checkout, so again a positive rather than a negative."
3237,Grange Hotel,"Lovely hotel in all aspects. Room , very comfortable bed, cleanliness, breakfast, friendly staff, pool & spa facilities great. Location is good, close to train station & sea front. Definitely will return"
3238,Grange Hotel,Absolutely lovely from ringing to confirm my room .was upgraded . Lovely friendly service... fantastic food fantastic room with balcony and woodland view Very quiet suite. Would recommend to anyone
3239,Grange Hotel,"Great hotel, good service and staff friendly and helpful. Lovely room, comfortable bed and good facilities. Breakfast was very tasty with lots of choice. Spa was nice, although the sauna and steam room would benefit from being bigger."
3240,Grange Hotel,We booked the Grange through Country Hotel Breaks as a DBB deal for my husband's birthday. Altogether we had a really nice stay and the Dinner was beautiful. As part of the deal it included a complimentary upgrade if available (depending on how busy the hotel was) we were shocked on arrival to be upgraded to one of the hotels suites. I've read lots of bad reviews for this hotel so wanted to give a balanced review of our stay Positives - the dinner at the carriages restaurant was just beautiful and the service extremely good. We were informed that the produce was local so I opted for the pigeon starter and the version. Both cooked extremely well. For pudding I had the creme brulee which was delicious. - the room we stayed in was beautiful. The bed was comfortable although I…
3241,Grange Hotel,"Overall we would recommend the Grange Hotel. Unfortunately we arrived on the day of a conference so parking was limited and the bar closed until 1 30pm so no bar lunch for us. The room was ok just a bit tired, we paid for a superior room so the view ws lovely, not a bad nights sleep but the pillows were rock hard. The best thing was our dinner in the restaurant, the chef should be commended 100% We will stay again at the right price."
3242,Grange Hotel,"This hotel has apparently changed hands recently (I have stayed here before). We were at a conference and the bottom line was the staff could not cope. The initial reservation was incorrect for me, 2 days not 3, despite it being confirmed in writing. The conference dinner took over 2.5 hours to be served, and there was no service of, for example, drinks or even water. The bar was hardly ever staffed and only 1 of the staff knew how to make drinks. One of my sheets was stained, the windows were dirty, and on day 3, the power to the electrical outlets in the room cut out. I was not the only person to have problems and many of us ended up comparing the place to Fawlty Towers. Now, with all of that said, the hotel location and peacefulness are hard to beat, the WiFi in my room was…"
3243,Grange Hotel,"Where to even begin… I had read some of the bad reviews prior to booking, and I hoped that they were just unfortunate couples/people, but unfortunately, all of the negative reviews of this place are very accurate. Different people have different expectations, but the way this hotel describes itself is absolutely not what you get. They use words and phrases like, and I quote from their own webpage,“ luxury, four-star hotel” and “ breath taking panoramic view” and “ finest, culinary experience in Cambria” and “ famous afternoon tea” and “ all our guests are VIP”. You don’t get any of this. This is a two star hotel at best, with a very poor and basic breakfast that does not include any fresh products or bakery /homemade items at all. Breakfast: For example, we ordered a two…"
3244,Grange Hotel,"Lovely hotel with lots of character and features in a good location near Grange promenade, town centre and parks. We chose the dinner bed and breakfast option which did not disappoint, the food was very good and always piping hot. The restaurant staff were all very efficient, friendly and helpful as were all the staff. We did try the pool and jacuzzi which were both very good being at a nice temperature and easy to use with plenty of towels available. Our room was of a large size giving us plenty of room, it came with a separate settee giving us chance to relax in the sun by the large opening doors overlooking the garden terrace area and sea view. A large bathroom was to be had this included a feature free standing bath and separate shower which was very welcoming. There was…"
3245,Grange Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights, loved the hotel. Great room with extremely comfortable bed and a large en suite bathroom . The food was first class, the staff very efficient and helpful . The only criticism I have is the bathroom could do with at least 2 hooks to hang some of the towels on .great location near the esplanade and ideal for railway station if travelling by train . We would recommend this hotel and would definitely visit again ."
3246,Grange Hotel,"Disappointed with the small room overlooking the car park. Spiders web under the window, toilet roll holder very loose, and toilet seat did not fit base leaving a gap. Overall hotel needs a paint job in places, scuff marks and bare wood. Staff shortage meant too busy to care. 10 min wait for breakfast."
3247,Grange Hotel,"Great location in Grange and right opposite the railway station. Staff at reception very friendly and helpful. The first room we stayed in was inward facing. The room was pleasant enough but I felt it was too ornate for such a small space and it was quite cramped. The second night was in an outward facing room which was much bigger. In fact it had one of the biggest beds and headboards I'd ever seen! (room 128). Breakfast on the 1st morning: I was happy with orange juice, toast and marmalade which was fine. I think the toaster needs adjusting or replacing as it toasts perfectly on one side yet leaves the other side anaemic. My partner had the self serve cooked breakfast and said that the bacon and hash browns were dried out and inedible. Everythink else ok though,…"
3248,Grange Hotel,Hotel was excellent. Staff where so friendly and helpful especially the staff at the evening meal. Food was good. Would definitely stay again. Only downside was the parking. 2 cars had not parked in but blocked access to the disabled spaces. Had to drop of my 93 Yr old mother and then park some distance away. Mentioned it on booking and told something would would be done. Left next morning and cars still there. Not a problem for one night we where there but might have been if staying longer. Parking in general was a bit chaotic.
3249,Grange Hotel,"The hotel has a beautiful exterior, with a lovely lawn to dine outside and sit in the sunshine. Unfortunately that is where you would be best placed spending your time should you stay here. Whilst the grandiose corridors and sweeping stairs being an air of awe, the inside of the hotels’ positive features list then runs shortly dry. The rooms while tidy were not the cleanest, they are dark unless you have a sea facing room as they have far too small windows to allow a decent amount of natural light in. The thin room walls and 2 centaurs old floorboards will ensure that there is little to no privacy and that you will wake the dead while moving around the room. One redeeming feature of the boutique rooms was the ornate bath in the room that provided much needed joy during the…"
3250,The Mandeville Hotel,"Stayed 4 nights at the Mandeville + what stood out was the staff: they were remarkably friendly + helpful + willing to go above and beyond to make our stay wonderful. Location is terrific, just around the block from the Wallace Collection and Oxford Street shopping, plus historic pubs (so many great ones like the Three Tunnes or the Duchess, many others), beautiful news, churches, parks and easy access to the tube to go anywhere in London. Also Oxford is shut to private cars and the walking is splendid so you can admire the amazing architecture and gardens. Hotel has plenty of amenities, including a great breakfast. We'll stay there again when we go back!"
3251,The Mandeville Hotel,"Great location in the bustling and newly-hip Marylebone neighborhood. Good-sized and elegantly appointed rooms - - the double shower plus tub bathrooms are oases of self-care. The breakfasts were excellent. But, the real value-added here is the staff - - unfailingly friendly, helpful, and efficient. We'll be back . . ."
3252,The Mandeville Hotel,Nice hotel and perfect location and professional staff specially mr.Amar he was helpful and makes our stay excellent by his helping Thank you mr.Amar and hope to see you again and will be my choice next visiting to London …………………………………………..
3253,The Mandeville Hotel,"My husband and I booked The Mandeville Hotel as we were meeting friends to attend a play at the theatre. The hotel was perfect! From the moment we called to drop our bags before check in, the receptionist and concierge were extremely friendly and helpful…to the moment we check out, nothing was too much trouble. The room was ideally stocked with all the supplies you would expect these days - tea/coffee/complimentary water/CO. Bigelow products in the bathroom. The shower attachment over the bath, plus the separate shower was also very convenient. Breakfast was delicious - a plentiful buffet display with the choice of egg preference. The whole ambience in the dining room and the hotel in general was calming, due to the efficiency and polite staff. We often take the train for…"
3254,The Mandeville Hotel,"Hotel was near so many amenities, bus lines, Tube stops, it was central to everything. Staff lovely, helpful, professional. Went out of their way to say hello, and nothing was too much to ask them. Clean, safe, affordable London hotel."
3255,The Mandeville Hotel,"I have been a regular customer since years ago, and I always enjoy returning to the Mandeville hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. It was my sixth stay at the same hotel and I found the location to be excellent, with a variety of restaurants and shopping options nearby. It was a clean, well-appointed, and comfortable room. It was extremely helpful for us to have the concierge and desk reception assist us. From our window, we enjoyed a magnificent view. The hotel offers five-star service in a peaceful and pleasant setting. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped."
3256,The Mandeville Hotel,I’m a regular customer since years and I always love to come back to the Mandeville hotel. The location is perfect and the staff is always very nice and helpful. Good breakfast and the rooms are well organized.
3257,The Mandeville Hotel,Just spent 2 nights at the Mandeville Hotel. Fantastic location close to Bond Street tube station and some lovely restaurants and bars. Hotel is very clean with friendly staff. Our room was sold as a superior room. I wouldn’t class it as superior to be honest. It was very small compared to other hotels we have stayed in and booked superior rooms. It was however very clean and had what we needed for a 2 night stay. Not sure I could have stayed for more nights in that size room. The room was very warm and quite noisy early morning. We didn’t have breakfast as we like to wander out and we didn’t use the bar. The bar looked lovely but on returning back to the hotel on both nights there was no one in which seems a shame. I would stay here again but would probably book one of the…
3258,The Mandeville Hotel,Nice centrally located hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Fantastic breakfast. Clean and nice. Nice short break near shopping and restaurants. When we arrived we were not given the type of room we had booked. It was a bit of a shame that we had to spend several hours solving a problem that shouldn't be there.
3259,The Mandeville Hotel,"The location was perfect for us, with many restaurant and shopping choices a short walk, but not far from Tube to the rest of historic London. Our room was very clean, efficiently laid out and comfortable. We found it easy to explore one destination in the morning, and return to the hotel before striking out to another. The concierge and desk reception were extremely helpful. The view from our window was divine."
3260,The Mandeville Hotel,"But the room so small and the TV has not more than 12 channels, the minimum, so for me, cost benefit, does not pay to stay there again, specially for business as was my case.And the fact nobody call me after I complain, it is a 0 for the service."
3261,The Mandeville Hotel,"Last night I dined at Reform Social and Grill at the Mandeville Hotel with a friend, for the umpteenth time. It is excellent value on the Groupon deal (3 courses each and a bottle of wine), the food is tasty, and the staff are super attentive and friendly. We shall return again and again. Thank you."
3262,The Mandeville Hotel,"We stayed at The Mandeville for 12 nights. The location is perfect: close to the subway and the Marylebone restaurants and shops on the High Street but on a quiet side street which assured us of getting a good night’s sleep. The other hotel guests were friendly and respectful. When it was time to pay the bill, our credit card failed. What to do 8,000 miles from home? The front desk staff worked around this unexpected problem with patience and understanding. Our room had a street view and was always clean and restocked upon our return later in the day. We also were not interested in staying at a hotel with a gym, spa, or pool since we weren’t interested in those services and didn’t want to pay for, but not utilize, those facilities. If we return to London this would be our first…"
3263,The Mandeville Hotel,Spectacular stay for week long visit to London. The people made this a memorable visit. Our third visit with Mandeville and one of the best at any hotel in over 45 years of travel. Will return again in the future
3264,The Mandeville Hotel,"Firstly I’d like to say although I’ve rated our stay as terrible that doesn’t reflect the majority of the staff that worked there, I’m referring to the gentleman that worked behind the bar the evening of the 20th May. We’d had a fabulous evening at the theatre and came back to the hotel at around 10.15, this it would seem didn’t sit well with the barman at all. We asked for three coffees and a glass of red, not too much to ask given it was a bar we were indeed sat in. He informed us that we could not have a coffee as he’d already turned the machine off, well please could you turn it back on as not all of us care for a alcoholic or soft drink, he reluctantly switched it back on and made us three coffees….lovely. We finished our coffees and thought we’d like another one, as he’d…"
3265,The Mandeville Hotel,"Five stare service. A very nice hotel in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood. Rooms are comfortable and well equipped. Nice bar, awesome breakfast and roomservice works fine. We were ten people from Finland, stayed for one night and all highly recommend the Mandeville hotel."
3266,The Mandeville Hotel,"me and my younger brother stayed here and it really is dead center to most things you will want to see in London upon first visiting! Since its so central, we found ourselves coming in and out often throughout the day which was so convenient. The staff is really chipper and have a great sense of humor which makes it all the more fun. The room was very comfortable and the towel warmer was definitely used. I recommend this place to anyone who is ready to explore London!"
3267,The Mandeville Hotel,"Lovely stay at the Mandeville, exceptional staff and service - noting Ken the Concierge who could not be more helpful - very well located. It does need a refurb - upholstery and furniture frayed and chipped - in bar area and foyer. The room we stayed in was a tad shabby - also at the back of hotel - which was very, very noisy - window impossible to open and close and needed to call staff to do this. Staff are exceptional and the most special asset."
3268,The Mandeville Hotel,"This hotel is perfect. Great location, well appointed rooms, exceptionally clean, great food, but above all this hotel has exceptional customer service. The staff are its greatest strength and why we keep returning,"
3269,The Mandeville Hotel,The hotel is perfectly located in such a nice area with a lot of nice restaurants and bars. The hotel personal is extremely friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast good. I can recommend this hotel for a stay in London.
3270,The Mandeville Hotel,A charming and comfortable hotel in a great location in central London. I enjoyed the restaurant and appreciated the good service by all staff. Clean room with good air conditioning. Bar area is a nice place to gather with friends and travel companions. I plan to stay again in the future.
3271,The Mandeville Hotel,"I stay here regularly for business and the staff couldn’t do enough for you. Very friendly and helpful and a special mention for Opi on reception who does a fabulous job. The rooms are spacious, immaculately clean and well presented. A lovely place to stay in London in a great location."
3272,The Mandeville Hotel,"After a four-year gap between London visits, I recently had a chance to return to the Mandeville for a couple of stays totaling 8 nights. I was happy to find the hotel has remained the same welcoming, comfortable home base I had enjoyed on previous visits. Both the rooms I stayed in - one a superior plus, the other a deluxe - were front-facing rooms in the original wing of the hotel (my favorite room location within the hotel), and they were spacious, filled with natural light, well-appointed, quiet, and comfortable. Although both rooms showed some signs of wear and tear, the housekeeping staff did a lovely job keeping everything immaculately clean. The service from all the staff I encountered was as welcoming and helpful as I remembered from previous visits. After a long day…"
3273,The Mandeville Hotel,I stay at the Mandeville regularly for work. The staff are so friendly and always go out of their way to make me feel welcome. The rooms are spacious and clean. The food and drink are great too. Thoroughly recommend.
3274,The Mandeville Hotel,Such a lovely hotel. The room was spacious and the bed was so comfortable. All the staff very friendly and helpful. Amazing location. St Christophers Place has lots of nice shops and restaurants. The hotel is in a brilliant location. You can literally walk everywhere. Would not hesitate to stay there again and to recommend to family and friends.
3275,The Mandeville Hotel,excellent west end connectivity to LHR and the city / southbank. Friendly and accommodating staff. Top helpful concierge. Marylebone is a lovely area by itself with several venues. Rooms are decent size for London too.
3276,The Mandeville Hotel,Two rooms booked and got a free upgrade! All staff very attentive and welcoming - highly impressed with the level of service. Rooms beautiful and a comfortable night! Will stay again and highly recommend.
3277,The Mandeville Hotel,Great hotel with very friendly staff in great location. Check-in was very smooth thanks to the very friendly staff. Rooms and bathrooms lovely and tidy. Bathrooms maybe a little bit small but still okay. Location is great with lots of restaurants and also the main shopping area Oxford Street close by.
3278,The Mandeville Hotel,Perfect location especially if you are needing to stay near Harley street. Hotel staff are incredible and so helpful. I booked last minute but was pleasantly surprised at how lovely the Hotel was. Will definitely stay again
3279,The Mandeville Hotel,"Situated in a quiet place near Oxford Street, this Hotel is the place to go in London. The reception team, the concierge, the housekeepers were always smiling and available for any worries we might have... A great stay. I will come back."
3280,The Mandeville Hotel,"This hotel is truly outstanding in every aspect of hospitality. The staff are exceptionally helpful, friendly and happy! The three concierges are just brilliant and they are always there to do your bidding or just for a good chat. The food in the restaurant The Reform and Social is outstanding. Breakfast is excellent with everything that you could wish for. The restaurant staff are an amazing group of people. Our room, albeit the best in the hotel was simply superb in every regard and the housekeeping was perfect. You won’t find a better hotel anywhere. If you are prepared to forgo a pool or sauna, then you will have a 5 star experience in one of Londons most vibrant and beautiful areas. And a bonus is that it is exceptionally quiet by the hotel. Walk 100m and you’ll come across…"
3281,The Mandeville Hotel,"We had a very comfortable stay and I highly recommend the Mandeville Hotel. Great location and I would definitely stay there again. We had a very comfortable room, the food was excellent, and the service was very efficient with lovely friendly staff."
3282,The Mandeville Hotel,"Have stayed at the Mandeville serval times now. The price is very competitive and the location is perfect for visiting London. Marylebone is a lovely area with plenty to do and see, places to eat. The restaurant at the Mandeville is very good and the staff are very friendly."
3283,The Mandeville Hotel,"This hotel is fantastic and so much better than the chains. The staff are so friendly and welcoming. Nothing is too much trouble. The standard rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable. The deluxe rooms are better and are quite spacious. I have stayed here a few times and it is my favourite hotel for proximity to Bond Street tube station and all the sights of London. The hotel is quiet at night too, compared to some larger ones. The breakfast has a good choice of foods and eggs are cooked fresh on order. I will definitely return and highly recommend this hotel."
3284,The Mandeville Hotel,"clean hotel and good welcome, close to many things, pleasant staff and concierge.room with coffee machine, fridge with drinks (paying) and non-smoking room, comfortable bed and quiet street.many things possible on foot, if you like to walk."
3285,The Mandeville Hotel,This is a real gem of a hotel. Much nicer than the big hotel chains. We were greeted so warmly on arrival. The rooms are spotlessly clean. Breakfast was really good with lots of choice. Eggs cooked to order. All staff are so polite and professional. Would love to stay again sometime
3286,The Mandeville Hotel,"Very clean, friendly and a great location. My (quiet and comfortable) room was just very small but then again I only slept there. The breakfast is rather expensive and as an alternative, there are several nice coffee shops nearby. I would definitively use this hotel again."
3287,The Mandeville Hotel,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, small room, beds very comfortable and clean. Carpet not very clean. Price p night too high. Breakfast very good, but poached egg on Avocado Toast was more than poor :-( Smell of cigarette smoke on the first floor was disgusting. But all over all a comfortable stay."
3288,The Mandeville Hotel,We chose a hotel near to Harley Street and shops. The Mandeville was perfect for both. Although rooms/bathroom were quite small they were well equipped and comfortable. The team on reception were very professional and welcoming (shame the same can't be said for the concierge when asked re taxi!)
3289,The Mandeville Hotel,"A wonderful hotel, perfect its position to go everywhere, because near the tube and the most important shopping streets. A warm welcome, attention to any details, high rate of cleanliness. An amazing and comfortable place where to stay"
3290,The Mandeville Hotel,"Wonderful hotel with the perfect location. Great team that went out of the way to help with sightseeing, luggage, forex, etc. Right from everyone at reception Sachin, Leena and Amar to Carlos, Madi and Ian at the concierge desk, we were warmly welcomed and taken care of throughout. We’ll definitely be back!"
3291,The Mandeville Hotel,"Absolutely superb hotel. Couldn't really fault anything. The staff on reception were excellent, the room cleaning and restocking service was great [very clean and tidy room], concierge very helpful. The hotel also has a great location - within a short walk from Bond Street tube station. We will definitely be back"
3292,The Mandeville Hotel,"Very good location close to Oxford street and Selfriges. Very service minded staff helping us sorting all our questions..Small, but clean rooms. We did not use the restaurant for either breakfast or dinner. Can recommend the hotel"
3293,The Mandeville Hotel,"This hotel is easily accessible, close to Oxford Street, Harley Street and other areas around Marylebone, lots of restaurants nearby. The rooms were clean and tidy and well appointed and the staff were friendly."
3294,The Mandeville Hotel,Overall a decent experience although I would probably rate it 3.5/5. The positives included the staff at the front desk who gave me a very warm welcome (not to be underrated) and the bar staff who were similarly friendly and professional. The hotel also has a great location and my corner room on the second floor was quite specious although the decor was a bit tired. I didn’t experience any issue with noise from the street (unlike some reviewers) but I did notice the noise from passing tube trains (guessing jubilee line into and out of Bond st.) every 3-4 mins. I don’t want to overemphasis this but it’s clearly there and slightly to moderately annoying for me. What’s interesting is I could find a single other review that mentioned it so may be my hearing is particularly acute.…
3295,The Mandeville Hotel,"Another great stay at this hotel with the usual friendly, helpful staff. We stayed in a standard room on this occasion and found the bed and room rather small, will choose a high room spec next time we book to avoid these issues."
3296,The Mandeville Hotel,"Look no further for an excellent hotel, great customer service, relaxing, quiet, comfortable, fab location, lovely rooms and great bar. Good value for money with great shopping all around and excellent restaurants nearby"
3297,The Mandeville Hotel,Beds and Linen were not up to standard - very uncomfortable beds.. first room was really bad and we asked to be moved.. second room was marginally better... also could use some better quality sheets. Staff and location was excellent.
3298,The Mandeville Hotel,"it was good experience at the center of London. Reception services are good, and Taxi reservation was just on time even early morning, it was excellent for first stay in London for me. Next time when I have opportunity to stay in London, will come again."
3299,The Mandeville Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel many years ago and loved it so decided to go back. Unfortunately the room was a little tired and could do with a refurb. However, it was clean and had all the amenities to make it comfortable. I particularly like that there was a bath tub. The breakfast was fantastic - great selection of cereals, fruit, pastries and full breakfast. So nice to have eggs cooked fresh rather than lie on a hot plate. The reception staff were friendly and I got into my room earlier than expected, plus they offered me an umbrella when it was raining. The bar is exceptionally good - a great atmosphere with friendly bar staff. My friend and I arrived back late after the theatre and just made the last orders by the skin of our teeth but it wasn't a problem to serve up some…"
3300,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We had the BEST time for our weekend stay and really felt like we had a mini holiday, which is rare in the UK. Everything about the hotel is quality. The decor, ambience, food, staff, location....they have thought of everything to make this a memorable stay. We cannot wait to return!"
3301,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"This is a beautiful Hotel located overlooking the bay with stunning views and a great vibe. The staff here were so helpful and friendly and nothing appeared to be too much trouble. The room was lovely, again with a bay view and very comfy bed. I will definitely be back."
3302,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Highly recommend a stay at this hotel. From start to finish we had an absolutely amazing stay. Staff were so helpful, Cherry was on reception and was so friendly, she explained everything we needed for our stay and went above and beyond which made the start of our stay wonderful.It was so pleasant to experience such a great environment, the staff excelled through all departments and the same excellent service was received throughout all areas. The outside seating area with gorgeous views of the harbour was lovely and we were waited on the whole time so could sit, relax and enjoy the sunshine while receiving constant care and exceptional service. The room was wonderful and immaculate, so many lovely touches (especially the complimentary gin) and chocolates and card for our…"
3303,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"An amazing Hotel... just perfect from start to finish... just the breakfast was a let down. Booked the hotel as a surprise for my partner following the G&T event, we were given an upgraded room overlooking the harbour, room 525 is absolutely amazing..!! The reception team were wonderful in helping keep the surprise, taking luggage from my car to the room and allowing an early check in. We had drinks and nibbles on the lawn pre dinner and then we ate at The Jetty, what an experience with amazing food and very attentive service. The only huge disappointment was the Breakfast with slow service and both cold tea & Eggs Royale being served."
3304,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Im very impressed with this lovely hotel in a beautiful location. Just like the images on their website, the rooms are beautifully decorated and the views over the harbour are special. We stayed 3 nights with my elderly mother in one room, myself, husband and baby in another room. The reception kindly adjusted the booking so our rooms could be near each other. All the staff are polite and friendly, in a genuine way. You really feel like you’re on holiday at this little gem of a hotel. We have enjoyed several meals at the Upper Deck restaurant which is reasonably priced with a good variety of options."
3305,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"A frequent guest at the Harbour Hotel and every time it gets better. Had a ground floor room with a terrace which was perfect to enjoy in the sunshine. There was a wedding when we were there who had a duet playing on the lawn, really nice to listen to while relaxing on the terrace. The room was spotless as always. Big comfortable bed with high quality linen. They've replaced the complimentary sherry with a larger measure of gin and 2 fever tree tonics, a better option in my opinion. A nice card and chocolates gifted as an anniversary present which was lovely. Had a massage in the spa, really good. Didn't use the other spa facilities this time, it does get busy and was a little over crowded on our previous stay. We ate dinner at The Jetty which was outstanding. Cocktails at The…"
3306,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"I organised a special family celebration break here way back in January. Since my mum has been in a wheelchair she hasn't been away anywhere on holiday and so it was really important that she could relax. The reception staff have been wonderful over tje last few months, I have called so many times to ask questions and they have been kind, patient and lovely. Alexandra really made sure everything was just right, checking their room was perfect, leaving birthday chocolates, ensuring it was accessible, she really went above and beyond helping us. My parents had a wonderful Seaview room with sun terrace which they loved being as it was gorgeous weather. It was also next to the lift so they could easily access everywhere in a wheelchair. We had a family access room which was very…"
3307,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,Lovely room. Full seaview. Very comfort bed. Spacious and tasteful. Really lovely large bathroom with bath and large walk-in power shower. Great service from the whole team. Reception were very friendly. Lynne looked after us with aplomb at check out and the lovely young lady who is a dead ringer for Phoebe Dynevor in Bridgerton checked us in efficiently and with a lovely smile.
3308,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,Went into your hotel Christchurch Harbour. To enquire about a baby moon for my daughter who is due in Aug. A very helpful Lady On Reception called Lynne. Was very pleasant and helpful looked after me and gave me all the information i needed. I will definitely be booking my daughter a babymoon at your hotel.
3309,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,I recently went to this hotel with adult family members on the recommendation of a friend. The hotel is in a glorious position with amazing views from the terrace and upper deck restaurant. We had wonderful weather and could therefore enjoy cocktails on the terrace. The room we had was a partial sea view room but had a wonderful outlook. A decanter of gin courtesy of the hotel was waiting for the gin lovers with ice and lemon brought to your room between 5 and 6 pm along with fresh milk. The only thing I would say about the room is that it was a little small and rather too warm at night . My sister stayed in the snug which despite its name was absolutely adequate but didn’t have a fridge. The service was poor on our first night with us just finishing our dessert at nearly 10pm…
3310,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,Excellent lunch and friendly i service.The restaurent manager so helpful . We will be returning to stay a few days.parking like a jigsaw but manageabl. All the staff smiling and friendly .my only moan dogs not under control on theTerrace.
3311,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,What a really fantastic couple of days at the Harbour Hotel in Christchurch. Food was excellent and the service very professional. We'd like to thank Lynne on reception in particular as she made our anniversary stay very special. Will definitely be returning to this hotel
3312,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Very Annoyed about my booking with this hotel. I booked a room for the 27th may yesterday morning at 7am for near on £400 - 12 hours later i get a call from the hotel to say they've just got my booking from 5pm, i booked it at 7am so not sure why they only just received this. I was then told id have to cancel my booking and i wouldn't have to pay a cancellation fee?! damn right i wouldn't. So i cancelled the booking and it's taking 7-12 days for a refund? but the money i paid out and now awaiting back was for the weekend away, now im stuck without the funds and without a hotel. I've emailed the hotel and of course, no reply. Absolute joke!"
3313,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"What can I say, we were treated like Kings and Queens! This was our second stay with the hotel and everything that we felt was wrong the first time was put right. Our stay was so lovely thanks to the wonderful staff and General Manager. Our room was spaces, we had a sea view, dinner was fantastic at the Jetty! It was one of the best mini breaks we have been on. A true testament to the Management Team, staff and of course the view and surroundings. Highly recommend visiting! What a place!!! The decking was outstanding great job on the refurb!!! So impressed, thank you xx"
3314,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Have stayed here several times, and it never fails to deliver. The service, food and accommodation are excellent. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff . Will defiantly be returning again . Hopefully very soon."
3315,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Booked a weekend break for my partner's ""special birthday"" and could not have wished for a better venue. Reception staff are courteous and efficient (even forwarded a charger left in the room - Alexandra) Harbour facing room was clean and comfortable, complimentary gin and ""garnish service"" appreciated. Dinner in the Upper Deck superb with excellent service by George. Spa is clean and fresh, treatments excellent from the very friendly Kate and Olivia. Very varied and quality breakfast. Afternoon garden service also excellent -sorry didn't catch waitress' name but kept up topped up with ice on a very warm Sunday. Don't get me wrong, the hotel is not inexpensive but you are made to feel special when you're there and you certainly get what you pay for."
3316,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"A very comfortable stay. Staff were excellent, friendly, accommodating and nothing too much trouble. The room was very comfortable with excellent panoramic views over the harbour, quay and spit. We would recommend this location for anyone looking for a friendly relaxing break"
3317,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"This hotel is in Mudeford,not in slightly run down Christchurch. An amazing location right on the water edge. It was everything you'd expect from this excellent hotel chain. Friendly staff, great service , stylish design. There is a pub in walking distance of you want to eat elsewhere."
3318,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Outstanding service from the entire team, this is how a hotel should be run. We have stayed here previously and love the location and the harbour views, so chose it as our base for our Daughter’s wedding nearby, there were sixteen of us staying and everyone commented on how fantastic the hotel, service, food and staff were. Thank you so much for making us and our family / friends so welcome."
3319,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"The two top restaurants in Christchurch are fortunately located in this hotel so you can look forward to a gastronomic treat! Good sized room with extremely comfy beds. Very well equipped bathroom. The spa is a particularly good feature of the hotel with an inviting indoor pool, jacuzzi and range of steam and sauna rooms. Nice relaxation room overlooking the sea one flight upstairs. You can easily walk down to the sea shore with panoramic views over to the Isle of Wight. The Jetty is a particularly fine restaurant with excellent food, service and sea views. Try the Eggs Florentine in the Upper Deck restaurant for breakfast - yummy!"
3320,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Great hotel for a short stay by the sea in a beautiful setting. The room was very clean, comfortable and well equiped. What really stood out was the level of service from all staff from the moment we booked until we left (calling ahead of our arrival to check any requirements, very good service at the restaurant, friendly and helpful reception staff, lovely people at the spa too). We will come back if the opportunity arises!"
3321,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"A most enjoyable stay, the staff were friendly and efficient, the room comfortable and the food In The Jetty was exceptional. The hotel is conveniently located overlooking the harbour inlet and a few minutes drive from the old town of Christchurch"
3322,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Fabulous two days spa break . Perfect time away for my cousin and myself . From the moment we checked in to the moment we left ,we wanted for nothing . Everyone was warm and welcoming .Thank you 😊 very much ."
3323,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Booked a room for the one night as we were going to The Jetty. Booked a Cosy room, which for one night was suitable. The hotel was spotless and the little touches of Gin etc in the room and ice and lemon being delivered was very welcome. We have stayed here before and once again must say that the bed is just so comfortable and the toiletries are excellent. Would consider staying here again if visiting The Jetty, such a wonderful experience."
3324,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Once again we absolutely loved our stay and wished we could have stayed an extra day....our room was wonderful with a beautiful view of the harbour. Every member of the hotel team we spoke to were incredibly professional and always willing to ensure we were happy....and without doubt we were ! Looking forward to returning to relax , unwind and enjoy more of the incredible food and cocktails ! Thank you all x"
3325,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"I have just spent 3 nights in the hotel with my 78 year old mother who has mobility issues. This hotel is absolutely lovely - the setting and grounds (right on the harbour), comfortable rooms, breakfasts (no extra charge for the alternative options which is a nice gesture), delicious menu in The Upper Deck restaurant, luxury spa and wonderful staff and service. Whenever we approached any of the staff, we were met with a genuinely warm, friendly, attentive and efficient response. I was particularly impressed with the courtesy extended to my mother at all times which made her feel like a really valued guest. A happy team means happy guests; it's not rocket science but is too often overlooked - other less well-run 5 star hotels would do well to take note. Particular thanks to…"
3326,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,Overall a lovely three day stay. It was our second time at Harbour Hotel Christchurch. The staff are professional and friendly. The dining/bar area lovely. Great views of The Quay. Every meal was delicious and satisfying. A minor criticism not to serve second course whist still eating first. This happened at breakfast on last day. My gripe would be the multiple hotel offers! Guests naturally talk and discuss! I emailed my booking as I was unable to speak with anyone! I wasn’t advised of any of the offers operating. I asked reception who advised call before booking. After my emailed my booking I did speak with hotel rep who omitted to advise me of any offers which resulted in breakfast inc only. I spoke with several guests who had £35 towards their dinner! One couple had a…
3327,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We're staying here at the hotel for our 4 day minimoon. We decided to eat at the Upper Deck restaurant ant tonight and my gosh what a treat we've had. Firstly, our waiter Zhivko was fabulous, so attentive, and even able to adapt the menu to suit. We had a surprise chocolate congratulations dish served before our dessert, talk about going the extra mile! The food we had was delicious, the fish so fresh and chicken beautifully cooked. The wine complimented our food well. We'll be eating here again as the menu is so varied."
3328,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,This is a review by Joanne Denley. We have just returned from a 3 night stay at CHH (our 5th visit). On this occasion we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary As always we were given a lovely warm welcome at check in. On this occasion we had opted for a cosy inland double room and were not quite sure what to expect however our room far exceeded our expectations. It was large in size with beautiful modern decor and quite a pleasant view over the roof tops at the front of the hotel. We were also given an anniversary card and chocolates which was a nice touch The standard of the food from breakfast to dinner was excellent and would compare favourably with our favourite Michelin star restaurant. Our compliments to the Chef and his team The reason for our mixed feelings -…
3329,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Sunday lunch at the upper deck, one of the best dining experiences we have had in years, great to find everyone form start to finish was spot on, also agree with previous comments the beef was the best we have had, service was excellent form everyone, special mention to George, who looked after us perfectly, excellent knowledge and suggestions added to our top dining experience. Thank you t"
3330,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Just had a few days at this hotel the staff are very accommodating, it has a home from home feeling. This hotel is a perfect location for weddings, family parties or just a quiet get away . There is a choice of 2 restaurants both serving beautiful food , breakfast was a high standard and starts you off to a good day would highly recommended this hotel"
3331,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Booked as a treat for my partner and I couldn’t have picked a better place. The whole experience was amazing. The location right on the harbour is stunning and the gardens and seating areas are set up really well to enable you to appreciate the views. We didn’t eat in the Jetty but we ate in the upper deck and every meal we had, including the breakfasts were delicious. I have to say the roast beef on the Sunday was the best I have ever had. The room we had was a delux harbour view and it was spacious and very clean. The bed was made each day and the room freshened up. The bed was a queen sized, huge and soooo comfy. The spa itself was really well set up and you can get in the lift near your room and get straight into the spa so nice and private to go in the slippers and…"
3332,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We got what we booked and expected. Our room had views of the sea as well as of a courtyard used for functions, during our stay it was used for a wedding reception. The food and service were superb throughout. I also had a facial in the spa section which was very relaxing. Keep up the high standards!"
3333,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We stayed for 4 nights and had the best time. We loved everything about the hotel, really comfortable room with complimentary gin/tonics, great start! Small details that make a big difference included, good tea, coffee machine, robes/slippers for the room and spa and a lovely bedding. We ate 2 nights in the waterside Jetty restaurant and 2 nights in the main hotel restaurant, the Upper Deck. Both excellent, high quality fish and shellfish beautifully served. Breakfast in the Upper Deck was great, good selection and all hot dishes cooked to order. We had lunch and drinks every day on the terrace, ranging from selection of starters to sandwiches. Although we went out every day to the beach, or boat trips we decided to eat in the hotel as it was so good. Spa fabulous! Best…"
3334,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We enjoyed another excellent stay at Christchurch Harbour Hotel. Well appointed room with harbour view. Evening meal in the Upper Deck restaurant was faultless, being well looked after by our personal server Phil."
3335,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"From a prior phone call by Tom (Guest Relations Manager), we knew that standards at this hotel would be high, and a warm welcome by Hannah confirmed what we thought. Trouble had been taken by a number of different colleagues to acknowledge our anniversary, which was a very nice gesture. Sadly the staff do not wear name badges, so we cant acknowledge them, but without exception all were well trained, and showed that they enjoyed working at this hotel. Guests receive a complimentary Gin in the room which is a nice touch, although it does not (normally), repeat if you stay a second night (Just Ask!!). We loved our deluxe sea view room , and enjoyed its well decorated and spaciousness. The bathroom was spotless and the bed the most comfortable you can imagine. We dined two nights…"
3336,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"A family break with my elderly mother.We couldn’t have asked for more.An excellent hotel with great service in a fabulous location. The food was wonderful, especially the fish dishes. We hope to return soon."
3337,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Staff brilliant, food excellent, no complaints - You even arranged for the sunshine to be out on every day. Difficult to think it could have been any better. Never been to this area before will certainly revisit."
3338,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Amazing service, great concierge service, lovely food. Really felt quite spoilt. Had a great family room ( 2 rooms) which was perfect as my son had his own space too. 3 days away felt like a week off. Without a doubt we will be back, it's a cosy, relaxed hotel, friendly and welcoming but with that extra touch of luxury. 3 generations all loved it."
3339,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Fantastic Stay Yet Again We have visited this hotel numerous times and it never fails to please. Rooms are lovely, bed so comfortable. Staff go above and beyond to ensure guests are made to feel welcome and their needs catered for. All staff are so professional, courteous, helpful and polite. Dined at both restaurants, but the Jetty is a special place, again never disappoints with both quality of food and service. Bar does great cocktails too :) What else is there to say, other than please continue to keep up this service, it is wonderful to still have a hotel where you are made to feel special and welcome."
3340,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Wonderful welcome by the staff, always very helpful. Room was lovely, had a sea view room on the second floor. Spacious with free gin and tonic in the room. Very clean, wonderful pillow and very comfortable bed. Great nights sleep. Spa facilities were lovely, pool, sauna, steam room, salt room, small gym but lovely quiet seating area with hot drinks and sun loungers. Only downside was the breakfast. Full English came with lukewarm sausage, non crispy bacon when asked for especially and a hard poached egg. Didn’t look very appetising at all and wasn’t the best. But everything else was great Hotel has a lovely setting right on the water with fab views across the harbour with free kayaks for the hotel guests."
3341,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,A really fantastic hotel which genuinely feels like a home from home. Every single member of staff we met were friendly and helpful. Lee on the front desk had a smile that would light up a room. The hotel is very luxurious but the atmosphere is relaxed. The location is perfect with sea views to die for. The rooms are spacious and well equipped with extremely comfortable beds. The complimentary decanter of gin and bottles of tonic water for your first night drink was a delightful touch… there’s even an ice trolley going from room to room to fill up your ice bucket and offer slices of lemon. A wonderful hotel in every way.
3342,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"I've always had the best service at Upper Deck! If you want to be treated like you're royalty, by friendly, attentive, courteous staff with amazing food & view, come here! We had great service from Harry- thankyou for making us so welcome."
3343,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Wonderful two day break at this fantastic hotel. All the staff ( Reception, restaurant, cleaning...too many to mention!) were so friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Our room was very clean and comfortable, with lots of 'little' extras. We had a beautiful view over the stunning harbour. We dined each evening at the Upper Deck Restaurant. We had two different fish courses both evenings. The various types of fish and seafood were perfectly cooked and presented beautifully, our compliments to the chef! All the restaurant staff were outstanding (including Phil!) but we must say a particular thank you to Rafael, who made us feel very special. Thank you all for a memorable stay!"
3344,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Every member of staff is brilliant, nothing is too much trouble, always friendly and helpful. Congratulations to all the team for making our stay lovely again. Unable to find fault with anything, the staff in the Upper Deck are really great. A bit unfair to single out one person but our vote goes to Tom!"
3345,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We arrived early, used the spa had a couples massage which was fabulous! The pool was lovely so was all the facilities in the spa. It’s a small spa and there were a lot of people in there for the space which made it hard to relax, but we used and enjoyed the facilities then showered and went to the hotel. We had a beautiful afternoon tea (which they gave to us early as we arrived earlier than planned due to the spa being busy). The view from the restaurant is breathtaking! The staff are all perfectionist from the bar tender to the waitresses. The food was divine. We then went to our room (we had a dulux suite) it was stunning but there were builders outside our window who were loud and looking into our room. They were kind smiled and waved but my husband and I were away on a…"
3346,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"We had a fabulous Easter Sunday Lunch experience, not only was the food exceptional - our waiter made our day that extra special, he was incredibly attentive, listened carefully to my friends deadly nightshade allergy, he went beyond any service we have ever had before! His name is Phil 😊🙏 hang on to him! We will be back thank you 😊"
3347,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,Another wonderful stay at the Harbour Hotel in Mudeford. We stayed in room 132 which had a separate room for the kids (it's our favourite) and was as clean and comfy as always. We ate at the Upper Deck every night - dinner and breakfast are consistently always amazing. Big thanks to Phil for excellent service last night. Kids have enjoyed crabbing in Mudeford and we have made good use of the pool and spa as the weather has been a bit hit and miss. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others. We will be back no doubt.
3348,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"Had a wonderful Easter weekend at the Christchurch Harbour Hotel. Room was excellent, staff are professional, friendly and very helpful. Food very good. Rooms very nice, clean . Can’t say anything but good things. Everything was lovely. Highly recommend it - will stay there again ."
3349,Harbour Hotel Christchurch,"I recently visited the hotel on a weekend break with my 11-year-old daughter. Despite a sleepless first night due to a noisy room, I have rated in excellent because of the way in which the hotel dealt with it. The staff member at reception (Alexandra) went out of her way to address the problem and ensure a positive rest of stay for us. The rest of the staff were quick to help carry bags, park cars and deal with other requests in a polite and cheerful manner. The hotel itself has a homely and relaxing feel to it. The meals we had were excellent (breakfast was our favourite!) and the spar was a lovely space to enjoy. We will definitely be heading back for another visit!"
3350,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"THE CLAYTON BIRMINGHAM WAS JUST SUCH A GREAT EXPEREINCE FOR ME It delivered on all fronts welcome energetic , friendly confidence shown we went over to match and after the experience of the stadium and the excitement of the match it was great to get into Birmingham centre and to the clayton hotel and just enjoy and relax after such a busy day the room was so comfortable and the evening meal was very pleasure with great service and attention the after dinner drinks very relaxing and a great nights sleep i loved the breakfast set up and you can come and goo and you are your own Master at the breakfast table. there was a great flow and no pressure on any of the guest while i was in the breakfast area. checking out was very good and interesting as the right…"
3351,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Visited on a Tuesday at 1pm for pre-booked afternoon tea. There was one person serving at the bar, doing the meet and greet, laying tables and serving up the teas, he could not be faulted as doing his best but a severe lack of staff left us feeling unwelcome and we did have to wait nearly 30 mins for food to come out. There was also some confusion over Clayton Gift card use which was taken off me on arrival as the person had never seen one before and needed to show the manager, we never saw it again!!! Food was nice quality although lack of sandwich choice if you don’t like spicy Cajun chicken, fish or eggs. On a plus side the cakes were very nice. The only member of staff doing everything needs a pay rise though as he was very polite and smart. Must say we won’t be paying a…"
3352,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Good stay, comfortable bedrooms, good food and wine in The Grill restaurant. Particularly good service from Paulette in The Grill restaurant. The Clayton in central Birmingham near Moor Street Station"
3353,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"I would come back again. The rooms are a nice fit; comes with an iron, ironing board and teas/coffees. However, no fridge. Not great considering the weather was 24 degrees. The bathroom is lovely with a decent sized shower. However, the room and lighting is not set up for anyone looking to get ready for a night out. There was a time I was attempting to get through to reception 8 times and there was no answer. When I did get through; the staff as a whole are very friendly and helpful."
3354,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Booked the afternoon tea as a treat for my fiancé and we had a great time. The food was delicious, we particularly liked the smoked salmon and cream cheese open sandwich and the chocolate flapjack. Derrick's service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend their afternoon tea."
3355,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"I have stayed here 3 times now, always when I'm in Birmingham. I booked a deluxe room and they gave me a free upgrade to a suite, it was unbelievable, bigger than my last apartment. Free stuff in the fridge too. comfiest bed ever, gorgeous tub, just amazing. Thanks so much Clayton Hotel. The food is also lovely."
3356,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,Lovely hotel. So close to train & bus stations plus all shopping locations. Staff from reception to restaurant and housekeeping were so friendly and professional. Special mention for waitress Paulina. Bar food lovely and so family friendly. Will definitely return.
3357,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"For the price we were paying, we expected great things of the Clayton, and unfortunately that just didn't happen, mainly down to housekeeping standards. As there were three of us, we had booked a room with a king-size bed and a single for our daughter. So on first impressions all was fine, size of the room wasn't huge but adequate. But closer inspection revealed there was only one bath towel and one hand towel for the three of us. Two tea-cups for the three of us, four hangers in the wardrobe, and half a roll of toilet paper in the bathroom (no spare). It was just all so random and weird. To be fair this was mostly resolved by a visit to reception, but all so unnecessary if the room had been set-up correctly and checked. Moving on to the restaurant, the food was very…"
3358,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Thank you Clayton Hotel, Absolutely amazing hotel, staff fantastic, Danniella, Mazz,Wendell,Yvonne, Melonia,Jess, Ladina and Ernest, made our stay very memorable, all staff from reception, check in, were very welcoming, bar staff again so helpful, our suite was spotless, 2 TVS in the room, with third TV in the luxurious bathroom, fantastic walk-in shower, the most comfortable super king size bed we have slept in, all modern facilities as you would expect, room temperature was perfect, we really did not want to check out, breakfast amazing with lots of choice,and cooked to perfection, thank you Mazz. Afternoon tea was amazing, 100% recommend the hotel, I am normally quite hard to please however I could not fault this particular hotel location fantastic, staff made the stay so…"
3359,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Had a lovely time staying here. Room was good and it’s very handy for the train station. Breakfast was also very good and I liked the decor of the communal areas. Super friendly staff. Big shout to Dominic in the bar, thanks so much for your hospitality."
3360,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"The hotel is clsoe to New Street and easy walking distance to other stations, teh Bullring and various restaurants The room I had was large, very comfortable, with a very well equipped bathroom There was good wi fi, sufficient cupboard space, an iron and ironing board, and a bottle of water was provided Reception was slick and friendly The bar was busy but friendly Thebreakfast was excellent with a lot of choices and good coffee A very good hotel"
3361,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Good hotel. Staff very friendly and happy to help. Room very clean and comfortable. Located just outside of Moore Street station, so perfect for central Birmingham. Room amenities are limited. No fridge. TV only had 3 channels tuned into it. Price wasn’t too bad for 3 people sharing, but if it had been 2, it would have been overpriced."
3362,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Beautiful hotel ( great price via Groupon) with amazing views from a great central location. Breakfast was brilliant. Rooms probably the nicest ever been to in the UK. The restaurant , bar and foyer area is lovely with fantastic comfortable chairs."
3363,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Fabulous room, very spacious, modern and spotlessly clean. Received a great service from the team on reception. Breakfast was a buffet style and I didn’t really enjoy it but it was a typical hotel help yourself set up. Would definatly stay again, recommended"
3364,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"The staff at reception are welcoming, friendly and happy to help if needed. The room was large, airy, extremely comfortable and thoroughly cleaned. The bathroom has all your wash needs covered, including bath salts for a relaxing bath. Bathrobe and slippers provided. Iron/ironing board, coffee machine, tea making facilities (selection of tea/coffee/biscuits) all provided. Breakfast is a help your self buffet with everything from cereals, yoghurts, pastries, meats and cheeses and everything you would expect on a full English breakfast. We had a fantastic stay in this beautiful hotel and will definitely be staying there again. I would strongly recommend this hotel."
3365,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,I had an afternoon tea experience given to me as a birthday gift.We went on a Saturday afternoon and its safe to say that the selection of sandwiches and desserts were top class and of course the gin went down well.We were served by Paulette who was extremely attentive and demonstrated a level of excellent customer service that appears to have gone from many establishments since Covid.Thank you for a fab experience!!
3366,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Lovely and peaceful, rooms were lovely and fresh, service was excellent too, had steak dinner for tea that was cooked to perfection, i did however slip up and ordered cheese and biscuits and my friend ordered the kewi and pasion fruit mess, that was outstanding Credit to Paulette superb service"
3367,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Great hotel, wonderfully situated, friendly staff. The lovely Paulette looked after us so well during dinner! Great value for money, hotel and rooms are spotlessly clean, breakfast is great value for money."
3368,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Myself & 3 friends stayed here for a night as we were attending a funeral. We arrived early & the lovely girl at the reception took our bags as we were too early to check in. We got some breakfast which was so nice! Great selection of cereals, milks, bread, danish's, cheese, hot food etc. We really enjoyed it. All the staff were lovely & helpful. We also had the pleasure of meeting the GM Eddie. Our rooms were so comfortable & we had a great nights sleep after a busy day. Thanks to all the staff for looking after us."
3369,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,Dined at the restaurant. Was served by Dominic with outstanding customer service. Burger was lovely as was the selection of wines. Staff are incredibly lovely and polite. Would definetly recommend for solo business travelers.
3370,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,Amazing afternoon tea and great service by Dominic! It was a lovely day and his service was very welcoming! Thank you so much for everything! Will deffo come back and highly recommend this to others x
3371,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,We booked an afternoon tea for a bridal shower. Derrick was very attentive and his service was amazing. He looked after everyone very well. He was also very good at remembering everyone’s orders without any issues
3372,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Went to the restaurant for afternoon tea for a work celebration. What a lovely afternoon and we would definitely recommend this hotel! The food and drink were of very high quality and presented beautifully. Also, the manager Charlotte was so nice and welcoming and so was our service from Derrick. Thank you to you both and a wonderful afternoon."
3373,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Excellent prosecco afternoon tea with my bestie celebrating her birthday. Great,friendly service and variety of food choices to be had.Also cater for dietary needs. Would come back and recommend to family and friends."
3374,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Had a lovely afternoon tea, delicious food.and fab service. Or server Yvonne was great as were all.of the staff we encountered. I would highly recommend the afternoon tea. The restaurant was lovely."
3375,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"We stayed here to celebrate my 30th birthday and got engaged the same night so was a big celebration for us. The appearance of the hotel was lovely, a shame that opposite is a huge building sight we didn't know about but that cant be helped. We were woken up at 3am by another visitor shouting, swearing and banging on the door opposite to be let in. This we could get over as it didn't last long and of course wasn't the hotels fault however when we checked out of the hotel we grabbed a very quick lunch and headed to the car. As soon as I got to the car i realised I had left my new iPhone charger plugged in. I called the hotel immediately who advised they would make house keeping aware and would post the charger out to me. Housekeeping then emailed me a couple of days later saying…"
3376,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"It’s a nice modern hotel in city centre area of Birmingham, walkable from train station , especially if you don’t have heavy luggage and you take the back street. The Lobby is small , looks modern yet lacks feeling of luxury. Hotel rooms are on smaller side , modern design, clean, lacking luggage racks , slippers and view especially if you are given a room on back of the building . Bath room is clean , only one towel was provided though. No bottled amenities."
3377,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"My family, girlfriend and myself all visited for a spectacular afternoon tea in Brum! The variety of sandwiches along with scones and desserts were all impeccable as was the attentive service from Prashant and Charlotte, thank you both!"
3378,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,The food was fantastic from the appetizer to the main dish!! The ice cream was incredible!! I recommend the bubble shrimp!! I would recommend to stay.The waiter Dominic was fantastic and well polite!!
3379,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Stayed with husband and daughter for one night on a dinner, bed and breakfast deal. Selected hotel based on the complimentary late checkout as wanted to return for a shower after completing the Great Run 10k. I cannot thank the staff enough for their kindness and service during our stay. Our extended check out request was not a problem. At dinner our daughter was given an entertainment pack and Paulina was happy to arrange for her food to arrive with our starters and served dessert in a timely manner so she could continue to eat whilst we did. The breakfast is definitely an experience not to be missed. We'd never had the pleasure of lemon drizzle and banana cake on a patisserie selection. The pastries are full sized and the protein yogurt/overnight oats were welcome preparation…"
3380,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"We went today for afternoon tea for my sister’s birthday,we really enjoyed it the staff were very helpful and polite we had plenty of refills on coffee and tea the sandwiches and cakes were lovely, I would highly recommend it. one of the staff members who's name was Prashant couldn’t do enough we will definitely be going back very very soon."
3381,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Excellent quality throughout. The room and bathroom are fantastic, the atmosphere in the hotel is very comfortable and welcoming. Great service from all staff, especially Paulette who catered to our every need at dinner, thank you!"
3382,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,Amazing hotel lovely room and service. Special shout out to Paulette who made our evening meal enjoyable and amazing service. Very central location and great accessibility to central Birmingham. Was here on business and great facilities for our training
3383,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Food was fantastic and so was Paulette! Couldn’t recommend her or here enough! Would definitely recommend, best experience we have had all weekend! Good prices, good food and great atmosphere. Can’t wait to go back again :)"
3384,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"We went for evening dinner off a Groupon voucher. To be honest I wasn’t expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised! The food was lovely, the cocktails were outstanding and we received excellent service from Paulette. I would definitely recommend."
3385,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,The rooms are nice and the place feels clean and looked after. Paulette her colleagues in the restaurant served me quickly and always politely even when extremely busy. The food is good too. I'd recommend the chicken curry.
3386,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Absolutely beautiful hotel, with friendly staff! The location was perfect, rooms were spotless and service at the bar was excellent. We were served by Dom, who was extremely professional and polite, and went out of his way to make sure that everything was perfect for us. The cleaning staff were also very friendly, and Tracey in particular was really helpful and lovely 😊 I would 100% recommend this hotel, and we will definitely be staying here again the next time we are in Birmingham!"
3387,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Fantastic afternoon tea , our 3rd afternoon tea here. Looked after by Prashant who made our visit exceptional nothing was too much trouble. Quality food in nice surroundings…. Will be booking a 4th visit soon."
3388,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,I have visited the Clayton Hotel in Birmingham on many occasions for Afternoon Tea. It never disappoints. Our server Derrick did a great job. We had a lovely few hours. Nice atmosphere and very good value for money via Groupon.
3389,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Lovely hotel and food. Our hostess and waitress Paulette was amazing, service with a smile 😃 nothing was too much of a ask and everything came out fast and hot. Would defiantly recommend a stay meal at the Clayton Birmingham."
3390,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Such a lovely afternoon that our friend bought us for our birthdays. We couldn’t fault our waiter Derrick, so helpful and happy to change anything we asked. Very accommodating. Highly recommended. Would definitely book to go again."
3391,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,Went for afternoon tea. Food was amazing. Our server was called Derrick. He made sure we were comfortable and provided quick service. Requested for no fish because of allergies and both Derrick and the chef was understanding and allowed us to have this change. Would definitely recommend and will be coming again soon.
3392,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Absolutely fantastic hotel and service was second to none. Not one glitch and everyone was spot on. Receptionist was fantastic and speedy. Everything you want from a hotel 10/10 The Person who served me at the Bar ( Dominic) was excellent and was calling me by name and his welcome and service I can only say it was a pleasure to be a customer and enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend if in Birmingham this is the go to hotel for service, comfort and fantastic experience."
3393,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Great food, brilliant service at the bar by Dominic. Very attentive to me and all the other guests. Knowledgable on the menu and drinks and nothing too much trouble. Room was nice, hotel very clean - all the essential amenities and located well in the city centre."
3394,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Derrick our waiter was great, very helpful, cheerful and nothing was too much hassle for him. The quantity of food wasn’t great, but for what we paid that was fine. I have never been to this hotel before so it was a nice surprise as it was lovely and clean."
3395,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"This was a beautiful hotel, the staff were extremely happy, kind and helpful. They did struggle to make a few things clear and book a dmfew things in for what we needed but made up for this with how friendly they were! Especially Austin who was the manager while we attended x We had a hen do there and used a private room space and the people who set up and served us were brilliant. We did have a 3 people room with only 2 towels which I thought was sa bit silly but luckily we had brought our own. Breakfast was extremely busy even though we had booked a head of time and the stuff did seem to struggle to keep up with the demand but the taste and selection was gorgeous. Overall amazing!"
3396,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"The hotel is brilliantly located for shops, bars and restaurants. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. For us as a family it was very welcoming and safe feeling, with no issue with our 13 year old daughter being in the bar at any time. Although there are no mini fridges in the room by default we requested in advance and one was provided. A special mention has to go to the barman Dominic who could not have been more professional yet friendly and made us feel at home, he keeps the bar spotless and even when he had no customers to deal with he kept busy at all times, cleaning, stocking, just generally making sure the bar was the best it could be! We booked a return visit before we even left! 😃"
3397,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"Afternoon tea was very nice. Just the right about of cake/sweet stuff, pastries were lovely! Our server Derrick was very attentive throughout, checking we had enough drinks. A lovely experience all round - Thankyou :)"
3398,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"A truly fantastic hotel stay - highly recommend this hotel; brilliant location, truly exceptional staff, amazing breakfast and the best cocktail I’ve ever had! It was also completely immaculate and super comfortable. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
3399,Clayton Hotel Birmingham,"I recently stayed at this hotel for a conference and I must say their front of house staff are absolutely exceptional they literally go above and beyond to help you ! Stephen and Deana helped me carry my Luggage in the pouring rain and faith was so helpful at check in, the room was spotless and bed extremely comfortable. I will certainly be back ! The staff make this place exceptional."
3400,Royal Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay here. The hotel is a short walk from all of the amazing and beautiful things Bath has to offer. The staff were brilliant, Tim on reception was always a friendly face whenever we crossed paths, Mike in the restaurant and the breakfast team were all lovely and friendly too. The food was superb!! We ate in the restaurant both evenings and there was plenty of choice for breakfast. The room was clean and spacious, the only issue with it was that it was rather warm, however a fan was provided which cooled the room enough to be comfortable (I completely understand that there are restrictions with air-con due to the listed building status). The only other thing the hotel could benefit from would be a bit of a freshen up, however that is for purely aesthetic…"
3401,Royal Hotel,All staff were very welcoming and helpful. Really did deliver a great level of service. We very much enjoyed our meals here and in particular the Champagne Cream Tea! Great location to see all the main interests of Bath.
3402,Royal Hotel,Nice hotel. Each room is quite different but ours was very nicely decorated and very clean. It was quite noisy thought as it was right on the road and traffic lights right by our window we could almost touch. Staff very helpful.
3403,Royal Hotel,"I booked this hotel for myself and my daughter. I wrote an email advising that we would arrive after midnight as we were flying from Nice to Bristol and the plane was delayed. They answered that they would be expecting us, that there was no problem. We arrived at around 1.00 am. We rang the bell but there was no answer. We rang the bell again. As there was no answer I decided to phone them. No answer! Phoned again. No answer. While I started knocking on the window I told my daughter to phone booking.com. While she was speaking with them, a man with a woman finally came to the door saying they hadn’t heard anything as they were cleaning upstairs!!! Cleaning at 1 am ?? When they knew we were arriving late?? We had been waiting in the cold with our luggage and were very tired not…"
3404,Royal Hotel,I bought my mum for a weekend birthday Mother’s Day treat. The hotel is situated perfectly the staff are friendly however I was very disappointed the rooms do not reflect what you show on the website. Our room was small needed updating it was very basic more like a 2/3* it was nothing like pictures on the website very misleading I wouldn’t recommend to friends. Also I was not told about booking a car park space (only 6) spaces had to carry luggage from multi storey with my 82 year old mum. Car park costing additional £50 very disappointed
3405,Royal Hotel,"Had a dreadful experience at this hotel. We booked a twin room for two on the “spa break offer” for nearly £600 for two nights. We pre booked the restaurant for the first night to 7 pm. We arrived and the desk manager told us we were the only ones in the restaurant that evening, thought it was odd as it was a Friday evening in a busy city. We were told to store our luggage in the cupboard and handed us a key. There seemed no security with this system and were nervous upon leaving our luggage there. We eventually into Bath to kill time and returned to collect room keys. The lady behind the desk handed us the spa vouchers and said we had to book the spa ourselves. We weren’t aware of this and she rudely stated it was in an email and we should have read it! She then said we…"
3406,Royal Hotel,"I would like to say that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at your hotel but unfortunately we are unable to do so. When we arrived at the hotel (early) we were greeted by a very pleasant male receptionist who understandably informed us that our room was not ready and to store our luggage in the cupboard. The key was handed to us, This made both of us uncomfortable as there did not seem to be any form of supervision over luggage going in and out of the cupboard. We returned to check in to a different receptionist who we felt was not the most helpful. We were given the keys to the room and the vouchers for the thermal spa. I unfortunately misread the email and did not realise I had to book us in. She advised that we go to thermal spa to see if we could get booked in, however she…"
3407,Royal Hotel,"Prior to booking this hotel we were absolutely assured that they had fully accessible rooms. Sadly, this was a misrepresentation as the room we were given was anything but accessible and it was impossible to manoeuvre around the room in even the smallest wheelchair. Likewise, there was a high step up to the shower and then a smaller one to actually access the shower itself, and there were no grab-rails anywhere in the bathroom - surely the most basic necessity for the disabled. For the more able-bodied, the bedroom was a reasonable size, the decor was tasteful, the carpet was clean and not stained and there was a very good selection of tea, coffee, biscuits etc. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were very good, Unfortunately the bathroom didn't match the same…"
3408,Royal Hotel,"Staying in Bath for one night, the location of the hotel was ideal as it was only a very short walking distance from the bus station. The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly from the reception staff to the bar staff. My room was comfortable and breakfast was tasty. There is a late check out time of 11am which helped to make a relaxing morning having breakfast. The check in time is 3pm but the receptionist helpfully stored my luggage until I could check in. I would happily have stayed longer and would book this hotel again if stayingin Bath."
3409,Royal Hotel,"Really enjoyed our stay here. We were here for the Lord of the rings concert. Room was lovely, breakfast room and food excellent. Really glad we stayed two nights. Friend really fussy about pillows and she said they were better than hers at home. Beds really comfortable"
3410,Royal Hotel,"Thank YOU all so much, what a great hotel! The staff are fabulous. Enjoyed the 2 night Thermae Spa Experience we travelled by train and the hotel is right opposite the station brilliant. Evening dinner was gorgeous, a wonderful sleep on comphey beds, fantastic choice on the hospitality tray, breakfast is the best ever, amazing quality even beautifully grilled tomatoes. The huge scones that accompany the champagne tea are delightful. It is very clear everyone works really hard to make this hotel what it is from the welcome at reception, being served food and drinks to to the great team who keep the rooms so nicely. The session at the spa is the icing on cake to this incredibly generous offer."
3411,Royal Hotel,"The Royal Hotel is without doubt our favourite place to stay in Bath. We have just enjoyed another two night stay at this gem of a hotel where standards are consistently high. The location is perfect for exploring all that Bath has to offer. Our superior twin room was spotlessly clean and tastefully styled with a spacious en-suite bathroom. Bathrobes and slippers were provided. The beds were very comfortable with crisp white quality linen. A generous hospitality tray was provided which included freshly ground coffee, Breakfast was excellent with a good choice of hot and cold dishes. We also had dinner in the Brunel Brassiere on one of the nights which was also excellent. What really stood out for us was the staff. A crack team are running this hotel. Nothing was too much…"
3412,Royal Hotel,"On arrival to be greeted by such a helpful, pleasant receptionist with a sense of humour was a pleasure. He took note of my disability and found a room that would suit my needs. The hotel is a little dated, but all of the essentials are of a good standard, and our beds and pillows were comfortable. Mention should also be made to the dinner. Not only was the meal of a good standard but the female waitress that evening was excellent."
3413,Royal Hotel,"A nice hotel with comfortable rooms and all required amenities. Enjoyed the breakfasts. Very near the station so can be a little noisy at night from time to time, but slept well. Convenient for all central Bath activities. Designed by Brunel."
3414,Royal Hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Royal. The deal was 2 nights bed and breakfast stay with added champagne cream tea, an al a carte dinner plus a voucher for a 2hr session at the Thermae Spa. A lovely time had by both of us and good value. The breakfast was very nice, the dinner superb and the champagne cream tea delightful! We found the staff very helpful and enjoyed lighthearted giggles with lovely Tim. The hotel is conveniently placed for wandering around the city and was not noisy. When we return to Bath we will certainly look to book the Royal again."
3415,Royal Hotel,"Perfect location in front of the train station and close to the historical center. Warm welcome, friendly and helpful personnel. Large room and confortable beds. Very good breakfast. I guess the only average element is the decoration : it could be renewed"
3416,Royal Hotel,"Our stay here was very comfortable. Friendly staff, big clean, warm room, with kettle for hot drinks. We had quite a journey here so, thrilled to just have to cross a road to the hotel. Meals here are pretty good, the dinner both nights we ate here was great and breakfast was smooth and hot. Easy to walk the ten to fifteen minutes into the middle of Bath and easy to relax, nice atmosphere in the bar. Would keep in mind to stay again if in Bath."
3417,Royal Hotel,"The most amazing food I've ever had, 3 courses each night and no supplements. Breakfast was delicious too. Room was clean, modern bathroom. Location is perfect if travelling by train and right near shops, only a 10-15 min walk to Roman Baths and Bath Abbey."
3418,Royal Hotel,"A nice warm welcome from reception staff, on arrival. This was followed by great service from bar and restaurant staff. We had the evening meal, and l can only say that we could not fault one single ingredient. Just like the breakfast the next two mornings. The food is way above the hotels 3 star rating. The décor is starting to look a bit dated, but it is clean. The 6 allocated car parking spaces are not easy to access, unless you are confidant of reversing into tight spaces. (I am) Overhaul a great stay, and we will not hesitate in rebooking the Royal hotel when we return next year. As there is so much to see and do, two days is not enough. Although we will let the train take the strain, as the Royal is opposite the railway station. Which by the way is next to the…"
3419,Royal Hotel,Had a lovely stay at the Royal. Room was very clean. The staff were so friendly and helpful. The bar has a lovely atmosphere and the breakfast was really nice. Perfectly located. Would certainly stay again.
3420,Royal Hotel,Lovely hotel. Very handy as right opposite train station. Took my elderly mum for a 3 night break. Had to book a double room as bo singles but bed was big enough for us both. Comfy bed & pillows. Room on the small side but comfortable. Could have done with some drawers for clothes. Tea & coffee tray in room but no milk on arrival. Reception got us some immediately. Handle on wardrobe broken. We were on 2nd floor but there was a lift. Goid job as stairs very steep & windy mum woukd have had trouble with them. Bathroom large with bath & toiletries provided. Room very clean. The best thing about this hotel were the staff. All lovely & friendly. Always chatty & helpful. They really made our stay. We had a breakfast & evening meal deal. Breakfast was great. Cooked breakfast was…
3421,Royal Hotel,"Stayed one night. I had a room with my daughter and my parents in an accessible room. Pros: Very friendly & helpful staff Nice evening meal, breakfast & service Located near city centre for access to theatre Our room - spacious bathroom Both rooms - cafetiere, biscuits etc Cons: I paid for an accessible room for my disabled mum & my dad. Room was not accessible - couldn't get wheelchair past the entrance as bed/chest of drawers in the way. My dad had to lift my mum from one side of the room to the other (he's 70!). Shower not accessible for my mum either as large step up to shower, no good for a wheelchair user - see photos. Lift said it was suitable for 2 people but once my mum in her wheelchair got in there was hardly any room. As my mum can't use her hands either, my dad…"
3422,Royal Hotel,"Very central to Bath, specially travelling by train. Hotel suited Bath in terms of decor ,plus surroundings. Food excellent, staff very friendly, prices reasonable . Very clean has everything you expect in room, from coffee to shower caps."
3423,Royal Hotel,"It was incredibly good to to be greet by a informative, happy and professional receptionist called Tim .The hotel had all what was needed and was excellent value for the money.Breakfast fresh,rooms clean and comfortable. Very central too."
3424,Royal Hotel,"I originally booked a room for a 2 night stay in February, due to a change in circumstances it had to be changed to a 1 night stay in March. Easily and quickly altered by Heidi at reception via email. On arrival, parked in the Southgate Shopping Centre car park which is about 5 minutes walk away. It was late, cold, wet and windy, but when walking through the hotel doors were greeted with comforting warmth. The room on the second floor was small and overlooked the front of the hotel which meant you could hear cars and trains going past, the hotel itself was quiet. The room was clean and smelt newly decorated, but the floorboards were rather creaky. I knew the hotel provided free WI-FI, but only discovered the code after a while when scanning a QR code which brought up an…"
3425,Royal Hotel,"We had a three night break here booked thru travelzoo. Excellent value for money. It’s a great location opposite the railway station and very central for all there is to see and do in Bath. Small car park available which needs to be pre booked and is reasonable cost. There’s no getting away from the fact that this hotel is a little old fashioned in style and slightly tired …..BUT ….. all the staff are excellent, way ahead of what you would expect in terms of service . Lauren in the bar and restaurant is outstanding, friendly helpful and informative, Chris and Tim[?] at reception were really helpful and Dave in the bar and the lady at breakfast taking orders were also superb as was Liz in housekeeping. We ate dinner here one night, breakfast on three mornings and lunch one…"
3426,Royal Hotel,"Not long back from a 2 night Travelzoo stay, which was great value. Hotel is in a great location, close to train station and a short walk to the city centre. The afternoon tea was lovely and great to have on arrival. Evening three course meal included as well, which was well cooked and really enjoyed. We found the hotel to be clean and tidy, a few creaks here and there, but then it is an old building. Only areas of downside were to be served tea in a China teapot that had a number of chips on the lid and rim, ended up having the same teapot twice and also the water jug at dinner had a chip on the rim. Also the room was unbelievably hot at night, despite having the window open, fan on and radiator turned off. It was uncomfortable trying to sleep. But all in all a good stay and we…"
3427,Royal Hotel,"We booked this hotel as we were meeting in Bath, one arriving by car, one arriving by bus. The hotel has very limited parking which you must reserve in advance - for a small extra charge - but is very convenient from the bus station, literally a block and a half, very easy walk away. The hotel seems like a bit of a lovely time capsule - narrow doors, front desk a bit hidden away, tiny elevator but helpful staff and cute old style, bar/cafe area. Rooms nice, clean with quirky taps/shower (this is England, after all), reasonable rates and wonderful, full breakfast in their small but pleasant ground floor restaurant. We booked the rate with the breakfast included which was nice to wake up to, though if you're willing to go out there are several cafes within easy walking distance…"
3428,Royal Hotel,"The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. The room was comfortable and, even though the furnishings were a bit dingy, nothing was broken or out-of-order. (Except for the Wi-Fi which didn't work during my stay. I was told it was to be fixed the day I checked out.) The breakfast was exceptional! Great location!"
3429,Royal Hotel,"We had a two night stay in March. We really like The Royal as it's convenient for the railway station, bus station and taxis, with most of the attractions within walking distance of the hotel, but the main reason for us regularly taking short breaks there is the high standard of service, food and cleanliness throughout the hotel. We've never been disappointed and are looking forward to visiting again in May."
3430,Royal Hotel,"We arrived at the royal hotel on 14th March 23, ( mid-week a Tuesday) it was a birthday present for my husband from our daughter so we were looking forward to the nice overnight stay. The car parking facilities were just 6 spaces ( which you have to pay an extra £10 for overnight) so i guess it was first come first served, lucky there were two spaces left, so a good start. We Walked the minute to the main entrance, we were greeted at the reception desk by a very pleasant male member of staff and was told where our room was . The room was small , a bit tired looking ,with coffee making facilities which we didn’t use at that time , bed was comfortable but a standard double . Compact and beasue comes to mind . We had a meal booked at the restaurant for that evening.so we headed…"
3431,Royal Hotel,"Enjoyed our overnight stay at the hotel. Comfortable bed & pillows! Staff were really helpful & friendly. Had cream tea which was really good. Evening meal was lovely. Sirloin steak was exceptional as was the prawn starter! Fabulous breakfast best hollandaise poached eggs done to perfection! The waitress whose name I've forgotten (long brown hair, nice & chatty) was really good at her job & she went out of her way to make your trip even more special"
3432,Royal Hotel,"We were a group of 7 on a visit to Bath. Parking was on site and so very handy and the railway station is opposite so very handy for two friends who travelled by train. The staff couldn’t have been nicer and the breakfast was excellent with plenty of choice. We liked the fact that the food was table service but you can also help yourself to pastries. The rooms were great and the beds were very comfortable. Overall, a relaxing place to stay."
3433,Royal Hotel,"My cousin became severely ill at your hotel recently and was not treated kindly. She is still getting over the experience. The manager was rude to her and no one offered to help her e.g. getting her a taxi. The least she should expect is that your staff help her and treat her well. She is also recently bereaved so I expect stress played a part in making her ill too. Your hotel is part of the hospitality industry, so you could be hospitable. Was there no doctor available to assess what my cousin's symptoms were? It was very frightening for her to be so very ill and alone surrounded by unfriendly people. As no one helped her, she was forced to walk to another hotel at 10pm to get a room as she felt very unwelcome at your hotel. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you how…"
3434,Royal Hotel,"We have visited The Royal on a number of occasions and the service has been consistently high. The reception staff are welcoming and helpful, the rooms are comfortable and spotless and the food and service in the restaurant has always been excellent."
3435,Royal Hotel,Great value stay booked through travel zoo. Fabulous location for visiting Bath and all its attractions. The staff were attentive and welcoming and nothing was too much trouble. Also the food was really good and very reasonably priced. Tim and Lauren especially went out of their way to make our stay memorable.
3436,Royal Hotel,"We booked this trip online as a deal to include one nights accommodation, cream tea, 3 course dinner and a glass of champagne. What can we stay from start to finish this was a really lovely trip. The staff are all so friendly and cannot do enough for you. Our room was spacious and clean with a good shower. Our cream tea was perfect. Three course dinner was such good value with a varied and well cooked choice. The hotels location is perfect, close to the station and close to all amenities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would visit again. Keep up the good work! 😊"
3437,Royal Hotel,"Great location, and easy parking in the nearby multi-story - it cost only £20 for just over 24 hours, which was considerably cheaper than my other option of getting the train, being as I only live in the next county. All the staff were friendly and appeared experienced and attentive. It's quite an old building obviously, so there was the odd creak here and there, but it was very clean and tidy, and none of the fixtures/fittings seemed tired or outdated. The bed and pillows were a bit too soft for my own preferences, and even without heating on it was very warm throughout the night, but again, that might be just my own tastes. Maybe aircon would be worth investing in to give customers the option. Overall, considering you get breakfast and the central location, this place is great…"
3438,Royal Hotel,"Lovely hotel, so central and welcoming. Staff are great and the food brilliant. Breakfast is really good quality, and the bar food is great with superb chips. If you are visiting Bath by train it is really convenient, with easy luggage storage."
3439,Royal Hotel,"Lovely hotel set over three floors right opposite the railway station and handy for just about everything. We were on a Travelzoo offer and stayed in a twin room which was large and had everything we needed. It was very clean, and we had tea and coffee making facilities and a large TV. The lighting was excellent - two big ceiling chandeliers and three side lamps. Large bathroom with a bath and shower. We ate in the restaurant and can heartily recommend everything. The waiting staff were friendly and efficient, and the choice on the menu both evening and breakfast was excellent. Thank you - we wished we'd been staying longer."
3440,Royal Hotel,"Been to this hotel several times over the years and it never fails to disappoint. The staff are always so genuine, friendly and attentive it is a pleasure to stay here. The dinner, bed and breakfast deals are great value, especially with a loyalty card. The food is delicious and plentiful. The rooms are charming and have lots of complimentary extras. Cannot fault it. Also being across the road from the railway station is an added bonus for those arriving by train. Looking forward to our next visit."
3441,Royal Hotel,"Had an amazing experience at the Royal hotel, staff very welcoming, room very clean. Tim was sooo friendly and helpful at the front desk. Made us feel like part of the family at the royal hotel. He was very knowledgable about the area, and was so lovely that he took the time to make us feel so welcome. We will definitely be making the royal our hotel of choice, everytime that we visit Bath. To be made to feel welcome like that is something else. I would recommend the royal to anyone that is thinking of visiting bath"
3442,Royal Hotel,"We all really enjoyed staying here . The location is perfect across the road from the station . From the warm welcome at reception, all of the staff we met were friendly , helpful and professional . The bedrooms were immaculately clean and the beds very comfortable. The meals we had , both in the evening , and for breakfast were well cooked , nicely presented and very tasty ! We all agreed we would stay here again."
3443,Royal Hotel,"Great location directly opposite Bath Spa railway station and not far from the main tourist attractions in the city. Friendly and efficient staff, comfortable room, great breakfast. Highly recommended"
3444,Royal Hotel,I had to stay in Bath very much at the last minute. I found the rate very competitive for Bath. It was also very convenient for where I intended to go in Bath. I have visited the Bar many times over the last 40 years but this is the first time I stayed there. The room was everything I expected and some nice little extras as well such as slippers. I had an excellent night sleep. All the staff I interacted with were excellent. The breakfast was great and I really enjoyed the quality and the choice. I would certainly stay again if the rate is competitive.
3445,Royal Hotel,We have visited the hotel many times which speaks for itself. The hotel is cosy and clean with helpful friendly staff and a busy hands on Manager. The menu and food are good and they do not penny pinch also the breakfast selection is amazing. Finally the location is hard to beat being close to the station and just a short walk into the city. There is also limited parking on a pre-book basis. Looking forward to our next visit.
3446,Royal Hotel,"Just had a Three night mini break to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. The hotel did not let us down. All of the staff were most welcoming, looked happy in their work and were happy to engage in conversation with the visitors. The food was excellant with plenty of choice. Omce again Thank You all. We will be back"
3447,Royal Hotel,"We had a fabulous one night stay in this hotel. Its very close to the centre of Bath, within a 5 minute walk. We also had a parking space for £10 for 24 hours of parking. The hotel has the character of what you expect in Bath, old and quaint. The rooms were certainly good enough for what we wanted and for what we paid. Very clean, a bath and a shower too. Rooms have tea and coffee making facilities too. They are not what I call really modern hotel rooms but in all honesty I think the hotel room suited the ambience of the hotel. Breakfast was excellent, cream tea was very good and the meal we had in the restaurant in the evening exceeded our expectations as it was very very good. The staff were very warm and friendly so we'd have no hesitation in going back again to The…"
3448,Royal Hotel,"Amazing little hotel in Bath, very central great location, reasonable over night cost, good restaurant & Bar, Room clean comfortable, warm. Amazing Breakfast. No much on site parking a little difficult as we had to park off site. A short walk and Expensive. We will stay again. Love Bath."
3449,Royal Hotel,"Excellent experience started with the lovely lady who helped us with our booking. Nothing was too much trouble. We went with Travelzoo and enjoyed top class friendly service, a lovely four poster room (extra to upgrade) and the most amazing food. It was well presented and delicious..I would rate both the food and service as 5 star. Some areas of the hotel were dated but renovation was in progress. Our room was very warm because the windows could not be opened. Rather oddly, there were chests of drawers but no wardrobe, just hooks. However, the bed was huge and comfortably and everything was spotless. The shower worked well and we had bathrobes.Interesting images and facts about Bath were all around the hotel and decor was elegant, with chandeliers and attractive furnishing.…"
3450,The Bonham Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at The Bonham for a week as part of our honeymoon. It was our first time in Edinburgh and we found the hotel to be perfectly placed. While it is outside the city center, it is close enough to walk in and far enough to enjoy the quiet and get away from the crowds. The staff were always friendly, helpful, and made us feel very welcome. Our room was beautiful, clean, comfortable and bigger than expected with a stunning view. The bed was harder than we prefer, but that was the only drawback. Overall we had a wonderful stay at The Bonham and we would be happy to come back next time we’re in Edinburgh!"
3451,The Bonham Hotel,"Beautiful hotel. The most beautiful hotel room I’ve ever stayed in! The room was spacious, beautifully decorated, with the most spectacular view. They left chocolates and snacks in the room every day. The beds were comfortable. The cleanliness was 9/10. I’m especially picky about that and in a hotel of this caliber/ price that should be perfect. The location was a 10 minute walk from the attractions of Edinburgh. We appreciated being close without being in the middle of all the commotion. We did not have any meals or drinks in the lounge but it looked lovely. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend."
3452,The Bonham Hotel,The Bonham's a hotel unlike any other I've stayed in. Be sure to talk to the staff about the history and how it came to be. Each of the staff members have obvious pride in their work and share their excitement with guests. We will return again and again.
3453,The Bonham Hotel,"Perfect location, perfect room, perfect staf, and perfect dining. This hotel is just lovely and we absolutely couldn't ask for more. The staff was so understanding and helpful, they really relieved some of our anxieties of being in a new country."
3454,The Bonham Hotel,"Fantastic hotel in a great location in a quiet neighborhood. We really enjoyed our stay here and the staff are all very friendly. Louie and Carl looked after us very well. The rooms are very nice, the dining room and bar are amazing. Can’t say enough, but I will stay here again."
3455,The Bonham Hotel,"Stayed a few weeks back, had a lovely drink before leaving, came back and large group had their kids in the bar at c10pm running around, causing chaos. 10:30pm still there. I think like almost everyone, a bar environment isn’t great for small kids at this very late time. After raising this, the hotel moved them 10m to a seating area but they kept on coming back to the bar. Hotel said there was nothing they could do and we should move on to allow the kids to play. It’s a small hotel, the kids were screaming, you could hear them from everywhere it was possible to have a drink, it was also c 11pm at the time. I spoke to the manager, who took 4 days to respond, didn’t acknowledge anything about me coming to him direct and not writing a poor review. Said that guests could…"
3456,The Bonham Hotel,"This is a very special, lovely place to stay. Far from the maddening crowds, but close enough to walk to all the sights and great restaurants. The rooms are redone and lovely. The staff is professional and friendly. Breakfast was excellent and No 35 their restaurant is a great choice. We look forward to our stay here again."
3457,The Bonham Hotel,"There would be lots of reasons to leave a bad review: The bar fish and chips had been cooked in oil that may have been older than the hotel itself. The room had a large skylight without any bling or curtain, making sleep after 5.00am virtually impossible. But - we still really liked it. Pleasant helpful staff and a general feeling of being in – well being in a slightly quirky British hotel. Would we return? Yes, but… We´d make sure to find a room without a skylight and we wouldn´t eat at the bar."
3458,The Bonham Hotel,My husband purchased a package for my 60th birthday WOW It was amazing and totally blew me away. It was excellent in every way The room The service Thé Afternoon Tea The Whiskey & Gin Flight Chris was so knowledgeable and extremely professional as he talked us through the Gins tonics & whiskey Louis was also lovely and very friendly We had a super time The service from the whole team was exceptional We were only sorry we couldn’t add an extra night as they were full
3459,The Bonham Hotel,"Hotel is in an excellent location, close to Princes Street but far enough away so not disturbed by city noises. Hotel staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. Only slight issue was the rooms were very warm and there is no air -con - but that is probably because the need for air-con in Scotland is not going to be very often! A fan was provided though."
3460,The Bonham Hotel,"Lovely room, very comfortable bed and pleasant bathroom, nice toiletries. Everything you could wish for is supplied. Breakfast was great, plenty of choice on the menu and really nice staff. Parking available as well."
3461,The Bonham Hotel,"The Bonham is hidden away on a quiet leafy street right near everything. A very civilized experience, both the hotel and the restaurant, and surprisingly affordable for such a luxurious setting and such excellent service."
3462,The Bonham Hotel,"Wonderful landing pad for exploring Edinburgh, even if you never leave. The history of the hotel is fascinating and offers unique rooms throughout. Clean, elegant, luxurious in all respects, we stayed several nights and loved it. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed, the restaurant and lounge spaces are varied and comfortable, making The Bonham the perfect place to stay or leave from. Friendly, professional staff helped us manage all our adventures so we could just delight in the city. Don't miss breakfast at The Painted Rooster around the corner!"
3463,The Bonham Hotel,"Our trip was planned so far in advance I can't even remember how I happened upon this gem of a hotel. We literally gasped at how beautiful the room was when we first walked in. The beds were huge and so incredibly comfortable. The view was spectacular. The bathroom was large and warm and lovely. We tried all the toiletries and thumbs up across the board. The coffee machine was great and we used it several times a day. All the staff at the desk, in the restaurant, on the phone, could not have been more pleasant. We moved to a more central hotel a couple of days later but immediately regretted that decision because the rooms were not nearly as nice (though it was in the center of the action). The Bonham is in a quiet area but you can get to shops and restaurants easily. Take the…"
3464,The Bonham Hotel,"Booked afternoon tea for myself and my friend for a Sunday afternoon. Warm welcome and shown to our lovely table in the Bay window. We ordered a glass of prosecco, and the staff checked for any dietary requirements. I ordered the Rooibos tea, and my friend opted for the Earl Grey. The selection of sandwiches, scones, and cakes was delicious. We managed to finish everything - the perfect amount. Very reasonably priced. The only letdown was the couple sitting at the other table in the bay window. Presumably, they had been staying and were waiting for transport - their bags were everywhere, didn't move to allow us to sit down. Sat with their feet on the furniture and oblivious to those enjoying the dining experience - no fault of hotel, just inconsiderate people."
3465,The Bonham Hotel,"Pro - Very nice hotel, perfect breakfast, ideal location: quiet + transport proximity + 20min walking distance to all major attractions Con - no airco means if it is hot outside, it will be double hot inside, no smart TV"
3466,The Bonham Hotel,"Beautiful and stately boutique hotel in a quiet neighborhood away from all the city noise and traffic but well within walking distance of restaurants and attractions. Very spacious room and bath, comfortable beds, lovely restaurant and bar area."
3467,The Bonham Hotel,"My lovely son and daughter in law booked my friend and I into this hotel as a special overnight treat whilst we attended a concert in Edinburgh, we are both in our seventies. Beautiful hotel and one of the cleanest i have stayed in. The bedroom was very comfortable and supplied everything needed for a break. The room was spacious and as stated exceptionally clean. We had an evening meal and breakfast everything was perfect and food served on heated plates ( my pet hate is food served on cold plates) ) The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. I have no hesitation in recommending this very well situated hotel and will certainly return in the future. Thank you all."
3468,The Bonham Hotel,The room was OK. Wifi on the third floor was weak and sometimes not at all. As it was our last night in Scotland we had lamb chops in the dining room. It was the worst meal we ate in Scotland in nearly three weeks of travel. The apology for the worst food was weak or non-existant. After complaining to the Food Manager the next day at checkout he said he was sorry - then charged us full price for the lousy dinner. What a sorry way to treat a paying customer who is staying in the hotel.
3469,The Bonham Hotel,"Our stay at the Bonham Hotel in Edinburgh Scotland was absolutely amazing. At check in our room was upgraded to a suite because of the length of our stay, 10 days. We had a beautiful view of the surrounding buildings. The staff were exceptional in every way. So if you are planning some time in Edinburgh please don't miss your chance for a 5 star experience at the Bonham."
3470,The Bonham Hotel,"We thought this was a lovely hotel. It was close enough to be walkable to all of the major sites you wanted to see, but far enough away in a quiet neighborhood. The hotel was beautiful and the accommodations very comfortable. Our bathroom on the top floor had a lovely skylight and views over the river in the back. The people were very helpful and made arrangements and phone calls for us. The drinks were excellent, too."
3471,The Bonham Hotel,"Good location and comfortable room /suite but service needs a big upgrade. Breakfast is expensive considering products do not look freshly made (fruit juices, pastries, waffles etc). This hotel is not far from Princes Street and most restaurants/attractions etc"
3472,The Bonham Hotel,"The Bonham Hotel has a perfect blend of modern relaxing attitude and gorgeous paintings on the wall, historical building and every comfort. The staff are all great and both friendly and professional. The breakfast is everything one could want....really good coffee....really comfy and stylish rooms"
3473,The Bonham Hotel,"Great hotel, great location. Our room overlooked the gardens to the front with a huge window and fantastic bathroom. Comfortable bed (dressed with cushions and bolster), coffee machine and everything you’d expect from such a hotel - safe, hairdryer, complimentary water and fridge. Good value breakfast and dinner. Wonderful staff, really friendly and couldn’t be more helpful."
3474,The Bonham Hotel,"We stayed at the Bonham for a flying visit to Edinburgh. Really simple booking (direct with hotel). Arrived a little early so had a snack in the bar while room made ready. Very comfortable room with great views. Took evening meal in bar, which was very tasty. All staff helpful and friendly. Stay was just too short !"
3475,The Bonham Hotel,"As it had just been my nephew’s 21st birthday, we treated him to Afternoon Tea and fizz on Saturday. As usual it was delicious. The staff are always attentive and efficient. The Bonham is our favourite hotel for food in Edinburgh. Added bonus is it’s dog friendly. Thank you for a lovely afternoon."
3476,The Bonham Hotel,"The Bonham is a tastefully appointed boutique hotel in a quiet area that is close to Dean Village and Princes Street and easy walking distance to main sites, restaurants, pubs etc ... Staff are helpful, friendly and professional. Room was not large but very comfortable, with complimentary goodies and great coffee machine. Bathroom was spacious and very nice. We did not eat or drink at the hotel but the lounges and restaurant were beautifully decorated and inviting. We felt this was good value for a higher end hotel experience. We found the room got a bit warm at night, but this was not a big issue."
3477,The Bonham Hotel,"Centrally located in Edinburgh with quaint rooms and an inviting lounge, the Bonham is a great location from which to explore this amazing city. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The room, while small, was well appointed with a lovely view and everything is in walking distance… the train station, the Royal Mile, the Tram to the airport. Highly recommend."
3478,The Bonham Hotel,"Our stay was amazing, the location was ideal tucked away but a short walk from all sights and restaurants.the hotel and staff exceeded all our expectations. We hope to come back when we visit Edinburgh again, and would highly recommend to anyone visiting here."
3479,The Bonham Hotel,"We got married here on New Year's eve. Most beautiful hotel and the festive decor and atmosphere was lovely. Food was excellent. We had 22 diners and everyone enjoyed their meal. Drinks, disappointing whisky selection, nothing fancy. I had one Tia Maria and then they ran out and the wine I ordered was ran out too. Rooms are stunning and luxurious :) would love to return. Amazing location esp for fireworks at the castle. Breakfast selection was gorgeous."
3480,The Bonham Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, onsite parking. Lukas and staff go above and beyond, breakfast/bar staff friendly and accommodating. Stayed room 111 Fabulous. Cleaner exceptional, no problem asking for more towels. I love the old worldly feeling, interior design gorgeous. This hotel should be graded higher than it is. Usually 3 times year visit. Next year company coming from Boston, USA and Atlanta USA whom I'll also be bringing to this hotel. It is what they would expect for accommodation. I would also like to thank Lukas and staff for arranging taxi for us. I won't stay anywhere else in Edinburgh. Can't give enough stars"
3481,The Bonham Hotel,"Easy check in, well appointed comfortable room, welcoming bar, excellent breakfast and very nice staff! Plenty parking on adjacent streets and you can prepay into the next morning so no worries about tickets."
3482,The Bonham Hotel,"From the moment I walked into The Bonham, I knew I was in for a treat. It's located a short walk from the ruckus of Princes Street in a tree-lined neighborhood. I loved walking into my room and hearing classical music playing on the vintage style Roberts radio and seeing the a little bag of shortbread cookies on my pillow. And the chandelier! There was plenty of coffee and tea with packets of real milk and bottles of water. The huge bathtub was divine after traveling all night and exploring the city until my room was ready. Room Service was speedy and they even waited to deliver my sorbet so it wouldn't melt. I would absolutely 100% return to The Bonham and recommend it to everyone."
3483,The Bonham Hotel,"What a fabulous hotel, centrally based and just a short walk to Princes St, and Stockbridge. A well maintained, clean, comfortable and generally lovely hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but others who did said the food was very good: wee did make use of the well stocked bar, though."
3484,The Bonham Hotel,"The Bonham Hotel is, in my experience, one of the best hotels in the UK. This is the second time I have stayed here and, on each occasion, have been made to feel very welcome - which is especially important when travelling alone."
3485,The Bonham Hotel,"A truly superb hotel in Edinburgh. Very friendly, attentive and accommodating staff. Food was very good too. The beds are amazing ... firm with Egyptian cotton sheets and a tremendous duvet... real luxury!"
3486,The Bonham Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, rooms were comfortable and clean. Excellent choice of food for breakfast. Not a fan of a shower over a bath but that's personal preference. Umbrellas provided by the hotel came in handy! Great location, able to walk to Edinburgh Castle and plenty of restaurants nearby."
3487,The Bonham Hotel,"Planned a weekend away for my wife’s birthday and wanted to book somewhere a bit more special, The Bonham didn’t disappoint. From waking into the stunning lobby it was a first great impressions and this carried on throughout. The staff were really friendly and helpful, the room was of a high standard and clean, even got a choccy on the pillow! We had booked breakfast as didn’t want to waste time wondering around the city for food. There was a good menu choice, all the usuals and vegan options, but I went for the Full Scottish and it was delicious (first time trying haggis). The bathroom could’ve done with a touch up but this is being overly critical. The bed was comfy, the free use of umbrella was a nice touch, and it was nice a peaceful stay."
3488,The Bonham Hotel,Hotel lovely and warm. Staff very friendly. Spotlessly clean. Always enjoy my stay several times during the year. Location is good and great you have parking at the hotel. Would recommend. Staff at reception very friendly.
3489,The Bonham Hotel,"Immaculately clean. Stunning furnishings, art work, and decor. Responsive and friendly staff. Great location on quiet street. Delicious food. Used breakfast buffet and room service which were wonderful. Comfy bed, quality linens, and warm and cozy European flair."
3490,The Bonham Hotel,"The Bonham hotel is beautiful. Our room was very spacious and elaborately decorated. We fully appreciated the room being stocked with water as we spent our days walking around the city. The staff was kind and helpful, and we enjoyed our breakfast in the mornings. The common areas are very beautiful and comfortable to be in, particularly the library. The only downside was the bed - it was not at all comfortable and very stiff. We slept okay because we walked 8-10 miles while we were there and were just extremely tired."
3491,The Bonham Hotel,"Fantastic stay in this beautiful decorated hotel.Spotlessly clean with all you need and more in your room.Room was very spacious with a fantastic views.Staff were very friendly and helpful from booking, checking in-out, serving us afternoon tea, breakfast and bar staff. Afternoon tea was delicious with lots to eat.Breakfast was fantastic and set us for the day..Certainly will return"
3492,The Bonham Hotel,"I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Bonham it's a fantastic place to stay in Edinburgh, great location just five minutes walk to Princess Street, staff were super friendly. Lovely breakfast and fantastic rooms, what more could you ask for!"
3493,The Bonham Hotel,Hotel was beautiful and spotless. Staff very friendly and promptly fulfilled all special requests. Attended afternoon tea which was delicious. Getting a night cap in the hotel bar each night was great - warm and welcoming.
3494,The Bonham Hotel,"Warm, elegant, inviting hotel made up of several attached Georgian townhomes. The location is in ""New Town"" which is actually a few centuries old and convenient to the ""old Town as well. Friendly and accommodating staff. Overall helped to make our stay very memorable."
3495,The Bonham Hotel,"We have been visiting the Bonham for circa 15 years and have seen many changes and refurbishments. The hotels has the best layout and the grandest decoration yet. The staff are friendly, courteous and efficient. Did not eat in the restaurant (closed Sunday and Monday night) but the breakfast was excellent."
3496,The Bonham Hotel,We have stayed at this hotel several times over the last 15 years. It has changed ownership and all I can say is how well it has been redecorated and kept the ambiance of the beautiful building. Service good and staff professional but friendly and approachable. We will definitely be staying at this hotel again on our next visit to the beautiful city of Edinburgh.
3497,The Bonham Hotel,"Amazing hotel in the West End, staff superb, luxurious surroundings and the food is excellent in the No 35. We were on the top floor with amazing views across the West of Edinburgh and even saw the Northern Lights!! Loved our 2 night stay and thoroughly recommend it. Thankyou"
3498,The Bonham Hotel,We stayed for three nights and had a fantastic time. We were well looked after and made to feel really welcome. Great breakfast and a nice bar. Easy access to west of the city and new town. Stroll along George Street for food and shopping then return via Rose Street for a few drinks.
3499,The Bonham Hotel,"From start to finish this hotel is a class act. Great location in the very nice west-end, just a few minutes walk from the end of Princes St. The hotel itself is a wonderful blend of victorian old world charm, think oak panelling, fused with all the modern amenities of a 21st century 5* establishment. We had room 103, a first floor, superior king overlooking the gardens outside the front of the hotel. The quality of the fixtures and fittings was exceedingly good. Huge height ceilings and plush bedding. The in-room facilities included safe, iron (and board), branded umbrella, and fridge with complimentary water. The bathroom was equally as high standard. We stayed one night and had breakfast, which was superb. Great quality produce, served and presented by impeccably smart,…"
3500,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,We have stayed here on a few occasions now and we’re never disappointed. Great accommodation with excellent food and helpful staff. If you want to book a treatment in the spa do this as soon as you book as it’s always busy.
3501,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,Inside and outside looked amazing the hotel has spa facilities a bar and restaurant. Check in and check out was easy and the staff are always on hand should you need them. The staff are pleasant and friendly and the rooms are absolutely amazing.
3502,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Nobody reads 3 star reviews so rated it at one star for room 71. Nice clean, well appointed room and bathroom with 4 star quality. Only gets one star as there is an air conditioning unit at floor level outside, under the window supplying another suite. This unit pulsates through the room keeping you awake all night. Ate in Nelsons bar which served good food, but the maitre d and waitress didn't seem happy at their work. Efficient, but hardly service with a smile."
3503,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,It was me and my wife's 25th anniversary my wife loved the spa had a meal in the nelsons bar absolutely amazing and e special mention to the waiter and waitress and all the team very friendly and professional all a credit to the hotel the room that we stayed in was really nice thank you the Grosvener for special day cannot wait to come back👍
3504,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Beginning of June we booked a room for the night to celebrate our 1st Anniversary at the hotel. In all fairness reservations who took our booking were fantastic as we explained having stayed for a night for a wedding in March we didnt want one of their spiral staircase bedrooms as we felt if you had a case and wanted it in the bedroom it was a health and safety issue getting it up and down the stairs. On the day we decided to enjoy lunch in the pub bar and relax before we booked in for the night. The meal was lovely but the service was slow and we almost felt we had an invisibility cloak on as two or three times we had to catch the waitress eye before we got served (after a wait of 10 to 15 mins between courses) On getting into the room, the bedroom area itself was nice but…"
3505,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying for 3 nights this week and we had a great time. The staff were all very friendly and professional, from the moment we checked in to checking out. The room we stayed in was clean and well equipped, slight minor criticism would be the bathroom could have done with some hooks somewhere to hang clothes or dressing gown. We ate in both the Nelson and Palm restaurant and both the food and service were excellent. The breakfast is also very nice, it’s set up as a self service. It has a good variety and the staff are on hand for any requests that aren’t available. Also they were helpful with vegan/dairy free options. The palm restaurant in particular is lovely, whoever designed it has done a tremendous job, and also the pianist during…"
3506,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"This was our second visit to the hotel & I just want to say a wonderful thank you to all who went out of their way to accommodate myself and my husband after having a terrible experience with another hotel. We arrived around 10pm in Thursday night & although the food had finished service we were looked after. From the very first impressions of the hotel I guarantee you will not be disappointed. The staff are second to none & obviously take great pride in their jobs. The rooms are immaculate as are the Nelson bar, Palm Court & Spa. Everything has been thoroughly thought about with lovely attention to detail everywhere you look. Unfortunately our stay this time was brief due to a severe mess up elsewhere but we will certainly be returning & wouldn't consider booking anywhere…"
3507,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We stayed here as a family of 4. Couldn’t fault the hotel. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and very spacious. The pool area was lovely and the grounds were very nice! I would most definitely stay here again!"
3508,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"This stay was for our beautiful wedding, we had the opportunity to make use of the Bank Holiday to hold our wedding day & benefit our guests to a lovely ceremony & venue all under one place with such amazing character and a wonderful presentation of the Hotel Our only main issue was the room booking and front desk services which I heard many disgruntled comments being made regards the booking room service including Check in & Check out process"
3509,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Lunch at Nelsons Bar, at the hotel. Long wait for service, though pleasant waiter. Awful meal. The chicken was over cooked and tasteless. The chips were pale coloured and limp. The salad on the plate was minimal. We shall not be returning for a second helping."
3510,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,Reception staff were very unhelpful on arrival no robes provided for use of spa not good value for money at all. Despite this we had a lovely stay and would stay again but wouldn’t pay as much for a room that was average at best
3511,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Mix up with rooms, they had me as booking an Executive Room instead of a Deluxe - rooms offered were quite tired looking and bed wasn't very comfortable unfortunately. Slept one night in a Superior room but this was like sleeping on a concrete base - booked for 3 nights and wanted to come home after the first night :-("
3512,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"The property is one of the loveliest we have encountered on this trip to the UK. However it began on a very sour, unexpected and uncalled for note of unwelcome from the receptionist we came to identify as Hayley. She was on the plus one side of being rude and curt towards my husband checking us in, citing “the information is in the room” to 3 of his questions regarding the spa, breakfast and check out. How inconsiderate of us to bother her? Not withstanding (both my husband and I are 5star property hoteliers in Asia/Pacific) the hotel is exquisite in its interiors, facilities and sense of “arrival” for all guests there. Mr/Mrs Nelson, you should be extremely proud of this rare and precious gem you lovingly share with Cheshire. The pool and spa areas were of a surprisingly high…"
3513,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,A lovely stay in a very beautiful hotel with fabulous grounds. The room was extremely comfortable and the bathroom amazing! The evening meal in palm court was delicious! We will definitely be returning very soon.
3514,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We stayed here for 1 night during the week in May and it was very nice! We stayed dinner, bed and breakfast on the back of a Red Letter Days package. The interior is well done out and the staff are friendly! We were in a Deluxe Double Room which was one of the funkiest rooms I’ve stayed in as you walked in and had your own set of stairs to your bed in the loft area. We dined at the Palm Court restaurant which the food was to a high standard and they had a self playing piano which created a lovely ambiance! We had a £30pp food allowance which wasn’t confirmed until we got the bill but this is the standard for most places so we weren’t fussed about paying the extra but some people did complain about this it wasn’t made clear. Breakfast was served in the same place the next morning…"
3515,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We decided to book the Spring break,offer and stayed Sunday overnight. The offer is dinner, bed and. Breakfast. We were delighted with the service, food and general ambience of the Hotel. We were surprised at the quality of the room, and the huge king sized bed was so comfortable, and slept like babies! We booked for Sunday lunch and went to the car very in the restful Palm Court. It was lovely, and not disappointing at all, in fact the food was not only delicious, but I think would sate even the most hungry appetite. Breakfast was a little disappointing, but early arrival is better, we slept late so, although the food was still good, missed the best. Still no complaints, we left rested and happy, and plan to visit again to stay. The staff were very friendly and went the…"
3516,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"The hotel room was gorgeous, so was the food. Only issue we had was this was a pre paid gift including afternoon tea, evening meal and overnight stay and at each point we were asked to pay again (even though I had provided the gift card) it felt extremely unorganised and was such a pain. They told us we had to pay as they had no payment details even though I had given the voucher 4 times."
3517,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,We were really impressed with the Grosvenor Pulford having lived in Rossett for 20 years until 2010. It was only a pub then. Magnificent decor of our room and hotel facilities. The service was very good from reception to the dining area. We will return for our 57th wedding anniversary.
3518,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Spring one night break with evening meal allowance and breakfast was very good value for money early in the week. The Hotel and grounds are superb. The SPA are is first class with beautiful Japanese styled gardens outside. It is delightful to dine in the Palm Court restaurant and the food is so flavoursome and delicious. There is plenty of choice at breakfast in the same setting, all freshly presented. The staff are also very friendly and efficient which makes your stay even more enjoyable. In summary - a fabulous hotel !"
3519,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We had an executive room, which was pretty big and very comfortable. We booked dinner, B&B, and although Palm Court only offers Carvery on a Sunday, we were not disappointed! The food was excellent and the service was brilliant. We took full advantage of the leisure facilities, and my only comment would be that the changing rooms need updating. It was also busy in the morning, but that’s to be expected. Changing rooms were not a major issue because we paid for an upgrade to robes and slippers, so we got changed back in our room. Would highly recommend this hotel, and will define be returning."
3520,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,We have been coming here for years now long before the refurbishment.The grounds are very beautiful a totally relaxing break .This time we brought two of our daughters who both loved the hotel too .Our first time on the ground floor and the room was still very nice .I love the fact the hotel is dog friendly too
3521,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We had an overnight stay here, we met with friends who had stayed here before. Everything was amazing. Our room had a spiral staircase leading to the bedroom and bathroom. The room and the view over the gardens were spectacular. We had evening meal and breakfast in the Palm Court restaurant, both were excellent. The hotel is stunning and the staff are really friendly. We thourouly enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back."
3522,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,Wonderful hotel accommodation was well worth the extra money exceptional. The food in the restaurant was 1st class and the servers did an excellent job. I would just like to add 1 comment there was no one to help take our luggage to our room.We will return
3523,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Room very clean, staff lovely, surroundings peaceful and pretty. My only issue would be the place needs a shop, but it's not essential to the enjoyment of the stay. Great value for money, wonderful choice of food and beautiful surroundings, the chandelier in the lobby is fabulous."
3524,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Fabulous hotel, bar and function room. My friend’s wedding was a great day, supported by really friendly and supportive staff from The Grosvenor. Beautiful hotel and lovely rooms. The food was lovely in the bar and restaurant and the gardens are really spectacular surroundings."
3525,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Decided to stay on the spur of the moment Booked via the website and offers…”Sparkling “Stay Excellent value for money…Food allowance, Bottle of Prosecco and Chocolates in the room and pool/ spa access. For less than the lowest room and breakfast rate! Room excellent and the whole hotel is very well maintained. The Hotel is very well maintained and service and staff are all very professional Many a hotel should visit the GP to see how to run a hotel! Congratulations to the owners, management and staff…it is the little touches that make the hotel special. Originally visited hotel as daughters wedding and now visited several times Will visit again……"
3526,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,1 night stay with Spa break. Room was lovely however WiFi quality was poor and kept dropping out continually also smoke detector above bed flashed continuously all night. On checking out we were not asked whether we enjoyed our stay which I thought was strange as this is usually a question that is asked.
3527,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We stayed here for a wedding, the hotel, the wedding and staff were all great. The room was good and clean and we was looking forward to spending our time there. The problems came when we went to bed, with the window cracked open the aircon machines outside our window where humming all night, then from 6am the noise from above woke us. At first I thought it was just somebody above us getting up and leaving but it was constant! I couldn’t phone down to reception because the phone in the room didn’t work, I went out and asked a very nice lady from house keeping what the noise above was. She said that house keep was above our room and they had just started work at 8am. The noise has been constant from 6am and sounded like furniture was being moved. We gave up and went to check…"
3528,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Was amazing from start to finish would definitely recommend. I visited with friends but will definitely b going back again with my husband, palm court for breakfast was amazing. We had lunch in the Nelson bar which also would highly recommend. We went into Chester for tea but really didn’t have to leave hotel everything is there under one roof"
3529,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We were on a short break and really enjoyed our stay at the Grosvenor. The room was excellent and the staff unfailingly polite, cheerful and helpful. The room was modern, spotlessly clean and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone having a short break in the Chester/North Wales area."
3530,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,We have just returned from lovely spa break.(treated by our daughter)We were greeted by a really helpful guy on reception called Ben. We were upgraded to a suite as a special treat which was amazing room 75. We had lunch in Nelson’s bar and Dinner in the Palm court restaurant. Food in both was very good( special thanks to the manager at the Palm Court and his lovely wife Rose) . Breakfast was really good with excellent service. We spent the morning in the spa and the pool and had a lovely time. The venue is beautiful and will definitely return soon. Thank you
3531,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,An excellent find. Beautiful grounds and the hotel is very tastefully decorated. Room was clean and comfortable. Food was excellent. My preference would be to have a freshly cooked breakfast rather than self service buffet.
3532,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"This was a gift from our daughter would recommend. Palm Court was excellent for our evening meal and the room was excellent. I did book 2 treatments from the Kasia spa the only thing was one was cancelled due to me not paying for the treatments, however on the web page this wasn’t showing as an option and I was sent two confirmation emails to say all was booked, but there is a policy that bookings can be cancelled if not paid in front! webpage may need looking at. This however did not spoil the stay and was rectified on the day but maybe something to think about when booking treatments."
3533,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Stayed for a 2 night break, really lovely service and the room was excellent. We had to change our dates at short notice due to a family funeral, and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating and kind about it. We ate in the Palm Court restaurant the first night which was outstanding, really delicious and beautifully presented food, excellent service and there was a live piano player and singer the night we were there which created a lovely atmosphere without being intrusive. Ate in Nelson's bar the second night where the food was also delicious and service really good, but a bit more of a relaxed atmosphere. It was nice to do both. We also really enjoyed the pool which was clean and well-maintained, a really good size, and not too busy, though it is a bit of a maze of…"
3534,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Hotel and grounds were beautiful, rooms were clean, comfortable and dog friendly. Staff were all polite, friendly and efficient. Very enjoyable stay. Afternoon tea in the Palm Court restaurant was most enjoyable with live piano music and a comfortable setting."
3535,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff are very helpful, from the booking process, to the warm welcome on arrival, including the staff at the restaurant and spa. The delux room was clean, comfortable and spacious. I pre-booked a meal at the Palm Court and a Spa treatment before arrival. The atmosphere in the Palm Court is wonderful and the food was delicious - definitely worth a visit. I didn't have time to enjoy the spa facilities but the spa treatment I did receive was worth the price. There is plenty of on site parking."
3536,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Once again an excellent stay at the Grosvenor. All staff as always, were very efficient as well as being friendly and helpful. Food and service was excellent and tasted as good as it looked. Well done once again to you all!!"
3537,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,The hotel is one of the best we have stayed in. From the amazing staff including Victoria on reception plus Joao and Aaron in the restaurant (to name a few) nothing was too much trouble. Our room was superb and if you’re taking your dog you couldn’t ask for a better hotel and gardens.
3538,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"We chose to stay her after our wedding day and the day after, we made full use of the spa and restaurant and really enjoyed our stay. Only minor complaint is the room was always too hot even with Aircon on lowest setting."
3539,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Fab hotel , lovely staff, well recommended.Would definitely come back . Couldn’t fault anything.Food lovely and cleanliness 10 out of 10. We were lucky enough to have a room overlooking the koi carp ."
3540,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"If you stay on Sunday night you can benefit from a great offer, take a look on the website. Fish and Chips in the bar were plentiful and well cooked. Lovely room which was upgraded, thank you. The breakfast is top quality and can’t be faulted. We will be back again. Thank you."
3541,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Busy wedding venue with on site spa. Room very nice, one of rare ones that overlooked gardens. Others in our group had no view. Lighting in room difficult to operate. No hooks in bathroom. Noise from next door bathroom graphic. Evening food excellent quality and service spot on. Breakfast more hit and miss, many listed menu items missing.. coffee very slow to arrive and not pleasant."
3542,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Only away for 2 days but had an amazing experience from start to finish. The room, spa, restaurant, location & especially the staff were fantastic too. Everywhere was clean & all the little touches made a big difference. Definitely stay again."
3543,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Excellent service, throughout the hotel, the staff could not do enough to help, including last minute changes. Great facilities, lovely clean pool and spa area. The whole hotel is a great place. Thank you for a great weekend"
3544,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Only used to stay the night after a trip up mount snowdon, check in was very quick. Room was perfect. Bath room was lovely. Overall area and building was very nice. Late check out (11am) and early check in (2pm) was perfect compared to most hotels. Only negative I took from the stay was I couldn't leave the AC on when sleeping as after 15mins it started to make a noise as if water was running or a tap was running."
3545,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,I booked this break for my husbands birthday. We had booked one of the executive rooms with staircase however the drains smelt so we were moved. Unfortunately the new room was not as nice as our first room 🥹
3546,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Beautiful Hotel, Very friendly and polite staff, The food in Palm court was exceptional. The room we had was really spacious, very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend and stay here again"
3547,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,"Booked one night in hotel and they put us on the ground floor. Room was completely different to what was shown on booking.com and was dated . No internet connection on ground floor or any phone signal. I went to reception to which I was simply told ‘you will have to just talk to each other’ which was funny but for what your paying for that’s what should be included. Apart from that, food in hotel is lovely as well as spa."
3548,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,We found this gem of a hotel at a steal of a price and couldn’t resist We only stayed one night but thoroughly enjoyed our stay and couldn’t fault it one bit it was amazing food drink spa bed staff all 10/10 Thankyou all
3549,Grosvenor Pulford Hotel & Spa,We enjoyed a fabulously relaxing break at the Pulford with family. Every aspect of our stay was excellent. We particularly enjoyed our swim and dinner in the palm restaurant listening to the live music. Will definitely visit again soon.
3550,The Castle Hotel,"Not our first stay at the Castle but probably our last. The hotel is very popular with dog owners as it is pet friendly, great for dog lovers but not so for anyone who is not. Never seen so many dogs, really put us off staying there. Our room was lovely but some areas needed a good dust and clean. Such a pity, would no longer recommend this hotel."
3551,The Castle Hotel,Very convenient central location. Can leave the car in the hotel car park and walk all round Conwy easily. Less than 5 minutes from the quay to sit and watch the world go by - what could be better? Back again in September!
3552,The Castle Hotel,"The Good; (yes there was somne!0 Handy town centre parking. The room was clean & tidy. The staff were friendly & attentive. The bad; All rooms are on the first & second floor. There's is no lift or means of assistance to get upstairs if you have mobility issues. The room overlooked the bins and a construction site.(which started at 7:30am) The bar was scruffy and cramped with a need of a revamp. The restaurant was outdated, dark and in need of a lick of paint. The menu was just plain odd - with ingredients that should never be seen together on the same plate. My wife had fish n chips served on imitation news print that went soggy and ended up mixing with the food! The soup starter was ok but the bread rolls were too small & soggy - small details but they matter. The wine is…"
3553,The Castle Hotel,Very good hotel and staff. Good rear and front car parking. Lovely bar and dining room. Nice outside courtyard/beer garden to rear of back entrance. Great toiletries and tea/coffee supplies with Espresso machine.
3554,The Castle Hotel,"The staff were very helpful and attentive which added to our stay. Parking was convenient across the road from the hotel. The room was very clean and well serviced by the staff. The only downside to the room was that it was at the front overlooking the street so there was some noise early morning due to dustbin collections, street cleaner and deliveries. The ambiance of the hotel was very pleasant which enhanced our stay. An interesting feature was the stained glass panel at the entrance to the dining room made by Drew Pritchard. It was interesting that there were booklets placed around the hotel detailing the history of the building and features around the area. All added to an enjoyable visit."
3555,The Castle Hotel,"We had a wonderful 3 night break at your beautiful hotel. The hotel was cosy and full of character and the staff friendly and efficient. Our room was spacious clean and lots of lovely extras, i.e. chocolate and 'proper' coffee. Robes and slippers and plenty of towels. The evening meal was delicious and very generous portions. The only slight negative was the breakfast, would have liked to have had a greater choice of hot food, i.e. porridge, kippers, scrambled eggs and salmon, but again was plentiful. Thankyou for a lovely stay. Will definitely be visiting again."
3556,The Castle Hotel,"Beautiful, history steeped, individual and quirky building hosted our most wonderful wedding reception. From the onset of planning to the final touches, Toni, Danny and their staff could not have been more helpful or accommodating. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and the chef even consented to re-creating a dish from the previous seasons menu for one guest.The food provided was excellent, with many compliments on the menu. The suite we occupied was lavish, gorgeously decorated and unique. Our guests also spoke highly of their rooms. We dined in The Lavin Room and when I entered to have a sneak peek before the guests arrived, I was moved to tears, it looked beautiful. Danny corresponded with my Brother-in-law to provide the most delectable wines, and risked muscle and…"
3557,The Castle Hotel,"We stayed one night for a relatives wedding. Our Junior Suite was stylish and comfortable and the bride & grooms Deluxe Suite was amazing. All the guests staying for the wedding were allowed early check in to get ready which was very much appreciated. Another huge advantage was how dog friendly the hotel is. Three dogs attended the wedding service, reception and stayed in the Hotel. We were allocated a private room for post ceremony champagne and breakfast the next day. The Lavin room which can seat up to 20 guests was perfect for the wedding breakfast and the food was extremely well presented and tasted delicious. The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful and really helped make the whole event very special. I would highly recommend to anyone in the area looking for…"
3558,The Castle Hotel,"The hotel staff was very friendly from check-in to check-out. The hotel is a wonderful piece of history with beautifl rooms, comfortable beds and pillows. The food in the dinning room was lovely. After we left the country we realized we left are jackets there and called the hotel. They then boxed them up and shipped them to us. Not many hotels have staff like that."
3559,The Castle Hotel,"The hotel is certainly historic and a few years ago may have been good, but sadly the food was poor, waiting staff inexperienced and cleanliness of bathroom in particular left a lot to be desired (see photos). I fully appreciate that an old building needs to be looked after with care but windows can still be gently cleaned internally."
3560,The Castle Hotel,"Our first time in Wales and we certainly struck gold! Staff were excellent, friendly, nothing too much trouble. Junior Suite bedroom was very comfortable and we loved the decor and facilities provided."
3561,The Castle Hotel,Had a wonderful stay at the Castle Hotel. Whole experience from beginning to end was fantastic. Had a trip in November postponed due to family illness. The team had been so wonderful we committed to returning. Thanks to Assistant Manager Danny and the team. You made our trip wonderful and so memorable. Shout out to Danny for being above and beyond.
3562,The Castle Hotel,We stayed at the Castle Hotel for a week and had an extremely pleasant stay. The food was fantastic and the staff were extremely accommodating. The few minor issues we had with our room were resolved straight away. The room was well presented and overall good value for money. I would highly recommend the castle hotel to anyone looking to stay in Conwy. A special thanks to Will who is a real credit to the front of house staff.
3563,The Castle Hotel,"Lovely 2 night stay in beautiful Conwy. Perfectly located hotel on the High Street, so easy walking to shops, restaurants, castle and city walls. Staff were very obliging offering a free room upgrade due to my partners height and a double bed being too short. Breakfast was plentiful and dinner menu was varied enough for non meat eaters. Good value and moreso with our TripAdvisor offer. Only downside was the early morning wake up call from the glass and waste collection vehicles. Didnt detract from a lovely break though! Thankyou to all the staff for your hard work and great service!"
3564,The Castle Hotel,We were only there one night and we were so sad to have to leave so quickly! Beautiful room with stunning decor and a perfect view of the castle. Fantastic dinner in the restaurant. We would come back to stay or dine anytime!
3565,The Castle Hotel,After reading the good reviews! Our experience was abit different our room was very dirty the clean bedding was marked the bath had a lot of shaved hair in it which I cleaned we were only there one night break from work so just got on with it we didn’t want to make a fuss so just ignored! On a positive side the staff were good in the restaurant really friendly and helpful
3566,The Castle Hotel,"My wife and I had visited Conwy before but only on a day trip. This two day break at the Castle Hotel was even better than expected although, after reading reviews, our expectations were high. The suite was luxurious and very comfortable with a good view over the town. The only occasion that we heard any noise was the pleasant notification of the time by the nearby church. Dinner was excellent to the point that my wife claimed that it was the ""... best meal ever."" - and we try to eat out at least twice a month at selected restaurants. Breakfast - especially the 'Full Welsh Breakfast' was superb on the first morning and the bacon sandwich on the second morning - hit the spot perfectly. The hotel is centrally placed for an easy walk around the town and proximate to Conwy Castle…"
3567,The Castle Hotel,"We arrived at the hotel earlier than check in time. The parking was excellent, free and loads of spaces. Check in was quick and friendly and our room was ready so that was great. There are no lifts and all rooms are upstairs. I was pleased with our room , it was comfortable. We had a coffee machine, kettle with complementary tea, coffee and hot chocolate. They do leave ear plugs for you and now I understand why. Very noisy being on the front of the hotel. We got woken up regularly and around 5am could hear workers outside. There is a nice bar and the prices are very reasonable for drinks. It closes to the public at 11pm but there is a night porter so you can still be served. Breakfast was lovely and staff very helpful and friendly. Location is perfect for all amenities. We did…"
3568,The Castle Hotel,"A beautiful hotel with very pleasent staff. Room incredibly comfortable and a fantastic view of the castle, espically of an evening. Only very slight issue was the restaurant which was very busy (which is understandable as the food was great), however, not enough staff on to cover the main restaurant and the dining area of the bar so service was a little slow and never received the desert menu. Parking was a bonus, although was a bit of a nightmare finding a space upon arrival, as non-residents whom were dining were also using the car park - maybe some parking should be reserved/allocated for staying residents."
3569,The Castle Hotel,"The hotel was good, but disappointed that there was no lounge areas to relax for guests. It is geared up for dining and is open to members of the public. It seems to be one of the very few central hotels in Conway."
3570,The Castle Hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel! It has recently undergone a complete refurbishment and is filled with interesting, tasteful artefacts around every corner. Situated right in the centre of this glorious Welsh town, it has a private car park, plus a nice outdoor seating area, for drinks, bar meals and smokers. The food is sensational. Compliments to the chef. Our German friends loved it."
3571,The Castle Hotel,"Very nice bedroom with lovely extras. Especially Tea Pigs tea bags, chocolate, toiletries and Netflix. We ordered lunch on arrival which was nice when it eventually arrived after a very long wait. We appeared to have been forgotten despite sitting right. Y the kitchen entrance. The gentleman on duty offered free puddings or drinks to smooth things which was very much appreciated. At breakfast we were seated. Then waited to order while orders were taken around us from others who had come in after us. In the end I had to ask if we could order. We had the full Welsh breakfast which was good ……. apart from the tomato. Which oddly was a cooked whole tomato which did not look pleasant and was very hard. Overall a nice hotel but we were left feeling a little disappointed for…"
3572,The Castle Hotel,"We booked this one night stay on a Black Friday deal, which we have done for quite a number of years now. We stayed in the one of the Suites (Room 301). It was absolutely gorgeous. The breakfast was very good, as usual. Can't wait to return."
3573,The Castle Hotel,"Arrived and the car park was full, but a space was found within 15 minutes. Check in was efficient. The evening meal was very good, Kieran was excellent, breakfast was good with high quality ingredients and their own muesli. The room was well appointed, but as an old building it did not have air conditioning and so we kept the window open but there was a lot of noise from seagulls and pigeons."
3574,The Castle Hotel,"We stayed in one of the Deluxe Suites, Room 301, a really beautiful room at the top of the hotel (note this means 3 flights of stairs!). Dinner and breakfast was great as was the service. The hotel is in the centre of Conwy and close to everything, which is really handy but there can be a bit of noise from the streets around. I would recommend walking the town walls, visiting the nearby rspb reserve and, on a good weather day, a trip to Portmerion."
3575,The Castle Hotel,"What a fantastic place, very comfortable, clean, and a great atmosphere. Staff are great, friendly and very professional. We only had a single night as was a flying visit, but felt very welcomed and looked after. Will definitely come back for a longer stay."
3576,The Castle Hotel,"We Stayed for 2 nights choosing to eat in the hotel for the first night. Easy to locate in the centre of Conwy with free parking both at the back and opposite the Hotel. We stayed in a room overlooking the rear of the hotel which was lovely and quiet. Our room was very well decorated and had everything we needed, perhaps the addition of some bottled water to compliment the tea and coffee? All in all an excellent and enjoyable stay and we will definitely returning."
3577,The Castle Hotel,A lovely characterful hotel. Nice ambience in the bar and restaurant. Perfect location with the bonus of a carpark. The hotel is an old coaching inn but with some subtle modern twists. We had a lovely stay
3578,The Castle Hotel,"Fantastic time, rooms, staff and food was all excellent. We are so impressed that we are looking to book another stay later on in the year. Everything was clean, spotless. The evening meal and breakfast were delicious. The staff were all friendly and helpful. Thank you."
3579,The Castle Hotel,"Can’t recommend this hotel enough, we stayed for two nights in a lovely room at the front of the hotel looking straight onto the street, which I loved. The breakfast was lovely with homemade muesli and fresh cooked welsh breakfast. Dinner in the evening was a fantastic choice on the menu but it needs veggies options, they have lots of vegan but my partner likes butter and cheese but that’s it really, oh and I had the best lamb I have ever eaten. Thanks again for a lovely stay."
3580,The Castle Hotel,We loved the Castle hotel. We visited during Christmas which is a perfect time to go. This is a great place to do sightseeing in northern Wales. We never had our luggage during our visit due to a screwup by British Airways. Six weeks later the hotel received some of our luggage. The staff were so awesome and kind and helped us get our luggage back. They were so kind and represents how great the Welsh are. We had so many great experiences.
3581,The Castle Hotel,Friends booked the hotel for us and themselves and we had a fabulous stay. The staff were warm and friendly. My wife and I have both said we would definitely stay here again. There was one issue with the bedside light not working and we told reception and this was fixed as promised the following day.
3582,The Castle Hotel,"Extremely impressed with this hotel. The rooms are superb, the beds are very comfortable, the food in the restaurant is delicious and the service is friendly and helpful (especially in happily getting my cases to my room given my general decrepitude!)"
3583,The Castle Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel a couple of times before some years ago and decided to return. Everything was so relaxed and so easy from booking in to leaving. Great nights sleep in a very cosy bed with all needs catered for. All toiletries were provided and really good quality. As it was my wife's birthday we decided to eat the first night at the hotel, the Sunday Roast was fantastic. (could have licked the plate) Next night was not as good, both had the fish and chips and while nice, the batter was a bit dry and crispy. Other than that no faults at all. We didnt have our dog with us but it was great to see everybody else's dog in the bar. Made some good friends. Highly recommend this hotel"
3584,The Castle Hotel,"Staff require better training, Breakfast, cold toast both mornings, Luke warm coffee both mornings. Evening meal, hot desert brought in chilled bowl for two people. Asked for coffee in the bar after meal at 9.30pm and the reply was, not sure if the coffee machine is still on. Asked for a glass of port, sorry no port. Overall, food was good and staff pleasant."
3585,The Castle Hotel,"We stayed for one night in an executive suite and had a great time. The room was on the 3rd floor, quiet, clean and large with a separate seating area. This was a real highlight with seats overlooking the castle, a perfect place for a morning brew! The bed was large and comfortable and the bathroom was super clean with a lovely roll top bath. The only thing we found difficult was parking as both hotel car parks were full and the others recommended on their website meant a walk with suitcases and paying to park. We would definitely stay again."
3586,The Castle Hotel,"We had noticed this hotel before when passing through Conwy so when an offer came up on Travelzoo we booked it immediately. Our room was clean , comfortable and warm. The bathroom looked as though it had gone through a recent refurbishment and it was lovely. Breakfast was outstanding and we had a delicious meal also in the restaurant. We will return."
3587,The Castle Hotel,"Room was filthy. Dust everywhere, toothpaste spit in the bathroom. Hairs and coffee stains in the drawer in bathroom. Overall really quite dirty. Yuk. This isn’t something I look for in hotels, it was so glaringly obvious I just couldn’t believe it."
3588,The Castle Hotel,"Our visit to The Castle was courtesy of our daughter and her husband, and what a lovely gift it was. The hotel is warm, welcoming and very comfortable, the staff are relaxed and informed, the building is glorious, and we loved everything. Can definitely see us returning."
3589,The Castle Hotel,"The Castle Hotel is well located in the centre of Conwy. Our room was big clean and comfortable. Breakfast is freshly cooked to order with good service. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the receptionist We will definitely stay here again"
3590,The Castle Hotel,"Myself, my husband and our 6 month old visited Conwy and stayed at The Castle Hotel for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! We booked a deluxe double which was plenty big enough, with a very comfortable bed - the only shame was no mini fridge as we had baby bottles (the receptionist was kind enough to offer a fridge in the reception but it wasn’t the most convenient for us, so nothing bad to say here!). The room had tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc, as well as a little seating area at the other end of the room. All the staff were very friendly and the hotel had a great charm about it. We also ate in the restaurant on the first night, menu was great and food was lovely - we ate early due to the baby so it was quiet, but also saw it buzzing and busy on other occasions! …"
3591,The Castle Hotel,"A very quick visit to Conwy but we were so pleased to have found The Castle Hotel! The staff were simply amazing - welcoming, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The food was excellent and while the building is a little tired in places and in need of some repair, it was all cosmetic and no doubt a never-ending and costly job for a property of this age. Super dog-friendly too..... we will be back!"
3592,The Castle Hotel,Enjoyed our break. Conwy town interesting with history. Good local coffee shops and pubs. We had room overlooking car park but understand should have asked for room overlooking street at front so have learnt for next time. Also enjoyed nearby Anglesey and Bodnant Garden.
3593,The Castle Hotel,"We really enjoyed our night away. I had read some recent reviews with trepidation. We were in room 110, a twin. We had 2 double beds that were very comfortable, our room was immaculately clean. Food fabulous"
3594,The Castle Hotel,"Only drawback is that there is no lift and if you are on the second floor, it requires some stamina with a suitcase. Other than that, I would recommend a stay to explore Conwy and the surrounding area."
3595,The Castle Hotel,"Enjoyed our first night in a standard room, which had only been booked 3 days beforehand. However, the Suite on the 2nd floor had been booked well in advance for my wife's birthday and all I can say is - fantastic. The staff were friendly, courteous and nothing was too much trouble."
3596,The Castle Hotel,Very comfortable hotel with good food and service.The level of cleanliness in the bedroom was of concern - thick dust on many pieces of furniture Smell of damp in the bathroom I did not feel clean in the room and this spoiled the stay to some extent
3597,The Castle Hotel,"We have stayed at The castle Hotel twice previously (once being in the executive room) and always enjoyed our experience, however our stay this Friday 24 February was somewhat different. Our greeting on arrival was excellent and your reception staff were great. Upon arriving in the room you gave us and we appreciate we paid £130.00 for 1 night in a standard room we felt disappointed. The room was dirty and a lot of dust in every area throughout, even coffee splashes up the wall next to the bedside table on the left. We decided to overlook this at the time and carried on with our afternoon as we knew you were already booked to full capacity and would therefore not expect to be able to change rooms. When we arrived back at the room later in the evening around 21.30 the heat was…"
3598,The Castle Hotel,We stayed at the castle for 3 nights midweek. The hotel was right in the town center which was perfect for all amenities. Our suite was fantastic great view of castle. Lovely staff. Food fantastic a great stay
3599,The Castle Hotel,"Lovely hotel, our room 104 needs a new mattress, had the worst two nights sleep ever and very hot in the rooom, could not wait to go home to a nice bed. Food and breakfast both excellent, and set in a top location."
3600,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We booked the restaurant but chose to eat in the garden as it was such a lovely summer evening. The service was attentive and knowledgable about the dishes. The sommelier was extremely informative. We couldn’t help listening to all the detailed advice he was giving other customers about matching the wine to the food. We couldn’t fault any dish we had, superb. Celeriac soup, beef tartare, ribeye steak with charred hispi cabbage, lamb with carrot escabeche, sheep yoghurt, bitter leaf and rhubarb with piqual olive oil, vanilla for desert. We’ll be back."
3601,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"super nice experience. It was our firs time in Bath, and the Royal Crescent is the best place to stay. we loved it! The hotel is amazing , the gardens even more. The staff is absolutely charming. It is a big YES"
3602,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"This is a gorgeous hotel situated in the middle of the famous and historic Royal Crescent. Our room was moderate in size but well-appointed, and the amenities were what one would expect from a hotel of this caliber. We had breakfast and lunch here, and both were excellent; we were able to dine outside on both occasions, with very little waiting. The service was top-notch as well, and the location is simply unbeatable. We’ll certainly return here."
3603,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We had booked the spa package which included a 1 hour facial and the use of the spa for 1 hr. This was wonderful , the best facial I’ve ever had with the products from ‘Templespa’. Also my daughter and I had the Spa all to ourselves which was a huge bonus. After going to the spa we then had to go for our lunch with was next door. Unfortunately this wasn’t very good. We waited so long for each course to come that in the end I had to try and find a member of staff to ask how long it was going to be. This wasn’t easy as no member of staff came near us and seemed to be in the other area of the Restuarant. I did eventually tell a waiter who then after seeing my disappointment of waiting so long offered a glass of bubbles which was very much appreciated. My starter came and I enjoyed…"
3604,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"From start to finish the weekend with our family (adult sons + a girlfriend) was absolutely idyllic. We had rooms in the same section of the hotel which made organisation easier, ours overlooked the lawns, used the spa and beautiful pool, and generally wallowed in the luxurious atmosphere. Perfect time with perfect, warm and thoughtful service."
3605,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Our first visit to Bath and toThe Royal Crescent Hotel. We arrived early to find our room ready and we had also unexpectedly been upgraded to a lovely spacious deluxe Suite. The bed was very comfortable, the suite was perfectly furnished and exceptionally clean. At all times we were welcomed by friendly, knowledgeable staff who were eager to make us feel comfortable and catered for. The afternoon tea in the lovely outdoor setting was just perfect. We had the spa an pool to ourselves in the evening and felt very relaxed. The location and views from the hotel were lovely and perfect for strolling around Bath and all it has to offer. Our visit was beyond our expectations and we look forward to returning in the future. Thank you"
3606,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Honestly the loveliest hotel I have ever stayed in. The staff were all friendly, professional and help, the grounds and hotel were beautiful (especially in the spring sunshine!) and the spa treatment was fantastic. I am already wanting to plan a return visit!"
3607,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We arrived mid morning. A number of staff greeted us with beaming smiles and words of welcome. We could not checkin on arrival so our luggage was safely stored. We were then able to go off and enjoy the beautiful city of Bath. We received a message when our room was ready and what a room it was. Overlooking a beautiful grassy park with people picnicking and playing. Dinner at the hotel restaurant a lovely experience despite negative reviews from some people..We were looked after by Noel, a young, pleasant fellow who took and delivered our meal with aplomb. Willing to engage in short conversations that did not interrupt our meal. Well done Noel, clearly a valued employee. Thank you Royal Crescent Staff for making our stay an ongoing pleasure."
3608,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"It's definitely a treat you need to save up for, but we were happy with our weekend at the Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa. Bath is a beautiful city to stroll around in the sunshine and it was lovely to come home to a four-poster bed, a cocktail and a truly excellent dinner. (And I mean really good.) On Sunday we used the pool and had spa treatments and didn't leave the grounds at all, just sunbathed and listened to the birds in the garden. Our only slight criticism was a shortage of staff which meant orders took a little long to arrive in the afternoon. Other than that it was faultless."
3609,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"This is a lovely hotel with a beautiful garden and is in a great location - just outside of the busier part of Bath. However I would avoid the restaurant and bar. The food was average and the restaurant service was very poor. I will likely try the hotel again, but would not book dinner or breakfast."
3610,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We stayed here for my wife’s 50th birthday celebration. This hotel, the service, the staff, food, amenities etc is exceptional. It is certainly the best hotel we have ever stayed in and will be returning. The anticipatory service of the staff is exemplary. If you want a special place, where you are treated like VIP’s, then books stay here. You will not be disappointed."
3611,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We would like to thank the fabulous staff at The Royal Crescent Hotel for making our wedding weekend so special! (A special shout out to Marrick as well as Martin & the rest of the concierge team). No request was too much (even when it was arranged for my wedding dress to be steamed the morning of our wedding last minute). A beautiful, idyllic haven! The Royal Crescent Hotel will forever have a special place in our hearts!"
3612,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"The title says it all! This was a fabulous break in a beautiful building. The staff could not have been more attentive and helpful, and although there were weddings and other functions taking place, at no time were we made to feel even remotely second best."
3613,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,We were met and greeted at the door by friendly and very courteous concierges. The start of a fabulous 5 day stay. Reception staff were efficient and showed us all the facilities of the hotel and room. They even arranged extra bedding brought promptly by the room service. Dinner and drinks in the restaurant were excellent and advised knowledgably on the wines to suit our tastes and meal. Breakfasts were fabulous. The spa was quiet and relaxing. With perfect weather we had a very enjoyable time and look forward to returning.
3614,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,The hotel was wonderful! The staff was terrific. Waitstaff was wonderful; spa staff was amazing - the staff went out of her way to get me a last minute treatment. Room was beautiful - overlooking the Gardens. We went to celebrate our anniversary and it was memorable experience. Thank you!!
3615,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"I really have nothing but positive things to say. The staff was amazing, the grounds beautiful, the room tremendous, the bed comfortable, and the food excellent. Even though this was a short stay, I left wishing it could have been longer."
3616,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"The ultimate treat! Expensive but a wonderful experience. Perfect location, beautiful city. Hotel is exceptional. Nothing to possibly want that they don’t have! Every corner of this hotel is unique and gorgeous!"
3617,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Overall excellent, especially the upgrade to the Beau Nash Suite for our 30th wedding anniversary. 2 night package including one afternoon tea and one 6 course tasting menu was very enjoyable and interesting. We will come again!"
3618,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,DONT BOOK A EVENT ! I saw what looked like a lovely dinner event on this hotels web site with David Downton . I booked for 4 and the payment for £155.00 per person was taken in full ( not a deposite ) Six days before the event it was cancelled. That in itself is not great but I appreciate these things happen . However I have been told I will receive my refund within ten days . So in fact after the date of tge event . When I asked why I was told the hotel had refunded my money to their bank ! It was basically no longer their responsibility but under the bank’s responsibility to pay . Terrible terrible service . I certainly won’t book another event here again
3619,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We had 5 nights in the hotel and could not fault any of the staff, they were all wonderful. The Montague is the best, the food was great. The hotel building is a must for anyone looking for an historic retreat with 21stCentury comfort."
3620,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We stayed at RCH for two nights, room was big but bed was small double felt for the price was a little underwhelming. Very clean hotel, turn down great, great concierge staff but the Montagu Mews restaurant service was poor, very slow and unorganised waiting staff unfortunately, appreciate it’s newly refurbished and will take time to adjust but for the price of 6-course tasting menu having to wait nearly 1 hour for the first course was disappointing. Breakfast was nice but again waiting staff mixing up table numbers and unorganised. The spa is small, not really much space to relax if you’re not in the pool or jacuzzi. We enjoyed the afternoon tea and sitting in the gardens which are beautiful. Would return as location is great but room for improvements given the price."
3621,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Best hotel in Bath, probably. A timetrip in the XVIII century with today's comfort and luxury. Exceptionally located in one of the most iconic buildings of this beautiful town, few minutes away from the centre"
3622,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"From start to finish our stay was magical. Clean beautiful room, spa and treatments were amazing and food was delicious. Staff were caring and polite. We had such a wonderful time and cant wait to come back soon."
3623,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Wonderful vistas over Bath and hotel full of character. Excellent , friendly and efficient staff. Good food at dinner and breakfast. We regretted that we didn't have time to use the spa or pool but will on a return occasion."
3624,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Excellent hotel in every way , brilliant large suite overlooking Royal Crescent , great bed, very quiet, exceedingly helpful staff. When only the best will do!! The gardens were just picturesque with all the spring tulips ,daffodils etc.Stay here and you wont regret it."
3625,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,Amazing afternoon tea - one of the best we’ve ever had. Particularly enjoyed the coronation chicken sandwich and the bath bun! The cake selection was 10/10. Service was impeccable. Really nice setting too.
3626,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"As soon as we left, I wanted to go back. I can't say enough. The hotel staff were warm and welcoming. The hotel and grounds were beautiful. The suite we were in, I think the Lord Nelson suite, was gorgeous. And the pull out bed for the kiddo was actually comfortable! During turn down they added an extra mattress topper, which made all the difference. They even found the little one's PJs on our bed and laid them on her little bed with her hotel robe and slippers. Adorable! We booked the bed and breakfast and really enjoyed the breakfast. We were very pleased that included in the breakfast were hot a la carte options. All of it was delicious. Their dinner options were not as appealing to the kiddo, so we mostly ate out in Bath for dinner and lunch. That worked out just fine. There…"
3627,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,The most attractive and relaxing hotels to stay at in the city. The service is spectacular and food is wonderful. It really has old world charm which makes the stay very special. Located close to the centre of town with wonderful gardens inside and outside the hotel.
3628,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"The Royal Crescent is a stunning, historical hotel with all the modern amenities one could ask for. Stunning rooms and grounds, and excellent staff. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Bath. We’ll definitely be back."
3629,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We had a lovely overnight stay including an afternoon tea and a spa treatment. The afternoon tea was delicious as was breakfast the next morning, the spa was lovely and all the members of staff were very welcoming and worked hard to make our stay a very memorable one. We will be returning as the whole experience was excellent."
3630,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Absolute wonderful hotel. The place is amazing and easy walking distance to city centre. The staff from concierge, reception, restaurant and spa were all outstanding! Exceptional to be honest. Warm and friendly atmosphere. I have to say the cooked breakfast has to be the best I’ve ever eaten in a hotel especially as I have to eat gluten free food. The staff were happy to add/ replace different items which I wasn’t fond of. Nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely be returning to this hotel. Thank you for great memories I shall treasure"
3631,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"If you are looking for a hotel experience rather than just a hotel stay then this is it. Cleverly hidden within the Royal Crescent in Bath, the staff have been well trained to pamper to (almost) your every need with a genuine sense of enthusiasm. Hotel stays are not cheap - but the experience is well worth it."
3632,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,Brilliant weekend getaway. Quiet yet lots of families and a lovely atmosphere. Staff were brilliant - nothing was too much to ask. Despite being on the younger side of the guests (25) we were treated with the best care and attentiveness.
3633,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Everything was excellent, the staff were amazing. But unfortunately the food was poor, and It is not up to the standard of an upscale hotel. The location is very good, close to mostly everything. Loved the garden as well."
3634,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We really enjoyed our short (1 night) stay in this hotel. The room was really comfortable, the breakfast perfect and the staff very attentive, holding an EV space in their car park for our late arrival. Couldn't see how it could be improved!"
3635,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Faultless, somewhat decadent and rather expensive. Booked a package with Spa treatments, afternoon tea and cocktails. Cocktail bar was excellent, locally sourced ingredients wherever possible. Afternoon tea was fine, staff are really good, enjoyed the understated elegance. Sadly some guests turned up to breakfast in sports clothing and trainers, well, you can't buy good taste."
3636,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa for four nights in March 2023. The hotel is absolutely gorgeous and our room was beautiful. The staff were very friendly and made sure everything from check-in to check-out to arranging a taxi for us to the train station was done well. The location of the hotel was exactly what we wanted - easy to walk to everything but a little removed so that it is very quiet at night. I would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a nice stay in Bath.
3637,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,This was my third stay at The Royal Crescent Hotel. It is a delightful place to stay. The location is perfect; the rooms are very comfortable; the staff are very attentive and the food is delicious. 10 out of 10 all round.
3638,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Our stay at the Royal Crescent started with a friendly welcome from the concierge staff who took care of our luggage and parked our car, check in was faultless and we enjoyed complementary champagne in the front lounge area, our room was very clean with a spotless bathroom. The decor and renovations were of a high standard and we’re in keeping with the period features of this superb Georgian building. Our evening was perfectly spent in the Montagu restaurant and bar where the food was top class and the cocktails superb. Our afternoon tea the next day was a lovely and relaxed experience with excellent quality sandwiches and pastries, thoroughly recommend it for an afternoon treat. The breakfasts are worth a mention also as the choice was varied and well prepared, also the buffet…"
3639,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Everything about it was spot on. The new restaurant is great and my wife was ecstatic about the vegan tasting menu. The best meal she's ever had. We will return.
3640,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,This hotel exudes understated elegance with exemplary service .The beautiful rooms and wonderful views added to the ambience breakfast in the Georgian drawing room overlooking the crescent was amazing the - choice food and service excellent. We had room service dinner on our night of arrival it was delicious and served beautifully on the room table and was piping hot !! The spa offers everything for comfort and relaxation it’s simply stunning What makes this hotel exceptional however is the service from its wonderful staff and the real extra perk was being able to have our car parked in the hotel garage for our entire stay when we needed it it was quickly delivered to the front of the hotel . Just perfect thank you all .
3641,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,We stayed last Sunday evening to meet Friends and a private dinner. The welcome from hotel staff was superb. Reception and chaps looked after us well. Took the car away and offered to put it on charge for no fees. Food and wine was excellent We will be back. Refreshing to see such great service. Well done
3642,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,An amazing 2 night stay. Amazing upgrade to a fantastic suite. Good food - they finished the restaurant refit on the second morning so we were the first to experience breakfast in the new restaurant which is beautifully decorated.
3643,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We were lucky enough to stay here as hotel guests, which we believe is the best way to experience the property and spa! Dinner at Montegue's Mews was fantastic! We had the best experience with the staff who were still clearly working out the kinks as it was only their second day open after a remodel. Liam was our server and he was professional but fun and made the dinner a really wonderful time. The hotel service wasn't always consistent but Quan was the exception. He greeted us the day we arrived and had the most welcoming and service oriented demeanor over other staff members we encountered. The spa was consistently crowded as anyone is allowed to use the facilities if they book a service. If you're a hotel guest you'll need to go very early or late in the day to have a…"
3644,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Bought a Spa package for my boyfriend’s 30th birthday (and special treat for myself). We used the spa, 60 min treatment each, champagne & truffles, and lunch. Absolutely spectacular experience. My massage with Nicole (or Nicola?) was 11/10 - especially that it was my first time and she was so calming and just fantastic. An absolute dream. Highly recommend the Aroma massage and champagne! Felt very comfortable and welcomed. Will absolutely return and spread the word how lovely it was. Perfect for couples, friends, or going solo…🧖🏻‍♀️🥂 5 Star!"
3645,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"Exceptional service and level of comfort and lived up to all expectations. Staff were all amazing, the peace and quiet of our ground floor suite was just perfect. Lorraine and her team run and amazing hotel, Will be back without doubt"
3646,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"A perfect experience from the moment we pulled up in the car to the moment we left the hotel. We appreciated lovely food, excellent wine and superb service. With the wonderful staff and room we most certainly will return and stay longer."
3647,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"We had a fantastic weekend at the RCH, perfect place for couples and friends enjoying a catch-up. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff, the spa is the best I have experienced and the afternoon tea to die for."
3648,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,I had a wonderful stay here and felt as if I was back in my own home. The staff were exceptional at catering to my needs whilst being quick and efficient. The spa facilities were just perfect at making me feel relaxed and ready for the day. Special thanks to the spa staff for being simply superb. I’m already planning my next stay!
3649,The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa,"I never actually got to the spa. I was due to visit this summer. I booked in a sizeable group WELL in advance, as it’s a special occasion and wanted to be sure we wouldn’t be left disappointed… If only I knew how disappointed I’d be! Got a call informing me they no longer could do my booking due to “planned operational issues” - really? On a Saturday, in the summer season, when there was a large group booked in for that day? Makes no business sense. They TOLD me my booking was moved, no consulting. When I said I couldn’t do the next day, I booked the Saturday specifically, I was told there’s nothing they could do. Here’s the kicker. This colleague told me the booking was moved DUE TO A PRIVATE HIRE. So, NOT planned operational works… So, despite booking well in advance,…"
3650,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"We stayed here with our two young children and loved it! There is so much for families to do - indoor and outdoor pools, tennis court, play areas, soft play etc and there is food available all day. Staff were friendly and the children were made to feel welcome. We stayed in a family room which was good for the four of us. Would definitely recommend - I actually got to read a bit of a book!!"
3651,Langstone Cliff Hotel,A lovey venue for a family Sunday Lunch . We opted for the carvery which was lovely but there was plenty of other options on the menu & the food coming out all looked good . Good value for money & excellent service from all the staff. We will definitely be going back!
3652,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Beautiful location with plenty of facilities to enjoy. Hotel cleaniless overally very good. Staff friendly but stretched during busy times. Food quality great but menu for specific dietary requirements could be improved especially if notice of stay was provided way in advance.
3653,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Another great stay! We have been as a couple before and recommended to family this time so a multi generation group and all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! We made use of all the facilities-table tennis, tennis and swimming! Room, staff, service and food all excellent!"
3654,Langstone Cliff Hotel,The hotel is easy to get to and sits in a wonderful location with a fantastic view of the sea. You are made to feel welcome and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. Extremely well organised and always a relaxing experience.
3655,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"As the weather was great, the facilities were ideal, just as good as being abroad. Service from staff was very good at all times. Breakfast service was spot on. All food was good quality. Overall a very good stay."
3656,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"This was a surprise trip for me, where all my family were waiting to join me for a surprise early birthday celebration. The staff were so helpful and friendly and the accommodation and amenities were outstanding. For a sea-view hotel, the standard of maintenance and decor was absolutely wonderful and the outdoor facilities were excellent- there was nothing that had not been thought about for families and guests, even down to changing facilities. We all LOVED our stay."
3657,Langstone Cliff Hotel,We love staying here. Reflected in this being our 11th visit in 8 years. This time only one night but an upgrade to a sea view room with balcony was such a luxury. Would recommend it to all (but don't want the whole world to visit!!!) Seriously wonderful for a day or stay.
3658,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"What a fabulous place everyone welcomed us. The food was great, the rooms comfortable and the gardens overlook the sea. Only a short break for us this time but looking forward to a longer stay in 2024."
3659,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Beautiful relaxing place to stay - ideal for dogs with excellent woodland walks on site. Good service throughout. Clean room . Reasonable Food .(breakfast particularly good). All the amenities you could need. Our 5th visit
3660,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Stayed five nights on half board basis. Ground floor room with sea view was spacious, comfortable and very clean. Modern shower room with great shower. Restaurant was superb. A combination of table and buffet service worked well. Quality of food was of a high standard and prepared in-house. New menu every night with at least two vegetarian options. The hotel has several comforably furnished lounge areas, some including the sun terrace with waiter service. The Langstone Cliff Hotel is a traditional hotel in the finest sense. From the facilities on offer, the quality of it's rooms and restaurant but most of all by all of the staff who give friendly, excellent service. I can recomend The Langstone Cliff Hotel without reservation."
3661,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Such a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere on arrival for our break. Customer service is excellent, nothing is too much trouble. Great facilities on site, there really is something for everyone. Location is stunning and we enjoyed soaking up the sun and the views from the terrace. A real gem."
3662,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Great location and lovely hotel, friendly staff and excellent food. Close to bus and train services allowing easy access to nearby attractions. Lovely warm indoor swimming pool and an out door pool. Will definitely come again."
3663,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Myself and my wife stayed here for our babymoon, we wanted a friendly hotel with plenty of amenities in a good location to beaches, other towns & days out and it was everything we wanted. We went midweek during term time so it was quiet and it was just us and older couples in the hotel for the stay. The hotels restaurant menu changed every night which was great and the breakfast had so much selection. The pool was warm which was great. The staff were constantly around the hotel cleaning and the serving staff couldn’t do enough for you and were very friendly. We had great night sleeps, I’m glad I got a room with AC as it was about 20-23 degrees each day so hot at night. Dawlish Warren’s coast is a short walk from the hotel which was lovely and there are so many lovely towns only…"
3664,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"It was a lovely sunny weekend, the hotel staff were very efficient. The view of the sea beautiful from the seating area. We felt very relaxed in what was a totally full hotel. We booked an all in with dinner included and possibly we might be more adventurous another time. Would stay here again."
3665,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Golf course nearby, lovely walks by the sea.very comfortable lounge, very nice garden to sit in also. Bedrooms are spacious. In the restaurant the food is good quality and plenty of choices. Alway a warm welcome."
3666,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Love this place. Rooms are so comfy, staff are very welcoming & friendly. Food is second to none. The garden is great to sit in and relax , amazing view over the sea. also in the lounge is as well."
3667,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Good location for other tourist spots ,friendly staff at all times serving very good food and well presented .The Rooms were very clean and serviced.The hotel is also ideally placed for a bus service to Dawlish, Teignmouth and beyond"
3668,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Found this gem as we needed a night near Cockwood and this was perfect. Room was clean and comfortable. All staff were helpful ordering taxis etc. it has beautiful grounds to sit outside and also inside is lovely.
3669,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Fantastic location and views, the families facilities are great and it makes holidays together so easy and so much fun! Already recommended to all my family for a group holiday! The staff as so attentive and friendly- can’t wait to come back"
3670,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Our 5th stay and the Langstone Cliff and once again, it didn’t disappoint. Nothing too much trouble. Park the car and log it in . Sit on one of the numerous comfortable settees or chairs , order a drink from where you sit or pop to the bar and chat to one of the fantastic staff. Arrive early , no problem, they will call you when your room is ready. All ages come and go and all seem to be returning guests. Which speaks volumes for the hotel. Sat and watched the coronation on the big screen and had a glass of bubbly brought around. The kids run around and no one bats an eyelid or complains. Many guests have disabilities. But again all catered for . Food is first class and not expensive. Rooms big, clean and well presented. If you want totally chilled weekend or you come as part…"
3671,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"As with many other guests this weekend, we are returnees. We get out of the car and relax. The staff (who never seem to change which in itself speaks volumes) are so lovely and welcoming. If ever there is a problem or we need something, it’s sorted immediately. Jane, Karen, Lauren and Zoe run a superb restaurant. Nothing was anything other than excellent, but Johns cheesecake 7/5/23 was absolutely sublime, thank you. Great food again😊 Housekeeping can be really proud of what they do, everywhere always really clean Reception staff are all lovely, thanks for the scrabble, always helpful and welcoming Ben runs a really good bar (good luck in London next week Hayley, break a leg!). Again thank you🍷🍺 This is a wonderful place to recharge, thank you and see you again (soon)"
3672,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"We had a wonderful 5 day stay at this hotel. The food was excellent, with lots of choices, all prepared by the chefs. The staff were very helpful really cheerful, and the hotel was first class, couldn't fault it. We will be back!"
3673,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"The Langstone never fails in it's good service, and friendly staff. Brilliant restaurant with buffet service is good for us, as we each like different things. You can have as little or as much as you fancy."
3674,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Just got home from a fantastic weekend. Staff very friendly and welcoming. Food fantastic and entertainment very good. Facilities great both inside and out. Well worth a visit. We will be back soon.
3675,Langstone Cliff Hotel,I feel that a couple of things could require attention so as to improve the hotel. I would certainly stay there again if I'm in the area at anytime. It's a pity that a few rooms are not kept for only people and no dogs are allowed to stay in these rooms. There is still a 'doggy smell' in the hotel especially on a wet day.
3676,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"I cannot recommend this hotel enough! From the minute we arrived to the time we left all was excellent! Staff lovely and welcoming, food delicious with wide choice and facilities brilliant - loved the pool! Overall outstanding we will be back! Xx"
3677,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Took my mum here for her 90th birthday to meet an old friend. Staff were very helpful and did all they could to make her stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible. We have visited her a number of times before and the staff are always helpful and friendly.
3678,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Lovely walk into Dawlish and Powderham was a great place to visit. Staff are very friendly, pleasant and helpful. Can't wait to return later in the year. Our fourth time here as we find it very relaxing."
3679,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Lovely hotel, really friendly and helpful staff. Excellent food. Beautiful decor throughout the hotel. Only downer was the floorboards in our bedroom,very noisy but house is over 300 years old. So not surprising. Would definitely go there again."
3680,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"A charming, nostalgic hotel with a family feel! We stayed here before Easter with our 4 year old son. Pros: Location is great. An easy walk to the seafront and to the funfair, arcades and restaurants. The hotel is clearly loved and whilst the decor is very dated it is clean and well cared for. Room was quiet and comfortable Good shower Most staff were very kind, chatty and helpful Plenty of car parking Great breakfast Pool is a great addition and changing facilities clean and tidy Cons: food was quite expensive and not that great One lady who worked behind the bar was quite rude to customer and other staff. (Everyone else was lovely!) Although the inside was well kept the outside is a little scruffy and would benefit from a lick of paint. Overall we had a fabulous…"
3681,Langstone Cliff Hotel,On the minus side. Extractor fan in bathroom noisy and toilet seat creaked. The entrance to the hotel was a bit shabby but ongoing to the hotel it was a mixture of old world to modern and quite plush the room was comfortable and the towels the fluffiest we have ever had. Food excellent and varied on the evening menu. Staff were extremely polite and helpful hair dryer packed up on last day phoned reception and another one was there in 2 minutes. This is a family hotel run extremely well. When the approach to the hotel is renovated it will be perfect so don’t be put off when you arrrive. Great job to all the staff. Thank you
3682,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"An enjoyable stay at Langstone Cliff Hotel was much better than first expected. The cleanliness customer service and meals were fantastic. Definitely a place I would Recommend.to anyone stopping in Devon ,Dog and children friendly with so many amenities available for guests."
3683,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Hotel has character old world charm welcoming. Staff are hardworking efficient friendly and helpful.Great location looking out to sea nice gardens and facilities enjoyed indoor swimming pool.Nice clean comfortable room with all you need.Good position for walking along coastal path. Only one suggestion would be to have a slot for adult swimming . Good selection of food at breakfast and dinner.
3684,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Langstone is ideal for family holidays. The location with plenty of grounds, dog friendly and excelent food. The rooms are clean and practical and children's entertainment most nights. Our third visit and we will be booming again for next Easter soon."
3685,Langstone Cliff Hotel,An ideal hotel which caters for all ages....our party was 13-80 and there was something for everyone. The staff go out of their way to make the stay so enjoyable. We will definitely return for whatever reason
3686,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"We stayed with our 2 kids as part of a larger family group. I used to come as a child so it was great to take my children back. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the hotel has everything you need. The kids had a great time in the pool and play room each day. The arcades, just a short walk away, were also a hit with the children. We had breakfast and dinner included and ate lunch there several days too. There was plenty on offer for kids and adults. For breakfast there was a self service cooked breakfast which was always well stocked, cereal, toast, porridge, yoghurt and fruit. My kids would have appreciated some pancakes or muffins but they usually had enough to eat. Dinner is also self service (apart from starter and dessert) and there was always lots of choice for…"
3687,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"We attended a dance holiday weekend with our dance school group from Worthing, West Sussex, arriving and departing by coach. First impressions of the outside of the building belie the indoors. Unprepossessing, flat-roofed, blocky extensions turn into a warm, welcoming and comfortable mid-range hotel, with good facilities, bar, restaurant and - most importantly for our group - function room with large dance floor. Our room was in the older part of the main building, with all the usual facilities, large comfortable bed and surprisingly, air-conditioning, which was invaluable. Service was excellent, staff friendly, food good and organisation for our large group activities (drink receptions, meals and dance events) very good. Immediate access to the Dawlish Costal Path, Sea Wall…"
3688,Langstone Cliff Hotel,We stayed for one night as a break in our journey. Had stayed previously. We were very disappointed Don't know what we expected but it was not what we got. The staff did what the could with what they had but there was just something lacking. If you know your Agatha Christie a bit like Bartrams without the murder!
3689,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Well we had a really good experience this time we stayed at the Langstone Cliff hotel with our dance group. We stayed here last year & were not impressed I did write a review last year stating that. So to be fair I am writing another review. This time the food was excellent, plenty of choice & all the food was really nicely cooked, vegetables were cooked to perfection, & the food was really tasty. The rooms are clean & it looks like the owners are updating the bathrooms ours was definitely new & revamped. The mirror was fab, it lit up & no demisting!! The public rooms, bars & dance room were good & the decor& soft furnishing were very nice. Hotel has the advantage of standing in it's own grounds, lovely gardens & views over the sea. Staff are very friendly & helpful."
3690,Langstone Cliff Hotel,The staff were very friendly and welcoming and the room was excellent. Lovely view of the sea from the very well kept garden. The food was great and the overall service was perfect. Highly recommended.
3691,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"My wife and I have always favoured North Devon, and never been to Dawlish. Despite the utmost in curiosity I prefer to wait for first impressions rather than be steamrolled down that of another's personal experience. With that in mind we duly arrived at The Langstone Cliff Hotel to be greeted by a tired looking building in need of a lick of paint and some TLC. Inside was a different story. It was like we'd been transported somewhere else. The atmosphere and furnishings were warm and inviting; the staff were attentive and busy; the bedroom and all public rooms were like having a warm blanket around you, protecting you from the slings and arrows of misey and misfortune. Having returned home the first thing I did was to buy a Langstone piggy bank. Roll on next visit!"
3692,Langstone Cliff Hotel,Exceptional value for money hotel. Has everything you could possible want. Hotel well organized and in a beautiful setting. Rooms very clean. Friendly and helpful staff. Facilities and service excellent. Buffet service for hot breakfast items and main course at dinner.
3693,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Short few days away for my wife and I May lack character on the outside, but inside a very good balance of character and modern with that cosy feel at home edge Book in was quick and efficient with a warm welcome, we were slightly early and waited with drink in lounge area, our cases were safely stored for us during this short period, once room was ready they came to find us and completed check in accordingly Room was on first floor, with rear view, large double, plenty of storage Bathroom was shower over bath good size and with fluffy towels and face cloth, alongside a good range of soaps etc As a surprise for my wife i had pre ordered some Prosecco and flowers, and all in room ready and the flowers were super The restaurant slightly strange as all but the mail course is…"
3694,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Nice location, with friendly and helpful staff. Room had a sea view and was comfortably furnished. Just remember that the railway runs along by the sea so you will see, and possibly hear, the occassional train."
3695,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"A great place to stay, staff were friendly and accommodating, great choice for buffet breakfast, quality and quantity. Plenty of activities from swimming(open air and indoor), snooker, tennis and play area for children. Dog friendly too. Amazing place, will be back in the summer."
3696,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"My husband and I visited the hotel for an afternoon tea for a special treat on our wedding anniversary. We were seated in one of the lounges immediately next to a group of 4 people, 2 couples obviously staying there, who were quietly reading and chatting. There was no one at that time seated in the room so plenty of free space. We wondered why we had been placed there! Our food arrived and on first view it looked very appetising. Almost as soon as we started to eat a female member of staff arrived, stood behind one of the sofas near to us and proceeded to chat with one of the couples. Her voice began to rise and so did the visitors’. She proceeded to describe the toileting habits in full detail of a young child which really was not the appropriate thing to do when we…"
3697,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 days in late February. We had an enjoyable experience in this traditional family run hotel. Our room was on the first floor overlooking the coastline. Room service and cleanliness was excellent and all the public areas were clean and tidy. The restaurant was clean and offered a suitable range of food choices at breakfast and dinner. We did have an issue with service st our first evening meal which we reported to the reception, but we were contacted by the general manager the following day to discuss and resolve. On our second day we had afternoon tea which was a real treat in the lounge overlooking the gardens. As with many places, there were small things that could possibly have been improved, but overall we both really enjoyed our stay and…"
3698,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"This was our 5th stay at Langstone Cliff Hotel and we've never had any complaints. It's in a great location, quiet and secluded. Ll the staff are friendly and efficient. We will return. again next year"
3699,Langstone Cliff Hotel,"Did not meet their reputation. Bedroom was clean but a little tired, although it did have a really nice ensuite. Pillows and duvet were poor quality and we had a very little sleep. However the room was a refreshingly good temperature, not too hot. The food was poor, so based on this experience we will not be booking another stay."
3700,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Our stay at the Daffodil Hotel was magnificent. The location is ideal for exploring the Lakes and it’s setting overlooking Grasmere Lake is idyllic. We asked for a quiet room and it was peaceful,clean and with a great view up the valley. The Spa facilities were one of the reasons for choosing the hotel and the hydro-pool, steam room and sauna were just what we needed to relax into the holiday. The food at breakfast, at the bar, on the terrace and in the restaurant could not be faulted - so good we didn’t go anywhere else. We also need to mention how great all the staff were - absolutely spot on. We cannot recommend the Daffodil highly enough and will definitely return."
3701,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We only stayed for one night, but what a lovely experience. Very pet friendly no issues whatsoever highly recommend the daffodil hotel. The grounds of the hotel absolutely gorgeous and fantastic views. The staff were brilliant, although we couldn’t take our pet in the dining room they catered for us in the sitting room which is a lovely room we had it all to ourselves. Top 5 stars from us keep up the fantastic work you are doing."
3702,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,it was a wonderful vacation the hotel position is perfect to travel all area. the room was big and with all the facilities required . breakfast was good but there was no cappuccino ( suggest more vegetables ). we got from mr Chreas all the information and recommendation .
3703,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it. On checking in we found an issue with the room which the hotel staff tried, but were unable to resolve during our stay. As the hotel was at capacity they were unable to move our room but the duty manager agreed a compensation straight away. Aside from the issue with the room we found the room very clean and with all appropriate amenities. The bathroom was newly done and the water pressure of the shower was great! We didn’t use the spa however did get a tour and had we been there longer and in less fabulous weather we certainly would have used it. The location is fabulous with a 10 minute walk into Grasmere itself. The hotel grounds are lovely and the outdoor seating for drinks make full use of the views. Finally the food. We had an…"
3704,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We enjoyed the beautiful setting and that it was just a few minutes walk into lovely Grasmere. Very much enjoyed the good quality food at the restaurant. We used the spa facility and thought treatments available were good value for money. The hotel is good, but could do with some updating in the patio area where garden furniture looked tired. Could have also benefited from a dedicated professional bartender as drinks were slow to be made and cocktails inconsistent according to the waiting staff making it. Otherwise, a good experience."
3705,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We had a 3rd floor room (305) with a lovely view. Sadly window didn’t open and as the weather was getting better, the room was just too stuffy for us. Didn’t spend much time there, other than to sleep. I would suggest asking for a room with an opening window. We only had dinner in hotel on one night. It was nice but expensive and there were many places in Grasmere to eat for half the price. Grasmere is lovely. Breakfast was great. There is no fridge provided in the rooms. but they did eventually bring one which was helpful. I though fridges were standard now? It’s a nice hotel but rooms were just all white and a bit soulless in our opinion. I don’t think we’ll be back."
3706,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We came here to celebrate the start of our honeymoon and had a wonderful time. Everything is first class - location, staff, food, rooms etc etc. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. if you're looking for a genuinely luxurious stay in the lakes that still feels like home, book today."
3707,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,Place is at very beautiful location. Staff are very friendly. Beds are uncomfortable for couple and they are 2single beds joined together. The bed was uneven couldn’t sleep properly on the 2nd night. When they say full body massage it doesn’t cover your head massage. And it was not even full 60 mins massage. 60mins include the relaxing time as well.
3708,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel, as the spa, restaurant, rooms, service, and staff were all exceptional. The staff was incredibly helpful and polite, making our experience even more enjoyable. We particularly loved the mud therapy, and we have already recommended the hotel to our friends."
3709,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"The place is beautiful, the surroundings are stunning, the staff were wonderful, the food was amazing, our room (junior suite) was absolutely immaculate with stunning views, we’ve stayed at all the big name hotels in the lakes and this was our best experience, steak on the evening was perfect, breakfast was very good, service was impeccable, the place is immaculate clean. Other spa hotels allow a “2 hour booking for entry to spa” the daffodil allows entry during all open hours to residents exactly how it should be, sitting on the terrace the views are stunning, a member of staff always about to take drink orders and bring them to your table, waiting on your evening meal bread and butter was offered another good traditional restaurant practice, nice big car park, 10 minute walk…"
3710,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We visited with friends for husband’s birthday celebrations - spa, dinner, bed and breakfast. Lovely stay. Food was absolutely delicious. Staff couldn’t have been more friendly. The price wasn’t the cheapest but we had a lovely weekend enjoying the spa and the hotel facilities and the hotel had upgraded one of our rooms when we arrived. Would definitely visit again."
3711,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"A quality hotel with outstanding attention to detail and service. Rooms were exceptionally clean and spacious, the grounds were immaculate and the hospitality first rate right the way through from the cleaning staff to the front of house. Friendly, warm and welcoming."
3712,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"This hotel is a lovely place to stay Every one is so kind , the food is excellent And the location great for a good walk and some great views. We walked to the famous gingerbread shop I would recommend trying delicious"
3713,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Lovely hotel with great views, situated on edge of Grassmere. Food for dinner and breakfast was amazing. Staff are really nice, helpful without being in your space. Spa really nice. Rooms large and immaculate. Whats not to like!!"
3714,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,Beautiful hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Lulu in the spa did me a wonderful leg and foot massage. Food very good breakfast amazing. Why I didn't give 5 stars was No glasses in bathroom to place toothbrushes and toothpaste in. No shower cap. In a hotel this good they should be in the rooms. Nevertheless we would return.
3715,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Clean and tidy but very clinical, very nice bathrooms. Bed was large and comfortable, however sleep was very poor due to the continual noise emanating from the hotel storage cabinets next to the room, after explaining to reception we were told and shown it was the hotel main air conditioning system creating the noise . avoid room 214. Breakfast as one would expect of a large hotel with a good variety of choice"
3716,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We had heard so much about the hotel that we asked for vouchers from work. The hotel is soulless and not great value for money. Our room had no bath, a stain on the carpet and overlooked the solar panels."
3717,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Myself and my partner booked the stay for our mini moon after our wedding and we are so glad we did, we got a room upgrade and congratulations card on arrival, food was the best I have ever had and the staff were incredible, thank you!"
3718,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Wonderful , scenic stay. Beautiful view over the lake from our third floor room and lovely terrace at ground level for refreshments. Enjoyable dinner and breakfast. Friendly staff. Easy walk into Grasmere which is beautiful. We are definitely hoping to return."
3719,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Stunning location, fantastic friendly staff. Went for a wedding and stayed an extra night, was perfect for both the event and just for a couple's getaway. We used the restaurant for breakfast only which was high quality. Very close to number of restaurants, 10 minute walking distance. Quite expensive but was worth it for me."
3720,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Spent a short trip here (may 2023) First positive. Plenty of parking! Its a fantastic location and building that has great potential but seriously lacks character. The reception staff we encountered were very different. Some pleasant but one particular lady was a sarcastic piece of work who certainly discouraged us from re booking The bar area was seriously lacking staff. We wandered around looking for someone to order drinks off but gave up. Also reception staff had gone awol. I think there are serious staff shortage here. Maybe why the stroppy lady on reception manages to get away with it, nobody to replace her. The spa itself is ok. A small pool and steam room. Both average. Doors in spa area could be cleaned or painted, looking old. The relaxation room though is pleasant…"
3721,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Best hotel I have ever stayed in my life so far. The staff provided excellent service, from the reception to the restaurant staff: top-notch service. Would definitely visit this hotel and highly recommended for anyone looking for value for money stay 😊"
3722,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,Our stay at the hotel was wonderful and all of the staff were friendly and attentive. The spa was relaxing and well worth the money. It's just a short walk away from Grasmere centre which is full of places to eat and drink. I would definitely recommend and will be coming back soon!
3723,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,What a fantastic stay . Wedding preparation was flawless and last minute set up for outdoor wedding was perfect food was amazing and friendly helpful staff were brilliant all day helping us with all the little details a welcome session in the spa was great and the facilities were brilliant thank you so much for such wonderful memories
3724,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"First time staying at this hotel. We had the Lakeview room and the views were beautiful. Room was clean, large king-size bed which was comfortable. Ordered room service twice and the food was unbelievably good. I knocked a star off because on the first night we stayed, we had no water in the room. I called reception so many times no one answered. I went downstairs and managed to find someone to give me a bottle of water. But when I tasted it, it was so bad! I couldn't take another sip. I was told there was a water filter tank on my floor which if I had been told when I arrived, it would have saved me a lot of time trying to find water. No nearby shops otherwise I would have gone out to get it. Also there isn't a lot of choice at breakfast either. No non-dairy milks either.…"
3725,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Would highly recommend this amazing hotel and spa, the treatments were lovely and the room itself had breathtaking views. The hotel food was lovely except for the afternoon tea which I would stay away from"
3726,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,My daughter and I stayed for one night. All the staff is friendly and professional. The restaurant food is great! The Spa is a bit “tired”.. but we want to give a special mention to Lulu from the spa who made me enjoy the best facial I have ever had. We will be back for more treatments!
3727,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"It was my girlfriends 30th birthday and the hotel made sure it was special, from a birthday card in the room to a dessert platter at dinner, the room was beautiful, we had a Mountain View room and the views were unbelievable, all of the staff were happy to help with any questions we had, I would recommend a stay here to anyone!"
3728,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Beautiful location and building on the outside but could be anywhere once on the inside. All very clean, staff very friendly, lovely spa but just lacked character for such a beautiful building and location. Note that valley rooms overlook the car park."
3729,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"I recently spent time at The Daffodil Hotel and Spa. The welcome when we arrived was excellent. We went for a room with a lake view and were delighted. We felt the spa was a decent enough size with plenty of space for everyone. We’d booked to eat in at the hotel. We were handed a different menu to what I’d seen on line. I assumed perhaps the website hadn’t been updated. The one I was handed had less variety, and a higher price bracket for some courses. After we ordered our food, I noticed another table were receiving the food I’d seen on the on-line menu. I asked a waitress if there was another menu from the one we’d been given. She said yes there was, so I asked to see it. A minute or two later another member of staff came over to our table. I’d guess he was the…"
3730,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"A lovely hotel in a stunning location. The staff were very helpful and pleasant, especially Fernando. The rooms were very comfortable and the views were amazing, The only criticism was after a day in the country the lack of easy chairs in our room did not help us to relax. The lounge and central facilities were very pleasant."
3731,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Fantastic hotel, beautifull, room was brilliant ,breakfast is amazing .. would def return here without hesitation ,the view from the bedroom looked out over the lake ..if your considering grasmere or nearby .. this woukd be my choice."
3732,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Excellent hotel from the minute we arrived to leaving after a 4 day DBB stay, Ample parking which was great. Really good location between Keswick about 12 miles on one side walking distance to Grasmere. Short drive to Ambleside and Windermere made all the difference. We have stayed many times in the Lake District but this hotel for location and excellent service was our favourite."
3733,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We always return to The Daffodil Hotel as we think it's the best place to stay in the Lakes. We had a full on jaw-dropping view of Grasmere Lake and surrounding hills. Our room was spacious and clean and the bed was huge. Breakfasts are always high quality. Daffodil Hotel is in a fantastic position on the most beautiful road in England (A591) and very easy to access the best places to visit and to walk e.g. Helvellyn, Windermere, Ambleside, White Moss Walks etc. All the staff are very courteous too."
3734,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,To celebrate a birthday it's a great treat to find a lovely hotel in a beautiful setting. We had a relaxing stay in the Daffodil in a double room for B&B booked directly with them. The staff were good and the food in the restaurant at breakfast and dinner was delicious. The setting was lovely as can be seen from the photograph and I think this might be somewhere we would return.
3735,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,First time to the Lakes for my goddaughter wedding. Amazing hotel with quality staff. Wedding break feast was amazing and food generally very good. Brilliant location for a wonderful and beautiful time. Thanks to Management and all the helpful staff
3736,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"fantastic hotel, upon check in the front desk staff were absolutely lovely and very helpful. massive thank you to Dean which made our anniversary the one to always remember. the spa facilities are great, the staff at the spa are very professional and helpful, the spa provides towels, hair dryer and hair straightener, there is facility to dry your swim suit. spa has lockers as well for your personals. there is 2 bars one on ground floor one on first floor. the restaurant is located on the first floor. at the dining service we were served by amazing Fernando and the service was great, the food at the restaurant is amazing its worth the price. there is also carpark on site. overall its an amazing place to spend your weekend at and relax."
3737,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Great location for walking, good facilities on site for those rainy days ! Spacious comfortable bedrooms, friendly helpful staff and a very nice restaurant. Views of either the Lake or mountains all around the hotel, ample free parking yet only a short walk into the village itself."
3738,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Excellent Hotel. Good food, friendly and helpful staff. One small negative… evening bar was inaccessible due to very large wedding party. This line is just to reach the 200 character minimum requirement to submit a review."
3739,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"One of the best places to stay in the Lakes, if you are looking for a tranquil setting. Away from the bigger towns, but convenient if you don’t mind driving a little or getting the buses. Hopefully will be back again."
3740,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff, delicious food, excellent spa!! My husband had a wonderful birthday! Wish we could be informed in advance if our room will or will not have a bathtub upon reservation though."
3741,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"The service excellent but our experience in general was little bit bad. We stayed hundred times before and now we discover the standards were being reduced. No bathrobe for big people, and the carpet room stained and dusted"
3742,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"what a fabulous location. The hotel itself is a picturesque building but it's price would lead me to expect more. Poor wardrobe space, noisy air conditioning, limited dining menu, restrictive interpretation of what can be bought with the fully pre-paid dining allowance"
3743,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,We stayed here for our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. Fantastic views from the room and close to Grasmere village this is a top hotel. Spa facilities were very good and the food was exceptional.
3744,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Quite simply the most amazing staff, service and attitude we have ever experienced. A team full of professionals that made our wedding on 11 April the most amazing day to remember. Thank you so much to Katie the wedding manager who was outstanding and to all the staff in the restaurant who made our stay perfect. Facilities were brilliant, the Spa is amazing (my partner said it's the best facial she has ever had) and the food was out of this world. Thank you Daffodil! An absolute must for any visitor to the Lake District!"
3745,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"I treated myself to this amazing spa hotel in the Lake District and it was the best decision ever! I took a solo trip from London by public transport (absolutely fine as long as the trains are on time!) - the bus from Windermere station is direct and stops only less than a minute's walk from the hotel. Everything from the welcome, the room (I booked a lake view room and emailed to ask for a top floor room, which they granted!), the massage and spa (fantastic), dinner and breakfast (very generous!) and the helpful information about walking around the nearby village was just fantastic. I stayed only one night but I should have stayed two nights at minimum. The rooms aren't the most sound proof (I was very aware that whoever was below me may have heard me walking around) but for…"
3746,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Perfect weekend, excellent staff, brilliant location , stunning scenery, great food. Daffodil Hotel, Grasmere, the Far Easedale Round in perfect weather and climbing up Nab Scar with stunning views over Rydal Water and the Langdales made this a weekend to remember."
3747,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"Excellent stay again at the Daffodil. We also had great service from Andrei when we ate in the lounge during the evening.All the staff were helpful, and we thoroughly enjoyed using the spa. We hope to be back soon."
3748,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,"We stayed for 5 nights as a family. Unfortunately the hotel could not offer interconnecting rooms, but we had rooms next to each other. The rooms are really modern and spotlessly clean. The beds were comfortable with soft pillows. We had a separate shower and bath. We had a lovely view of the mountains. We went on a HB basis, although I would recommend B&B as HB is only an allowance, so you may as well choose to have dinner there if you wish. The menu choice was also too limited for me for HB, as I am pescatarian and the menu is more meat / steak oriented. I was surprised that the burger menu had no vegetarian option- almost unheard of these days. Breakfast was really good. Overall the hotel is well-staffed, service and housekeeping is good. The location is a short walk to…"
3749,The Daffodil Hotel & Spa,A great stay at this lovely hotel. Excellent location. Room 306 had an amazing view. The food was delicious. The spa was restful. The staff were efficient and friendly. Easy walk into Grasmere. A great base for a number of exciting walks around the area
3750,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"I must compliment the hotel management for your superb reception and welcome staff. In particular, Robert who assisted me with parking and taking my suitcases from the car to the reception desk. He was an absolute joy to meet and could not have been more helpful throughout this business trip. As I was attending a work Board Meeting, Rob and his colleagues were asked to assist us on multiple occasions. Nothing was too much trouble. Incredible service. Thank you."
3751,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Great hotel, and great staff. The location was perfect and beautiful. Free gin in the room was a special touch. Very comfortable beds and nice bar and restaurant on top floor. We would stay there again."
3752,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Lovely welcome from Benjamin who helped with our bags. 5 stars! Easy to find and parking. Room let Benjamin's efforts down though... No hand soap at sink or in shower and dirty spoons for coffee. Real shame. Breakfast was pretty good though.
3753,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"We stayed here for two nights prior to our cruise. The hotel and room were fantastic. Everything was clean, modern and worked well. The location is a bit off the beaten path, but walkable to the nearby, shopping center and restaurants. I loved the views of the cruise ships coming in and out. The touch of having Jen included in the room was a nice bonus. The staff was also spectacular and very helpful."
3754,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Number 1 in Southampton , great staff from checking in , to bar and restaurant , good service , nice food , rooms were clean and large fully recommend a stay here if you are visiting or taking a cruise as they have a free shuttle to your ship, great surroundings in the harbour with lovely restaurants all walkable"
3755,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Fabulous break everything was first class will definitely book again From where the hotel is situated from the room with balcony and lovely breakfast 5 Star from beginning to end it was the end to a lovely holiday
3756,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Celebrated my first wedding anniversary at this lovely hotel. Danny assisted with making my room extra special for the day. I was greeted warmly and had a wonderful chat with Amelia and Mel on arrival. Room was spotless and very comfortable
3757,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,What a location! Room with a view. Breakfast in the roof top restaurant was stunning. And the full English was also really well cooked with great buffet continental options and efficient table service. Had the tasting menu downstairs the night before - lots of fun and again great service. Spa and pool well appreciated. Shower needed some work on the mixer and as usual a too hot duvet but otherwise room was perfect. The complimentary gin was a nice touch too.
3758,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Stayed in this hotel 1 night before going to a cruise. Confortable bedroom with lovely terrasse with sea view. Good food in both restaurants and excellent and efficient service . A special thanks to the concierge and reception staff who were faultless.
3759,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Excellent service from the moment you walk in. Spotless rooms, spa, gym and restaurants with unrivalled views across the marina. I love staying here and given the option I travel on business) would not go anywhere else."
3760,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"We stayed at the Harbour Hotel in Southampton last night and had a fabulous time. The hotel is tastefully decorated in a classy but relaxed style. The rooms are a good size, clean and stylish with high, comfy beds. Ours had a view of the marina which we enjoyed whilst drinking our delicious complementary gin. We ate in Harvard on 6th. Tasty pizzas (quite heavy on the cheese though) and delicious cocktails. We ate in a booth with another great view and a DJ added some Friday night atmosphere. Breakfast was also served here and there was s fantastic continental spread as well as a range of cooked breakfast choices on offer. The staff were all attentive, helpful, polite as smiling. Nothing was too much trouble. I’m now even more excited about my half term stay at the Harbour…"
3761,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Another absolutely PERFECT pre cruise stay at this amazing hotel. A special treat of 2 nights this time, as it was also a birthday/retirement celebration. Time after time we are absolultely blown away by this hotel - from the standard of accomodation, to the excellent staff, to the delicious food - breakfast is definitely not to be missed! Can't wait for our next stay"
3762,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"We stayed at the hotel for our nephews wedding which was held there, and really enjoyed it. The hotel is immaculate, the views stunning and the staff very helpful. Especially Danny one of your reception team, nothing was to much trouble, sorting car parking beforehand as the boat show was running, explaining where to park and what to do with the ticket etc, where we could get changed if our room wasn’t ready (which it was) so professional, a real asset to your team 10/10."
3763,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,The staff are really professional and friendly … the Restuarant and bar offer amazing food almost fine dining style and delicious. The Restuarant looks out on the Habour and is stunning. Breakfast is served on a higher floor which also looks out on the harbour. The cuppa chino can be hotter but over all the breakfast is fair. Waiters are attentive and courteous all the time.
3764,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"I had a spacious, light and airy room, with all the facilities you would expect in a five star hotel. I dined in the Jetty Restaurant and had the tasting menu, with a flight of wines to match. The standard of catering was what you would expect in a five star hotel, and the Sommelier was knowledgeable about the wines, and friendly, without being intrusive. I had breakfast in the other restaurant on the sixth floor with good views across the river. I had the cooked breakfast and was served to the standard you would expect in a hotel of this calibre. One of the concierge staff helped me with my luggage to my room and explained the facilities and was knowledgeable and friendly."
3765,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"What an absolutely beautiful hotel! The building itself is so unique as it actually looks like a cruise ship. Checking in, the staff could not be nicer. When I went up to my room I couldn't believe how gorgeous it was. Not the largest room I ever stayed in but certainly more than enough room and so beautifully decorated with two large ceiling to floor windows (well one was a window and one was a door to get to the balcony). I love all the nautical design touches with the wooden teak looking doors, and soothing light blue, tan and white color schemes. The touches of orange just made it all come together so beautifully. The entire hotel is decorated stunningly. Even the built-in closets with coffee maker and automatic lights are fantastic. The bed is high, fluffy and very…"
3766,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Stayed here for one night payed just over £200 for small room with a balcony. Room was nice, view partially looked over harbour and partially over a block of flats and multi-storey car park. Room had good air con, smart tv with lots of freeview channels. Room safe, ironing board and tea/coffee making facilities. Modern bathroom with rainfall shower. Very comfortable super king size bed. Complimentary gin in room, however don’t get too excited as it’s only four shots at most. They provide a huge LSA decanter with only a little amount of gin in the bottom, feels like they either forgot to fill it up more or are cost cutting, as no sherry either? All other snacks and drinks are chargeable. Check you bill after check out as i was charged for something I did not have - housekeeping…"
3767,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Booked online for a one night pre-cruise treat with my husband and parents. On arrival the concierge immediately approached and accompanied my husband to get all of our luggage from the car park. Check in was fast, efficient and friendly. We took my parents to their room and then went to find our room. I had booked a Balcony room for myself and my husband. On entering the room I had a Vertigo attack, as I suffer from Acrophobia, and froze. The room was absolutely beautiful and had 3 large floor to ceiling windows as well as a small balcony. I had to get my husband to close the curtains immediately. I knew I wouldn't be able to stay in the room. My husband returned to reception and explained what had happened and to see if it would be possible to change rooms. In…"
3768,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"A wonderful afternoon tea with the family. Great location, great service from all staff, great afternoon tea with good selection of sandwiches, cakes and scones. Definitely recommend this hotel and we will return for dinner in the future."
3769,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Tucked away down side streets you’ll find this beautiful hotel overlooking The Harbour. The warmest welcome awaits when you stay at this hotel from the moment you step in the door. The staff are happy to inform you of what is available in the hotel and surroundings areas. The concierge staff are very willing to assist and go out of their way to offer help with luggage, car parking etc. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble. Our room was spotless, a little small with the huge comfortable bed in it, but perfect for a great sleep. The bar is very welcoming and a great place to while away the time. We will definitely stay again."
3770,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The rooms are wonderful, we had a deluxe room with marina room which was large, comfortable, immaculate and had the most amazing view. You may think that would be enough - there is more.... we had dinner in the HarBar, which is where you also have breakfast, and the meals were superb (as was breakfast). Surely that's enough to recommend this hotel however there is even more, the staff are simply outstanding. It doesn't matter who or where they all go out of their way to make sure you are welcome and have everything to enjoy your stay. We have already booked to come back later in the year."
3771,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Our second stay at this hotel an we've booked again for later in the year. We stay pre cruise as it's the best hotel and very close to the terminal. It's a beautiful hotel with amazing, comfortable rooms and you even get free gin!! The staff are all helpful and friendly and the spa facilities are excellent. There is free parking either across the road or in the multi storey a 5 minute walk away. If you're off on a 5* cruise, who wants to start off in a 2* T/Lodge? Start your holiday properly at this hotel!!"
3772,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Amazing hotel, fantastic location, beautiful views, superb facilities, luxurious room with the most amazing bed and bedding. Staff were so professional, polite and courteous and nothing was too much trouble for them. I enjoyed the hotels interior decoration and furnishings. The inclusion of really interesting books in the bedrooms and public places meant I left with a long book wishlist. There really was nothing negative to say about this hotel. The only area that potentially could have been a problem was the amount of car parking spaces, however although it was full when we drove in with people waiting for spaces it didn't take long for a space to become available. Had that not been the case I would hope there is an overflow carpark close by."
3773,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"I would give this hotel 6 out of 5 if I could. The service was great, some really stand out moments of staff going above and beyond. The hotel itself is amazing and really well thought out - the rooms are beautiful and I would definitely recommend booking one with a balcony. We deliberated over room types and ended up booking a Studio Suite. Lots of space and great views - we definitely made the right decision! Breakfast is excellent - the staff are really attentive, some of the best service I’ve seen anywhere (and we are very picky with where we choose to stay!). The food options are great - it’s a shame we didn’t stay long enough to work my way through all of the cooked breakfast options. Views from up there are also amazing! Just trying to think of an excuse to come and…"
3774,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"I write this review just to give others the hint about the restaurant experience. Let me start by saying that the hotel and spa is excellent and the hotel staff are super helpful. This review could have been so much different and it would have been a 5 star review if it wasn't for my restaurant experience. I planned the overnight stay in this hotel for my wife's birthday which included dinner in the restaurant on the 6th floor with some friends. The food was superb and the waitress was super helpful and friendly. The problem comes when we finished our desserts we were simply asked to leave the table as we had it for 2 hours already, even though we still had half a bottle of wine left to drink and no chance of ordering coffee. I asked if we could simply move to the bar then to…"
3775,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Really enjoyed this hotel. Like being on a cruise. Our room was a deluxe with a great view of the harbour. Large comfortable, sunny room. Huge bed which was a little challenge to get into. We stacked some pillows up and got used to it. I'm short... We didn't know what type of room to choose and the Deluxe was ideal for us. Bigger than the standard room and with the view. 2 arm chairs. Mini-bar (chargeable). Very quiet. There are some Deluxe rooms with a bath tub. I phoned before I booked and the staff kindly found one for me. The top floor restaurant was very good. Staff managed very well at breakfast. Such a large, sunny, airy space with lots of room to spread out, relax and enjoy the room. The staff all through the hotel were very good. Helpful and charming. Lots of…"
3776,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Arrived to be greeted by Sophie who was very friendly. Handed robes and towels and shown to changing rooms. The changing room had everything you needed including GHD driers and hair straighteners (big bonus) We went to use swimming pool but was shocked at how small it was. Only 8 loungers around the pool and all were in use. Daughter and I had a doubles massage. Nancy who I have to mention was absolutely amazing. The best full massage I’ve ever had. Felt totally relaxed afterwards. Thank you Nancy ☺️ Then we each had an individual top of the range facial. Wow! Sophie I have to say gave an outstanding facial talking me through everything she was using and what it’s benefits were. Thank you Sophie. (Will definitely be back for another one)👌 To finish the day we had Afternoon Tea…
3777,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,After confirming our reservation in February and then again 10 days prior in writing via email the hotel called less than 24 hours before arrival to inform us our reservation was no good. We had requested a room with our dog (family moving internationally). They offered no solution. No assistance and when my spouse and I each called seeking resolution we were treated dismissively and rudely. Customes should avoid this poor service and find a better option.
3778,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,The most luxurious hotel stay we’ve ever had! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel special. The staff were very attentive and wanted to make our stay as perfect as possible. The room was very spacious and had a fantastic view; the bed was comfy; everywhere was clean; we got complementary gin and snacks. The spa was everything we needed and very well kept. We had dinner and breakfast at the Jetty and Harbour on 6th and both were fantastic! Will definitely be coming again!
3779,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Lovely located hotel in local marina. Lots of restaurants and cafes and bars nearby. We stayed in a room with a large balcony which was lovely to sit on and watch all the boats. We ate at roof top restaurant and the main restaurant downstairs both meals were delicious although it is pricey! Comfy room lovely touch with free alcohol and chocolate provided in the room which was a nice touch as it was our anniversary. Lovely spa facilities which we used whilst there too. Would defo stay again.
3780,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Our trip started well managing to find a space in their barrier controlled guest car park directly opposite the hotel. It’s not immediately obvious that the main entrance is down the side of the hotel heading towards the harbour but it’s a short walk from the car park. The check in staff were welcoming and friendly. Everything looked clean both inside and out. The architecture of the buildings is very contemporary and we were pleased with our decision to take a room with a balcony. We added evening dinner to our room rate. This felt like a mistake as I definitely would not do that again. The dinner inclusive menu options are sparse to say the least and not particularly appealing to our tastes. We would like to return to the hotel but with lots of restaurants around the harbour,…"
3781,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Such an amazing experience! You definitely get what you pay for! Our family will never want to stay anywhere else again The ambience, the staff, the views, all just perfect! The Spa also has a balcony with loungers. Felt like we could have been on a sun holiday"
3782,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,A truly wonderful hotel with incredible food and staff. Would recommend the hotel and spa 100%. Restaurants and bars were lovely and the staff couldn’t do enough for us. Will definitely return as soon as we can. Thankyou.
3783,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Lovely overnight stay, our daughters arranged it as a birthday treat for my husband. The room was beautiful, view of sea, and harbour. Binoculars in room, complimentary gin. Har bar is very nice rooftop bar for drinks with a veiw and lovely outside sitting areas. Meal in the evening was delicious. Breakfast was good was great choice of freshly cooked food. All the staff from reception to cleaning staff were friendly A great stay"
3784,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Superb hotel - on the water's edge and shaped like a ship. Superbly comfortable rooms, great staff and the restaurant is first class. Nice touches like a small decanter of gin and sherry in the room, free parking, decent binoculars provided to watch the boats with and a buzzy bar. Well worth going for the breakfast option as it's a great selection of food. Will definitely be back....."
3785,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"After a long journey on the motorway it was refreshing to be welcomed by Mel the receptionist with a warm friendly smile , Mel kindly upgraded us to a studio flat , The hotel and room is spotless, staff are so friendly Every hotel needs a Mel I believe in paying for what you get , this has delivered"
3786,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Our favourite hotel never fails to impress us. The staff are genuine and welcoming the whole place has such a relaxing vibe. Rooms are spotless, views impressive and food delicious. Family friendly and accommodating, this weekend when I asked at check in for a view of the cruise ship my daughter was excited to see, they were happy to sort this for us. A very happy girl got to watch from the balcony as it left port and sailed down the Solent. Children swimming times twice a day are great. We’ve yet to try out the cinema, maybe next time. Both restaurants are fantastic. We always enjoy a lovely room service breakfast on our balcony and it’s always generous and arrives hot! In previous trips I’ve tried the spa and spa treatments and have brought family for spa days…"
3787,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Harbour on 6th is just the most amazing and brilliant place for an evening out! The food is amazing if you want to eat there and the atmosphere for just a few drinks is fantastic. The atmosphere is really set of and down to the DJ Ross E B who plays just the best tunes and give the whole place an Ibiza vibe! It’s definitely worth waiting until he comes on because honestly he is brilliant!
3788,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"From the moment we arrived, which was well before check-in time, the staff could not have done more for us. We had a lot of luggage but this was quickly collected and placed in their baggage storeroom. Despite being early, we were given a room upgrade. Special thanks must go to Tanya, Min and Rhoda in the HarBar, plus Darren and the other guys who handled our bags. We would never dream of staying anywhere else!"
3789,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"This was our 3rd bookings with the hotel. I would like to say a personal “Big Thank You” to Xiaomin Sun who has gone above and beyond to sure our stay was special and satisfied. Upon arrival, ground staff was fantastic, took care of our luggages, check-in was very friendly and attentive to ensure everything was in the right order. Room was really nice with a beautiful marina view. Dinner in Jetty and breakfast on the top floor were all great. Wonderful food with amazing service. To me, what makes a hotel standout with the 5* rating really is down to the management team and the delivery of excellent services at all levels to it’s customers. Harbour hotel has done that. Thank you again for the wonderful experience and we will be back."
3790,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Where to start ? We arrived & after being let through the barrier parked our modest family car in a marked parking space outside the hotel & we were asked to move it to the main car park:-not an issue you’d think but if you’ve a luxury car this won’t apply to you ! Our stay was a birthday treat & and an additional payment had been made to have surprise chocolates in our room upon check in -these weren’t there and only appeared after raising a complaint ! Following this went down to the Spa to relax ( which is heavily marketed by the hotel & not truthfully or accurately ) & found a small disappointing pool with only 6 sun loungers crammed in around it facing a blacked out window ! Had dinner in the evening at the restaurant on site and upon ordering a glass of wine I was…
3791,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Thank you for making our stay so special. The staff at Harbar on 6th floor especially Anau went above to make my husband birthday very special. Great food and cocktails, amazing coffee ☕. Thanks ."
3792,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Fantastic hotel, staff are amazing here and go out above and beyond, rooms are really clean and rob at the front door made the experience welcoming and so friendly. Not many hotels like this and feels like a real treat to stay here."
3793,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,The staff were friendly and helpful and the food was good but such a noisy room! The music from the 6th floor bar was insanely loud until about 1am. So disappointing and not what you expect from a high end hotel. We went as a couple for our wedding anniversary and it seems to be quite a party hotel - restaurant very loud in the evening. Great if that’s what you want but maybe something to note if you want something quieter.
3794,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"This was a birthday treat for my partner...and what treat! From the moment you arrive in the rather tastefully decoded reception are to the moment we left, nothing was too much trouble during our one night stay. We were offered a tour of the room, which we declined. In the room (with a huge balcony) is complimentary gin and sherry. I had to try the sherry for old time s sake, and it reminded me of my gran! (bless her!) The bed was absolutely massive and scores 30 out of 10 for comfort. The bathroom offered an overhead shower as well as bath, the his and hers sinks and huge balcony with loungers and a great view of the harbour. It was such a shame that the weather wasn't kind to us, as we wanted to sit out on the balcony in our Percy Pig jim jams and doing prosecco! …"
3795,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"The staff are very professional and friendly. They couldn’t do enough for us and seem to enjoy their jobs, which is always good to see. We felt very welcome. The food is great and we particularly enjoyed the rhubarb cheesecake which was so tasty (we had that twice) and beautifully presented as was all of the food. A very lovely hotel and a relaxing stay."
3796,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"Neat location, convenient for just about everywhere in Southampton. Quiet comfortable rooms with beds designed for a good night's sleep. Captivating views of the marina and port. Friendly and helpful staff from arrival to departure. It's a five-star hotel that merits the rating. Exceptionally tasty afternoon tea. As of now there's only one base for us in Southampton."
3797,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,Well what a superb hotel and staff attention to detail Magnif Alana and Angela front desk so professional and helpful and Yani who was quick off the mark to get me parked up safe and get checked in Rooms are lovely even the standard with all the amenities I will be back business or pleasure Thank you 🙏 Darren Woolley Unique Utility Solutions
3798,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"We stayed for 1 night, room was lovely, spacious, clean and well equipped. Staff all friendly and helpful. The following day we had a lovely breakfast, followed by a lovely time in the Spa, initially we was a bit concerned as there was children playing in the pool, so was thinking the relaxing atmosphere wasn't going to happen, but then read children are able to use the pool until 10.30am, after this it became very calm and peaceful; the spa is small but adequate, but the treatments more than make up for the size of the spa - there was 3 of us, each had a different therapist and each said that was the best treatment we've had so far! (We've visited a fair few spas in our time) After, we headed to the spa cafe for lunch, I had included on the booking I was gluten and dairy…"
3799,Southampton Harbour Hotel & Spa,"We had a wonderful experience here!! The restaurant on the 6th floor has a gorgeous view. Staff are extremely nice and helpful, especially Ana! We will definitely come back again. It gives us a super plus to our trip to Southampton!"
3800,The Resident Kensington,"Service was amazing, the staff was extremely helpful, professional and attentive. The location was excellent for being both quiet and clean but having close access to shops food and museums. Overall fantastic"
3801,The Resident Kensington,"Perfect location in a nice residential area close to pubs, tube and shopping. Staff was great and very helpful with recommendations when needed. Room was quiet, clean and bed was comfortable. Each night there were drinks to unwind and meet other guests."
3802,The Resident Kensington,"Hotel in a great location with friendly staff. Had easy access to transportation and within walking distance to great shopping, museums and other landmarks. Room was comfortable and had good amenities."
3803,The Resident Kensington,Thank you so much for dealing with our refund request. It is deeply appreciated. The shame for us is that we can’t stay with you this time. As the Australian government is preventing its citizens from travelling internationally we sadly had to cancel our travel plans. Your hotel has some very special memories for us on our previous trips to London and your dealing with my refund request has just added to our fine experiences with you. I’ll be remembering this when it comes time to book our London stays again. You remain our favourite London Hotel. Thanks again Mark Thomas
3804,The Resident Kensington,We spent a week ending 5/26/23 at the hotel and it was very comfortable. Staff were very considerate and always quickly responded to questions. We particularly enjoyed the kitchenette because of food allergies so we were able to eat securely.
3805,The Resident Kensington,"We had health issues that made us reschedule our trip of couple of times, and the staff were super helpful and got us changed over and booked each time. We got a King bed room and it was plenty big enough with a good size bathroom and the kitchen area was great for quick meals in the room - sink, tea kettle, coffee, dishes, glasses and the fridge is small but fit the key items we needed. I think while the room was great, it was the staff that stood out, making our stay wonderful. And the location was perfect - right on the District line to get anywhere - but also had great coffee, snacks, meals but the hotel is a block away keeping the rooms quiet in a nice residential neghborhood."
3806,The Resident Kensington,"Returning to The Resident Kensington feels a little like coming home. While the rooms are well designed and well appointed, it is the exceptional service from reception and housekeeping staff which sets this hotel apart. I was travelling with a friend with limited mobility and George and his team went out of their way to ensure our stay was comfortable and hassle-free. We also appreciated the complimentary drinks in the evening -- another way of making guests feel welcome. My only reservation is that the rooms are small: I'd recommend a standard double as a minimum. This is my third stay at the Resident, and I hope to return soon!"
3807,The Resident Kensington,"Very nice and quiet hotel near underground (5 min walk) Good size room with kettel, nespresso and fridge. Smart TV for streaming! You have restaurants, pubs, shops also just within 5 minuts walk away. We saw most of London by going with the Underground which is very easy to use - travled to/from Heathrow airport. Gets our best recommends"
3808,The Resident Kensington,"What a wonderful hotel. The facilities are first rate, beds are comfortable, great linens, the kitchenette..that I thought I wouldn't use turned out to be extremely useful. The rooms are also very well sound insulated ...I was on the street and couldn't hear a thing. Perhaps most importantly the team led by George was incredible. Endless patience, incredibly kind and always in a good mood (despite me deactivating my card or dropping off extremely heavy luggage.) I have stayed in more expensive and ""higher star"" hotels but have NEVER been treated as well. I love this place and will be back as well as recommending it to all my friends. Thank you everyone at The Residence! (And no...I don't own stock in the company.)"
3809,The Resident Kensington,I have stayed here once before and its been a great place for me to stay during solo trips. The kitchenette is really amazing especially for extended stays when I don't want to eat every meal out. It is also nicely situated near a tube station with a couple different lines which makes it very convenient to get around the city! The rooms I've stayed in are a little small but perfect for one and if you are visiting you probably aren't planning to just stay in the room. Would definitely recommend to others!
3810,The Resident Kensington,Lovely place to stay so close to Earles Court. Very quiet room with all the amenities. Staff were lovely. Each night they offered drinks near reception. Getting around London was so easy with the tube so close. Overall great place to stay.
3811,The Resident Kensington,"Easy to find, neighbourhood a little grungy, but hotel pristine, well worth the money. Quiet at night, clean and beds comfy. Staff welcoming and friendly, helpful and pleasant. Will definitely come and stay again."
3812,The Resident Kensington,"Really lovely place, very welcoming and great to connect with other staff as they organise networking drinks in the lobby. Loved the little kitchenette too, easy to bring and make your own food. Would stay again."
3813,The Resident Kensington,"This was a wonderfully classy hotel with incredibly kind and helpful staff and all the amenities we needed for a family of 4. We were pleasantly surprised with the space our room provided also! We were here during the Coronation but the staff wasn’t overly busy and had time to tend to questions, lattes and extra towels. Also the location is perfect, nestled in classy Kensington, not far from the Tube, small restaurants, and Hyde Park. If traveling further or by Uber, Kens is a convenient location also."
3814,The Resident Kensington,"It is an elegantly serviced apartment hotel, 5-min from the Earl's Court Station, located in a leafy urban neighbourhood. The staff are warm, friendly and helpful. The rooms, facilities and kitchenette are smartly furnished. It's clean, has a calm vibe with very good wifi connectivity. I came here for some me-time during the coronation weekend and will visit again. The highlight : it's affordable, tasteful and all star attractions are within easy reach to make the most of your weekend getaways in the city - for business or leisure."
3815,The Resident Kensington,"Excellent location for exploring the city. Easy walk to the underground station, Hyde Park, Natural history Museum. The staff is wonderful and the rooms are nicely appointed , clean and very comfortable."
3816,The Resident Kensington,"The hotel is situated near Earl's Court - with quick access to the Tube and many local restaurants and shops as needed. the hotel is simple, extremely quiet, with comfortable beds and spacious rooms. The rooms could be cleaned better but the customer service at the desk is impeccable. Any request we had was filled with a smile and every afternoon complimentary drinks are served. Extra thank you to Veronika from the reception! This hotel is suitable for those seeking a quite homie place, less for those looking to party."
3817,The Resident Kensington,"Was very happy with my stay - convenient for Earls Court and the in-room kitchenette was a handy addition. Plenty of things like plug sockets and a good desk to do some morning work at. Didn't eat in, so can't comment on that - but would certainly use again."
3818,The Resident Kensington,"Room was booked through a British Airways package but we were so happy with the hotel! We were especially delighted to find a king sized bed in a London hotel! The room was small but it was so helpful to have a fridge/microwave and dishes to eat/drink some meals in our room. Everything was very nice, instant hot water in the shower, great housekeeping (even made up our room when we had slept in most of the day and told them it was not necessary). Evening happy hour was a nice touch. The property is in a great location just a block from Earls Court tube station and we were able to get to anywhere we needed to go in the city, very easily. M&S Market also a block away was a great place to pick up snacks and drinks for the room. Not sure when we will get the opportunity to go…"
3819,The Resident Kensington,The Resident Kensington was absolutely fantastic. Great location to tube station and many good restaurants. The room was clean and extremely quiet. The area itself is safe and very walkable. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!! Thanks for a great stay!
3820,The Resident Kensington,"Used to stay here pre-pandemic, am so glad that in 2023 this hotel is still warm and welcoming, safe, clean, comfortable. Reception desk open 24/7, well-stocked kitchenette closet, comfortable bed and furnishings, staff pleasant and helpful."
3821,The Resident Kensington,We really enjoyed our stay at The Resident! Great location near to many dining options and the tube! The rooms were a bit small and the carpets were slightly grubby. But saw new carpet coming in as we checked out! And the bathrooms were very clean! Would stay again and would recommend!
3822,The Resident Kensington,"Quite a small house with an intimate feel, more like staying with friends than a hotel. The staff were welcoming and informative and clearly keen to make a good impression. Our room was at the back and was amazingly quiet - we woke up to the sound of a wood pigeon. Our reservations about the lack of a breakfast room were overcome by an excellent mini-kitchen in the room and an M & S food outlet nearby."
3823,The Resident Kensington,"Stayed here for 2 days during my trip to London. Amazing staff. Didn't get time to try the restaurant, but next time for sure. Kensington is such a nice area and the location of the hotel is perfect for travellers."
3824,The Resident Kensington,"We would most definitely recommend The Resident Kensington for anyone making a trip to London. The hotel was clean, and you are a short walk away from Earls Court (which goes directly to Heathrow). This neighborhood is quiet which we really liked, but if you want to experience the business of the London streets this is probably not the location for you. George the hotel Manager was incredibly friendly and went out of his way to ensure we had a great trip. We absolutely love London and would stay here again on our next trip - great hotel for a great price!"
3825,The Resident Kensington,"We had a gathering of friends in Kensington and were lucky to stumble on this hotel online. Such a lovely staff and a sweet lobby with comfortable seating and nice decor. We were so pleasantly surprised by the quiet neighborhood with easy access to great restaurants and the Earls Court tube station. The room was very comfortable, bath updated, clean, and Moulton Brown products! A kitchenette provided tea, coffee, espresso, and a refrigerator that we made use of. Daily cleaning was s bonus, as was a glass of wine in the lobby our first night. Thank you!💞"
3826,The Resident Kensington,"The staff is amazing and so kind, tending to our specific travel needs. Clean, quiet and comfortable room and cozy front desk area to sit and relax. Situated in a very nice and convenient neighborhood. We will definitely come here again!"
3827,The Resident Kensington,"I was really looking forward to this place, as it looked great online and had good reviews. Sadly, I was disappointed with the cost for a basement room and a car parking lot view. The cleanliness of the room was disgusting… soap, dirt and dust everywhere. I enjoyed the brita tap water and the location though (very close to the tube)."
3828,The Resident Kensington,Absolutely loved how close the hotel was to Earl's court (4 mins)& Glouc road(10 min) tube stations My room was well equipped with a mini kitchen and sparkling clean! :) Defo would stay here next time I'm around Kensington
3829,The Resident Kensington,"Spent two days at this very nice hotel, very near Earls' Court, in mid-April 2023. The hotel is very pleasant, and the staff are very kind and helpful. The hotel is very clean. The rooms are cosy and well-furnished. Each room has facilities to store food (a small fridge) and to heat food or drink (microwave), as well as make coffee and tea. This is very useful when travelling, as it means you can eat simple food in the room, and so you don't have to go out for a meal all the time. The hotel's location is very pleasant too, with nice clean streets, and shops and restaurants (pubs, cafés, etc.) nearby. Earl's Court underground is situated on the Piccadilly line, so it is a straigth ride to Heathrow or to St Pancras station, and also easy to get elsewhere in the centre of town.…"
3830,The Resident Kensington,"Loved our stay at the Resident Kensington, the rooms were exactly as described, the staff attentive, and the location was perfect for our outings every day. The tube is located just a couple of blocks away, there are multiple restaurants in walking distance, and a market two blocks away. The rooms were quiet as was the neighborhood. Loved this hotel and will book again if I can get back to London."
3831,The Resident Kensington,"At first it was a little rocky with check-in (3pm) and the room that was selected for us; however, Luca saved the day. He was very helpful and made sure we were able to get the room size we needed and checked to make sure we were satisfied (thank you Luca!). There is a small kitchenette in each room which was very helpful (neat and clean rooms) Near by we found an McDonald for breakfast and Nando for lunch (smile). There is also a Train station (Tube station Earl Court) about three blocks away. I recommend Paul's in Earl Court about 2/3 blocks from the hotel (great bake goods and sandwiches) and for Dr. Who fans... the blue box (Tardis) is in front of the Earl Court Tube Station. The Earl Court station is about two stops from the Victoria and Albert museum a must see and the…"
3832,The Resident Kensington,"Very nice hotel, service excellent. Room was nicely decorated and clean, linens good, bed comfortable, heated towels,responsive staff. Location near a tube station, two nearby pubs, several restaurants in walking distance. Need a placard on how to operate the lights, might be because we have not stayed in Europe before."
3833,The Resident Kensington,"Good location close to tube on a quiet street. The high price foes not include breakfast which is inconvenient. Nice in room coffee bar, microwave, fridge and dishes. Make sure you request a room NOT in the lower level (basement)."
3834,The Resident Kensington,"Although enjoying excellent communications nearby, this hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood away from the busy main high streets. The room has everything to make for a comfortable stay, it was warm, with very good lighting and storage facilities, great night's sleep, very useful kitchenette; the staff were very helpful and made me feel very welcome. I would definitely stop there again."
3835,The Resident Kensington,"The Resident Kensington was a wonderful place to stay. The room was nicely appointed and modern. It was great to have a mini kitchen with fridge, microwave and sink. The bathroom was nice with a large shower. The staff was very good and welcoming. They accommodated my early arrival and were able to get me in my room early. Viktoria was a standout staff member! The location is great with a short walk to the tube, dining, grocery store, etc. Tip: Recommend becoming a member and booking direct for discounts and early check in/ late check out."
3836,The Resident Kensington,"Well priced, compact room set up for a solo traveller but comfortable enough, despite the problem with air con. The team are the real stars of the show though, fantastic service throughout the stay where nothing was a bother."
3837,The Resident Kensington,"Great service as always, I have repeatedly stayed at this location in addition to their soho location and always get great service. Love the kitchenette in the room which is what makes me stay here. They have a nice decor which also adds to the mood. The TV in the room always has a nice section on whats going on nearby, where to eat, and more. They have a breakfast menu you can have delivered to your room and also a alcohol menu that you can order from."
3838,The Resident Kensington,Very nice rooms and clean. Staff was most helpful in getting my preferred room in which i stay at the hotel. The beds are most comfortable and the bathroom roomy. I have been staying here for the past 25 years and never disappointed.
3839,The Resident Kensington,Everything is great in this hotel. Location is perfect and it feels like home away from home:) I felt very safe. My room is always clean every time I come back. I love the kitchenette. Staff are amazing. I’m definitely coming back!
3840,The Resident Kensington,"On the plus a good location with easy access to local amenities and Earls Court tube. The room was clean, however was very cold. When booking the superior room all pics of the superior room showed the room having french doors out to a patio with seating area. The room did not have this and this was the reason we booked this hotel ahead of others. The view from the room was infact pretty dreadful. The fold out bed for our son was not great as the tv was directly above his head which meant we couldnt watch tv when he was ready for sleep. The room was ok, very basic, not the standard I was expecting and the bathroom a little tired, although the shampoo etc was nice. No one asked how our stay was and we were not informed of any breakfast so we presume there was non. It was ok but we…"
3841,The Resident Kensington,"Returned this March after pleasant stay last year. This hotel is perfect size, not too big or small, good value with membership discount. The staff is very friendly. During this stay they were a big help making suggesting's and arrangements during the tub strike. It is well run and managed and in a great location 1.5 blocks from Earls Court, waking distance to Knightsbridge , etc."
3842,The Resident Kensington,Stayed for 3 nights. Great location. Rooms basic and comfortable and met our needs and expectations. Staff on site were very pleasant. Room lacked a small table and chairs to eat breakfast as the accommodation does not have a dining room. Would stay again.
3843,The Resident Kensington,"Excellent location which is close to Earl's court station. The staffs were exceptional in every aspect. There was a mass transit strike which shutdown all underground trains on the last day of our stay, but the staffs were able to book us a private airport transfer so that we could get to Heathrow airport with plenty of time to make our flight."
3844,The Resident Kensington,"We stayed 5 days in this hotel. excellent experience. Great location. Close to everything. Small hotel, good sized room, very clean. Would definitely stay again. The staff was very polite. Good for families."
3845,The Resident Kensington,"We spent seven nights at The Resident in Kensington in early March 2023. The location is brilliant - an easy walk from Earl’s Court Station and all the major tourist sites. Upon check-in, we found the Hotel had decorated our room to acknowledge that this trip was to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary. Along with a card to mark the occasion, this was a lovely and surprising touch. The complimentary happy hour between 1800-1900 was also lovely unexpected surprise. However, our experience at The Resident was clouded by the haphazard approach of the housekeepers. During our morning shower, we found the shower wash and hair conditioner dispenser were empty. We advised Reception as we left the hotel for the day and they advised this would be passed on to housekeeping. When…"
3846,The Resident Kensington,"Rooms are small but have everything needed. Clean, comfortable, safe, cozy, and staff is friendly. Very good location. Close to the underground. Neighborhood is nice and safe. I def recommend the Resident."
3847,The Resident Kensington,"This is a nice boutique hotel in a quiet neighborhood. It’s clean and the service is good, but it has limited services and amenities. The rooms are very very small but the Internet is fast. There’s just not a great place to work if you have to work here. There is a small desk in the room, but it’s too small to really do anything, and the lobby is too loud to work in. Originally we hated the room we were in because it was on the lower level, but as it turns out it’s at the dead end of a Mews Street so it was really quiet, which was very nice, especially considering we’re in the middle of busy city. As is the case with most all hotels in London, there are no proper plugs in the bathroom - only a plug for an electric razor, so I guess if you’re a man, you’re not going to…"
3848,The Resident Kensington,"I had the pleasure of staying at The Resident Kensington for 3 periods in Feb (including an 11 night stay) on my recent trip to the UK/Europe. This hotel ticks all the boxes. Fantastic location, close to transport (Earls Court), close to all the shops on Earls Court Road and a supermarket 10 mins away (Sainsbury's). There is a local pub, 'The Blackbird' that has the best pies. I had a superior room for most of my visits and it was large, comfortable and the kitchenette was fantastic. Best of all was the staff, Edgardo, Gurpreet and the entire team, including housekeeping were just so helpful and friendly. It felt like coming home each time I would check back in after my travels. I cannot wait to return on my next trip from Australia."
3849,The Resident Kensington,"This was my second visit to The Resident Kensington. The hotel is a welcome retreat at the end of a busy day in the city. Clean, great location plus very good kitchenette facilities. I attended events at the Royal Albert Hall and in Theatreland so the location was perfect - nearby but in a quiet and residential setting without being in the hectic part of the city. Thank you - I hope to return! Would highly recommend."
3850,The Cavendish London Hotel,"The Cavendish never disappoints. Spotlessly clean. The staff are so obliging. The rooms have tea and coffee making facilities. Having a Nespresso machine in the room is the icing on the cake after a busy day shopping it’s a treat to return to the room and have a lovely coffee, biscuits followed by a wallow in a bath with White Company toiletries. When booking I made a couple of requests both of which were arranged upon arrival which I was most impressed by. The Cavendish is in a perfect position, walk out the door and there’s Fortnum and Mason as your neighbours….now that can’t be bad! I can do nothing other than HIGHLY recommend this hotel and all its staff."
3851,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Very much enjoyed staying at the Cavendish, where we’ve always stayed for over decades. Excellent location, rooms are clean but more importantly staff, at the reception and at the door and concierge, are dedicated and provide excellent service."
3852,The Cavendish London Hotel,Our stay was super comfortable and checkin was super smooth. Rooms were bit small compared to hotel rooms we get in india but it had all the inbuilt facilities. Special thanks to the front office assistant mr ayush adhvaryu for taking good care of our stay and even all the staff for making sure our stay was pleasant and memorable just for a day also… They made sure we got late checkout till i got my other hotel apartment which i had booked. The concierge staff was also kind and helpful for all our basic needs and enquiry.
3853,The Cavendish London Hotel,"I am staying for one night in the Cavendish. Excellent service. I was greeted warmly and my bag was carried to reception. After driving from Norwich to London , dropping the car and rushing across London we were a bit hot! The receptionist gave us complimentary water and directed us to our room. The classic room is spacious. Well equipped. Really comfy bed and pillows. Beautiful bathroom toiletries. A large wardrobe with full length mirrors, safe , iron , board and kettle and hospitality tray with a good selection of teas and biscuits. ! Also there is an expresso machine and large tv, I will happily return to this hotel. All the staff are lovely . I would say this is one of the best places to stay in London in a good location ."
3854,The Cavendish London Hotel,"The hotel is lovely and in a great location. The staff was friendly and helpful - especially the concierge Ahmed, who went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. I had previously stayed at the Cavendish for business, this time was just vacation. I would definitely go back."
3855,The Cavendish London Hotel,"The location of the hotel was ideal for our stay in London. It was within easy reach of attractions , transport and restaurants. The room was clean and had excellent views of the London Skyline. The staff also provided a bottle of champagne and fruit platter to celebrate my wife's birthday and our anniversary."
3856,The Cavendish London Hotel,"We stayed at the Cavendish for one week. The location is fabulous, on a quiet street right behind Fortnum and Mason. The staff was very good, eager to please and helpful. We arrived around 12:30 PM and the rooms were not ready, but we stored our bags and went for tea! Rooms were clean, we booked two standard rooms for our stay. I did go online and sign up for their program which gave me 10% off and great rates when you prepaid. The rooms were VERY small, which was fine for me because I was alone, but my couple friends were stuck with a full bed (not a queen) and very little room. I realize you are hardly there, but the bed does need to be larger! The beds were very hard and firm. I used pillows to cushion myself! There was really no where to even put the suitcases in…"
3857,The Cavendish London Hotel,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for our anniversary and had an amazing stay. We were welcomed by a spacious room on one of the higher floors, with views overlooking the centre of London — the vibrant colours of the city lights at night was my favourite sight! Our room was thoughtfully prepared, with flower petals laid nicely on the huge comfy bed, and a cold bottle of champagne on the table as a greeting for our special day. Everything was spotless and the staff were welcoming. We enjoyed the breakfast as well, the food was great. You won’t believe it’s in the centre of London as it’s tucked away from the noise of the busy streets. It was an overall hassle-free and memorable experience in The Cavendish."
3858,The Cavendish London Hotel,The Cavendish has maintained its previous high standards post COVID (unlke many of its competitors who are using this as an excuse to cutdown on guest comfort). The property still offers a warm and efficient welcome with door staff who not openly greet but relieve you of luggage - getting to be a rare thing. Reception is well manned so no delays on checking in an t he quietly efficient staff are friendily and helpful. I was delighted to receive an upgrade and my 14th floor room with wonderfull views to the north was welcoming and well equipped. High quality bedding and towels and proper toiletries. A nice touch was Sky tv rather than the usual Freeview. One of the things which reflect the hotel's service ethos was the response to requests for additional services -…
3859,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Hotel in best Location near Piccadilly Circus. Staff at Reception, Specially Reem and Anastasiia, also Hotel Service excellent, everything is clean. We will book this Summer again. Ciriaco, Zurich Switzerland"
3860,The Cavendish London Hotel,"This was the best stay I could’ve ever asked for! We came to celebrate my husband’s birthday and the staff got us a really nice room, a personal written birthday card and a bottle of Prosecco. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a nice hotel with great staff, near Piccadilly Circus and buckingham palace. 1000/10 points!"
3861,The Cavendish London Hotel,Lovely stay before my London Marathon. Stayed in 15th floor Suite room and room was spacious with bath and shower and made a difference as after marathon enjoyed a good bath before leaving. Breakfast was really good lot of choices but due to my marathon couldn’t experience other outlets. Staff very friendly and nice for shopping as it’s in Jeremyn street known for shirt makers
3862,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Really great hotel. Staff were amazing and provided a service compared to other top tier hotels. Hotel is also in a great location, in the heart of London and close to all the attractions. The room is amazing. Concierge team went above and beyond for my start, including a really memorable birthday. Would highly recommend this if you’re visiting London."
3863,The Cavendish London Hotel,"My wife and I had the most incredible experience here. The hotel is well located for shopping and theatres. As soon as we arrived the staff was pleasant and helpful, the hotel its self was very nice. Above all, the staff at the Cavendish delivered exceptional service - especially Anastasiia, who went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed. We will be back!!!"
3864,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Very good and nice hotel. Nice, clean and comfortable rooms. TV with a large range of channels, around 200. The hotel is located on Jermyn street which is a quiet street with many tailors and shoe shops and two good pubs. Its about 4 minutes to Picadilly Circus or Regent street etc. You can walk to many places such as Leicester square, Covent garden, Trafalgar square, Soho etc. Very good service and nice staff, very good breakfast. Perfect hotel for a London weekend"
3865,The Cavendish London Hotel,"I stayed at the Cavendish while in town for the London Marathon. The location is central to some the best shopping and fine dining in town. It’s also conveniently located very close to the subway. Above all, the staff at the Cavendish delivered exceptional service - especially Ahmed who went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed. I highly recommend!"
3866,The Cavendish London Hotel,"My wife and I had a London city break and chose The Cavendish London Hotel. It was in the perfect location for what we had planned. As soon as we arrived the staff was pleasant and helpful, the hotel it's self was very nice. The room was a littler than it looked in the website photographs, but was clean and comfortable. We certainly recommend the hotel to others."
3867,The Cavendish London Hotel,"My wife and I would sincerely thank you for your welcomme en Monday, April 17th and your help include Mrs Reen who has given a lot of her time to unravel the problem with the rental organization. We keep an excellent memory of our stay and will not fail to recommend your hotel to our friends. Kind regards"
3868,The Cavendish London Hotel,"I love this hotel. I hadn’t stayed there since 1984, but it is just as lovely as I remember. It is across the street from Fortnum and Mason. The location cannot be beat as it is a stones through from the best shopping in London on Regent Street. I’m very near Picadilly Circus. I was literally able to catch a bus to anywhere in London within a block of the hotel. My room was on the smaller side but had a full bath with a deep bathtub. It came with all of the amenities anyone could want. They provide a large glass bottle of water every day, coffee pods and tea at no cost. My room also came equipped with a coffee maker that takes Nespresso pods. The bed was very comfortable, but the best thing about the Cavendish is the staff. The reception desk people are so helpful and kind.…"
3869,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Excellent short stay at the Cavendish whilst visiting London for a show in the west End. The staff were first class and the hotel was ideally located off the main thoroughfares in Jermyn Street. The hotel was well appointed, clean and tidy. The room was well laid out with excellent facilities. The bed was very comfortable and we have no hesitation in recommending the Cavendish."
3870,The Cavendish London Hotel,"We stayed here for a short mid week break. The hotel is well located for shopping and theatres. Our room was a little small, but very comfortable, clean and quiet. We had a great view from our window. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Ahmed was particularly helpful and kind on our arrival and departure. Breakfast was very nice and casual. We enjoyed our stay and we would certainly stay again."
3871,The Cavendish London Hotel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Cavendish when celebrating a big birthday! We had a room upgrade and a very welcome gift. The hotel staff were very welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. The amenities, location, service and cleanliness were first class. We will definitely be staying at The Cavendish in the future."
3872,The Cavendish London Hotel,Beautiful meal in Mayfair lounge and grill. This is the second time we have visited this restaurant and each time the service from jusrat on both occasions has been first class. Food was delicious service 1st class just can't wait for the next time. Well done to this very good restaurant xxxx
3873,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Me and my husband were assisted by a lovely valet who helped us gather our bearings, gave us an umbrella and even went out of his way to find us a map, to help us get the most out of our visit. Unfortunately, when we returned to collect our car, the lady on reception was incredibly unpleasant and unhelpful. She muttered something about us not having supposed to parked where a member of staff had parked our car (we had left our keys with the hotel). Whilst doing this she continued to give us disgusting looks and ordered us to “go sit over there”, allowing us to wait, confused, for 10 minutes until my partner had to ask again if he could please be assisted in having his keys retuned. Disheartening end to his first time visiting London."
3874,The Cavendish London Hotel,"I had to see a doctor because my back when I arrived . when i returned from the doctor i had to eat something before i could take my medication even though they were not offering room service at that time they sent pastries to my room so i could take my medication.. They helped me in and out of cabs, provided a wheelchair so I would not have to stay in my room. Everyone was kind and helpful and remembered my name. As we were leaving many of the employees came to say goodbye and see if there was anything else they could do for me. The rooms were clean, quite lovely and the staff was amazing...I will stay with them again when I am in London"
3875,The Cavendish London Hotel,"I always stay at the Cavendish, great location, great rooms at a good price. The reception staff are helpful and the concierge service is first class. The bar is comfortable and the service is courteous and efficient. I’ll be back soon."
3876,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Adriana and Ayush gave us a really warm welcome to the Hotel, they have been very friendly and helpful to tend to all of our needs. The hotel is magnificent. The breakfast buffet, the room and the service are impecable and the location is perfect to walk to Picadilly Circus and Tube stations. 100% recommended!"
3877,The Cavendish London Hotel,"We booked the penthouse suite to celebrate my friends birthday. I called reception to ask if we could have a small birthday cake in the room, and Adriana and Mar assured me we would get the VIP treatment. This certainly happened from the moment we arrived, the staff took our luggage up to the penthouse, you have an extra flight of stairs as lift only goes up to 14th floor and the penthouse is on the 15th. The gentleman then opened the door and showed us around the suite. It was amazing, a truly fabulous experience. There was a complimentary fruit bowl, a very nice bottle of champagne chilling in an ice bucket and a small cake, also which was really thoughtful a hand written Birthday card with a personal message from all the staff at the hotel, these extra touches made a…"
3878,The Cavendish London Hotel,"The staff were amazing, attentive and helpful in every way. I stayed in a basic room which was really clean and had everything I needed - including a great little coffee machine. The price for a hotel located this close to Mayfair and of this standard was excellent for London. There was no compromise on the standards either - everything was excellent. I must recommend the Club sandwich which was enormous and very freshly made. Breakfast was outstanding too, a great buffet and the second day I had the a la carte breakfast which was also excellent. I liked it so much I signed up to the rewards program and will be staying again. Finally, thanks to Anastasia for being so helpful both by getting me in to my room early so I could get ready for a very important business meeting and for…"
3879,The Cavendish London Hotel,"I’ve stayed at the Cavendish so many times, and I like the hotel and its friendly service, but it sure has its downsides. I booked an entry-level room, ”Classic”, 16.8 sqm. As one can imagine, the room is incredibly cramped. There is a comfortable queen bed, perhaps 120 cm, a small closet, a desk and that’s it. No luggage rack as it would not fit. The room was clean and tidy, and in good condition even though it is quite a few years since the hotel was last renovated. No sockets by the bed, but two British three-plug sockets at the desk. Bring adapters! There is a safe, an empty fridge which you need to plug in yourself and a 0.7 L water bottle, replenished daily. There is an umbrella in every room, too, which is much appreciated. Walls are paper thin and you will hear all your…"
3880,The Cavendish London Hotel,"An amazing hotel , great location ,in the center of London ,few mins walk from Green Park all main streets. Great team that are willing to help with anything, Rooms are relatively big for London and super convinient."
3881,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Nicely decorated room, clean and cosy if not quite small. Valet parking was a nice touch. Didn't try the bar although it looked very nice and space to sit even on a Saturday night. Ahmed took good care of us as we waited for our car to be returned as we were leaving."
3882,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Reception, concierge, and service are excellent. The rooms are well-sized and the bedding is very comfortable. Great location, easy walking distance to lots of shopping, museums, theatres, and restaurants. Also quick access to multiple Tube stations if you need to go a longer distance."
3883,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Excellent Hotel very close to Piccadilly and St. James Square. Service at the top. Very comfortable. Breakfast, cleanliness and kindness significantly above the average. Very discrete location in the heart of London. Special thanks to concierge and Ahmed in particular."
3884,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Had a great time at the Cavendish during my trip to London a week ago. The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. You have Fortnum and Masons right across and you're just a few minutes away from Oxford Circus. Although the room we got was a little on the smaller side, I thought it was comfortable and clean. The staffs were always super nice and welcoming, especially Ahmed at the concierge. He made sure all our requests were met. Can't wait to stay at the Cavendish again!"
3885,The Cavendish London Hotel,I had a very pleasant stay as usual. Ahmed at concierge was particularly helpful in dealing with all my requests. The executive room was very spacious and I particularly liked the freestanding shower as well as the fact that a bottle of water is provided every day. There was also an umbrella at hand which was very helpful. Ahmed at concierge was particularly helpful in dealing with all my various requests.
3886,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Excellent service and attention to customers, I was impressed, Bravo Reem and Anastasiia, for your extra mile, You made me feel most welcome and you have quickly fixed the issue I had with the first room. Keep it up Cavendish Team! See you soon again, Best, Tony Richard"
3887,The Cavendish London Hotel,"The Staff are second to none - nothing is too much trouble and everything is done quickly, efficiently and with a smile ! - In particular I would like to single out the concierge service for special praise - we were in London this Wednesday when the city virtually came to a standstill due to the underground being on strike,and teachers and other having mass demonstrations in support of their pay dispute. We were due to a theatre show at 7.30pm and by 6.00pm it became apparent the roads were totally gridlocked - Ahmed (concierge) took it upon himself during his ‘time off’ break to accompany my wife and I, - on foot and in the pouring rain ! - most of the way (45 minutes) to the theatre using short cuts though the side roads. This was above and beyond ‘the call of duty’ - Thank…"
3888,The Cavendish London Hotel,Our fifth time staying at this hotel. Wonderful location but sadly standards have slipped since covid. No vegetarian sausage on breakfast buffet. Ordered fried eggs but they didn’t arrive within our 45 minutes there. The next morning the porridge didn’t arrive. The bar didn’t sell Guiness for my partner. Not good enough for a hotel with this many stars. Shame because we used to love staying here
3889,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Took family for a 2 night stay for a little trip to Londinium! Great service from all staff, lovely accommodation and a top stay as always. I would suggest people try the restaurant for an evening meal - exceeded expectations. Lovely location of hotel across the road from F&M and short walk to Hyde Park, Piccadilly, Buckingham Palace etc."
3890,The Cavendish London Hotel,The location is excellent close to Piccadilly Circus and and the tourist attraction. The front office staff were really friendly . I was really happy to see the hotel when out of the way to place a cake and some chocolates in the room when I mentioned over conversation with the receptionist it was our anniversary. Excellent view from the room over looking the London eye. Will definitely visit again .
3891,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Travelling to central London, no better place than the cavendish. Clean rooms pleasant staff and great service throughout. Breakfast has good selection as well. Nothing seemed difficult for the team..one of the best places to stay,Will definitely return back!"
3892,The Cavendish London Hotel,"So I am writing this after spending a weekend here and a weekend right in Covent Garden. I have to say, I will return to Covent Garden the next time simply because the location is incredible. All the restaurants etc on your doorstep. We loved it. Having said that, the Cavendish is in a quieter (more peaceful) and probably more upmarket area. Jermyn street is quiet at night and the hotel has easy access to everything around it (Mayfair, Hyde Park Knightsbridge, the Palace, Kings Road area, Covent Garden etc) London is so expensive for hotels in my opinion. you will definitely pay £1000 for 3 nights in a 4 star in a good area like this. So if that sounds pricey to you, make sure you shop around. I always do... this is about as reasonable as it gets for this standard of hotel in…"
3893,The Cavendish London Hotel,"It has been warm and pleasant feeling since I arrived at the hotel. The receptionist are very friendly. The concierge Ahmed was also very accomodating to all of my questions. It has been great stay, near to office, near to Picadilly circle and st James square. All within walking distance which is great. Thank you!"
3894,The Cavendish London Hotel,"From the second that we walked into the hotel lobby (and received an extremely warm greeting and bottles of water from Concierge Ahmed, who immediately took rusksacks from our shoulders - what a gem) we knew we'd chosen a great hotel. I'd asked for a room on a higher floor, as we were celebrating my husband's birthday and I was hoping for an amazing view over London. Well, we weren't disappointed. The view from our 12th floor was truly awesome. The hotel had also gone 'over and above' my decorating our bed and providing complimentary champagne and chocolates. I was in tears at such a beautiful and unexpected gesture. This magnificent hotel just could not have done any more for us... we were over the moon with our experience. Thank you so much to everyone who made our…"
3895,The Cavendish London Hotel,"We had a lovely stay at the Cavendish, the staff is very welcoming. Neat and clean rooms. Perfectly located to reach the best places around. Hop Skip Jump, and you have Fortnum Mason right there. Overall, we had a wonderful stay. Thank you, the Cavendish London"
3896,The Cavendish London Hotel,"We loved our stay at cavendish hotel London, the staff were so great and caring. Ahmed in the lobby we’re especially great, he took care of our bags and was really kind. He kept track of our taxi when leaving and carried our bags to the taxi. Will return to this hotel."
3897,The Cavendish London Hotel,Perfect location for easy access to our office. I would visit again. Room was clean and comfy. Staff at desk was helpful with my questions. Breakfast was nice and tasty with a good selection. Overall vert pleased with my short stay.
3898,The Cavendish London Hotel,"Nice smart hotel with friendly staff. Ideally located for Mayfair, Piccadilly. St James park etc. Rooms nice and clean. Breakfast was ok but perhaps a little average. Buffett style and would not be worth an extra payment but was bundled in with our room rate so was ok."
3899,The Cavendish London Hotel,The hotel is situated in an Excellent location . Walking distance to the city centre. It was also very convenient as it is a 5 min walk to my meetings. The reception staff Melika and Valerie were very pleasant and professional . Loved my stay at the Cavendish.
3900,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Great location, 3 mins walk from King's Cross subway & HOP-ON, HOP OFF! buses (great for an early tour before the traffic gets totally jammed), close to ""HP shop at Platform 9 3/4 "", close to British Museum... close to everything. Not my first stay in a central London hotel, but this was by far the largest and cleanest room. Seamless check in, fantastic beds, good breakfast. I will absolutely remember this place for next time."
3901,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,The staff were so lovely and kind to us. The lady on reception went above and beyond to help us enjoy our stay being very kind to my autistic teen daughter . The hotel was very quiet and we slept well .
3902,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Functional. Clean. Close to London St Pancras. Absent air conditioning in room. Room temperature easily mid -20s’C. Uncomfortable for sleep. I would not book again unless I absolutely had to for proximity and economy. This was an endurance test.
3903,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Hotel is OK. Picked it due to being besides the railway station. Restaurant food was nice. The let down was the rooms. Cleanliness ain't great! I'm a head housekeeper so I know my stuff. The bed was comfy and the room is fit to purpose as I would expect in a budget hotel.
3904,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Hotel is in a great location. The hotel rooms are ok but the negative thing is there is no ventilation, AC doesn’t work and the rooms all have a bad smell. For the money we paid, I would definitely stay somewhere else. We ended up getting a fan for the last night. Front desk at checkout asked how the stay was and I told him about the air quality in the room and he just didn’t care. I would definitely look elsewhere before booking here."
3905,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Great location by the Kings Cross rail station. The beds were comfortable. We did not eat there but the coffee shop attached to the hotel was excellent.There are restaurants on the street that are good if you are looking for a quick meal.
3906,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"The room wasn't as clean as normal. Booked for 2 people but received 1 set of towels. The air con made a buzzing noise all night long and no air came out of it. The unit looked dated. The noise from above was like they were in the same room as me. Most of this occurred through the night. Terrible night sleep due to noise levels, air conditioning unit that was advertised but didnt work. At check out, no one available. I filled a form online and asked for a refund for my stay but this was denied as I didn't contact the hotel at 1st point, so was expected in the middle of the night to go to reception to resolve this, can an employee fix this for me, no. I expected better from Premier Inn and been left disappointing from this stay and then to get no where with the guest relations…"
3907,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"My husband and I stayed for one night (8 June). The reception team were unprofessional and didn't seem to know how to handle the computerised key cards. Check in took a long time with seemingly no concern on their part. The receptionist made a joke at my husband's expense which I found highly inappropriate. The room we were given smelled of drains and one of the pale green chairs had a brown stain on the seat which looked like excrement. We asked for a change of room and (after a struggle) eventually were given one. When we asked why none of the bedroom windows opened, we were cheerily told it was down to suicide prevention. The hotel was tired, grubby, airless and poor managed. We would never, ever wish to visit this place again."
3908,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Great location close to train/tube, clean room, lovely food, we had breakfast and evening meal, nothing was too much trouble, great nights sleep, quiet areas, plenty of lifts, didnt have to wait long at all. Nothing was too much trouble for staff."
3909,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Just wanted to leave a review for the friendly staff, in particular Gosia - she was so helpful to us all and was so friendly to us and our daughter- she went above and beyond for us and we are so grateful :)"
3910,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"The Staff are very polite. The Room is incredibly hot, aircon is restricted. Wi-Fi does not work in room. Curtains do no block light properly. Exhaust in bathroom incredibly loud. Overall, arrived with the hope to be rested, ended up more tired than before."
3911,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"The price for this Hotel does not correspond to the quality offered. The mattress was really really bad. The bathroom’s mirror was really small and in a furniture outstanding the wall, and you couldn’t use the sink. The bathroom was really small, and you only have a hand towel per room. There are no bathroom amenities. The Hotel entrance is really small, it seems like a house entrance. The only thing that is worth it is the location. The hotel quality is not good."
3912,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,They booked someone else in our room shortly after we checked in so she walked in our room. They charged us twice. Air conditioning broken.So hot you couldn't sleep. TV broken. No fridge. Don't stay here if you can avoid it.
3913,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Due to a severely delayed train I needed to find a hotel in London for an overnight stay. I was unable to book via the website as it kept failing before the booking was confirmed so I had to book in person at Reception which meant that the room was over £100 more than if I had booked online. There was no facility at the hotel to book online to reduce the price.
3914,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"The rooms are clean and bigger than I expected. The breakfast was delicious! RINOA at the breakfast buffet was so nice! She welcomed us warmly when we arrived and found us a table immediately. Then she helped me find decaf coffee and cream. She was so pleasant and helpful and she went out of her way to ensure that I had a wonderful breakfast experience. The location was ideal for us as King's Cross is one of the most central places to stay in London with access to transportation that goes everywhere. The hotel is right around the corner from the station which is super convenient! The rooms can't be cooled below 19C, which is too hot for us to sleep, even in the winter. The toilet paper in the room is disgraceful! SHOCKING! Like I'm at a public toilet in the middle of…"
3915,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Room 333 is supposed to be one of the Premier Plus rooms. It is really small and not worth the extra money. On my last day there was no hot breakfast and I had to ask for a refund. A member of staff tried to enter my room at 8.30 on the last morning, even though I had not checked out and was still using it. Absolutely poor."
3916,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Premier Inn is a consistent brand that provides no frills but everything one needs. Bedroom and bathroom are well organised and comfortable. Everything works. This hotel has good public spaces and a pleasant bar/restaurant. Conveniently placed for station, tube and buses."
3917,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Our room was OK - clean, but very basic. Shower/bathroom were good. We had trouble getting service to empty our trash. We were there in May and temperatures outside were pleasant but the room was dreadfully warm, with no effective way to control the temperature. There's no coffee maker or mini-fridge in the room."
3918,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Absolutely incredible, location is wonderful and the hotel is fabulous. I had stayed at Leicester Square and it was pretty bad, staff were lovely but that was about it. So I was expecting more of the same. Well it totally blew me away, great hotel, love the foyer. The food in the restaurant is wonderful, I booked a meals package and this was important as the food at Leicester Square was inedible. The staff in both the hotel and the restaurant at Kings Cross are amazing. All up we had a fabulous stay and I really wish it was longer. I loved London staying at this hotel. My previous experience at Leicester square I didn’t enjoy London at all. We stayed at Keswick, Salisbury, Leicester Square and Kings Cross. Kings Cross was the pick of them all and next time I’m in London I’ll be…"
3919,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Yet another great Premier Inn. This one is particularly marvelous because of its location so close to Kings Cross Station. We felt so connected to London and could get anywhere we wanted by train or bus only a few short minutes walk from the hotel. It is so well-located and the quality of the rooms, breakfast, etc., is just as high as most Premier Inns we have stayed in."
3920,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Vastly overpriced and not that great. Rooms far too hot as AC is useless and windows can't be opened. Asked for room to be cleaned after 3rd night but arrived back at 10pm and it wasn't done due to lack of staff. Asked reception for new towels which they said would be delivered in 5 minutes but they never appeared. Usual Whitbread charge the earth but provide a very poor experience. I'm done with Premier Inn.
3921,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"I stayed for 2 nights at the not inconsiderable cost of nearly GBP500. The location was perfect for London Kings Cross and the lobby inviting. I stayed in a Premier Plus room. The room was so tiny I could barely get my (small) case past the bed. I think I was unlucky as walking past the other rooms on the premier plus floor while they were being cleaned they seemed much larger. The TV didn't work, the fridge was leaking and the wi-fi code stopped working. Reception helped out with a new wi-fi code after several minutes of back and forth explaining that I could absolutely confirm that I didn't have 3 devices connected, luckily I took screenshots. The bathroom was great with a good shower and toiletries. Considering its location there wasn't much noise from outside. The…"
3922,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Customer services after check out is extremely poor. Unfortunately, i forgot my electric toothbrush in my room in this hotel. I live in Manchester and travelled back after checking out on 4th May 2023. Since then I have been calling them on their number many times but no one pick sup. When I emailed the customer services they directed me to the same phone number for Premier Inn Kings Cross that nobody picks up. It was an expensive electric toothbrush and it appears I am £100 out of pocket due to poor customer service :-( Booking Refernce: BCRR451092"
3923,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"A great place to relax after a busy day of touring London. The proximity to King's Cross station was perfect for those who aren't driving around. We had breakfast 1 of the mornings, and it was worth the money."
3924,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Very pleased with hotel overall. Room was clean and spacious. Bathroom was great. Queen bed no king. Quiet and secure. Breakfast was great. Get the ultimate or upgrade for $2. Was not a fan of the small plates on menu. Hamburger and wings were very good. Bartenders were lacking. Bourbon and coke no ice and margarita served in Martini glass. Stick to beer. There are numerous Premier hotels in the area. Ensure you're comparing apples to apples. Would stay again.
3925,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"I always try book a Premier Inn as you know what you are going to get. However, on this occasion we only need the room to shower as we were doing a charity walk of 26 miles starting at midnight and needed somewhere to shower after. The PI's are perfect for this."
3926,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"On attempting to book in on an auto machine which was not working a manager shouted rudely "" Go over there!"" pointing at the booking in staff. Not a nice start. Our room was on the ground floor at the rear of the building. It had no view and a frosted window. It was close to staff entry and exits. We were woken up at 5.40 all three mornings by people using these doors noisily and talking. It sounded like they were putting rubbish an bottles in the bins. One morning it sounded like the bins were being emptied. You could also hear the sound of trolleys rattling as the were being moved. The cooked breakfast was hardly warm all three mornings, particularly the bacon and sausage. Although it was under a hot lamp the hot plate was not working. The bar in the evening was busy but it…"
3927,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"We've had a few stats at hotels recently that cost about the same or more, and have been really disappointed by the quality of the place or the noise level. With Premier inn you nnow what uou are getting and its good value for money"
3928,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"One towel for two, poor wifi connection, plugs not powerful at all to charge iPhone or others devices, room too hot even with the airco at 19 degrees (and window could not even been opened in tilt-and-turn”. Breakfast was supposed to be until 10.30 am and they didn’t refill product at 09.00 am … so if you come after 09.00 am, you have nearly nothing left !"
3929,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Check in at the available terminals was easy. Our room, No. 17 on the ground floor was a nice size, bedding was awesome and we really enjoyed not having to stand in the bath to shower. Staff were very helpful and we only needed to check out by 11am. Breakfast, full English, had to be the best I have ever had in London. I am switching my loyalty from another hotel group and have re-booked this hotel for 19 June 2023."
3930,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Easy to find all kinds of transport options from this hotel location near Kings Cross. Even the Premier Plus room I booked was smallish, with very limited space and storage. The hotel claims to offer 24 hour Reception,but at times it was impossible to find someone at the desk. The included Full Breakfast we opted for was convenient but just so-so; the exact same items offered daily. Overall a fair value."
3931,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Do not stay here. It was possibly the worst hotel I have stayed in for very many years. The location is perfect if you need to be in Kings Cross, which I did for an early train the next morning and I was shocked to see the appearance of the outside of the building and the state of the bedrooms, which reminded me of being in a cheap airport hotel, 25 years ago. I have travelled all over the world and I would say this was definitely the worst hotel I have stayed in for a long time. Also, because I needed a flexible rate, it was very expensive. We paid over £10 for breakfast per head and although there was plenty of choice, the quality of the food was absolutely disgusting. I very rarely leave reviews on any website unless it is good because I don’t particularly like leaving…"
3932,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"This hotel is excellently located right next to Kings Cross station with great underground, overground and bus links. We stayed in a room with 2 small children and it was spacious, clean and comfortable and the hotel breakfasts the next morning were excellent, I'd definitely book here again as a base to explore London!"
3933,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Facilities were standard premier inn however staff appeared to be a shortage of! As mentioned before a/c only goes to 19 which is too hot. Also why does the costa close at 4pm on a Saturday!!!!!!!!! Went to vending machine but that only had water and Fanta orange, so took our money elsewhere"
3934,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,The air conditioning thermostat would only go down to 19c which is very warm for sleeping.. and the window would not open but did get a fan for the room but it was still too warm. The staff were excellent could not have asked for better.
3935,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"We’ve stayed here many times now . It’s always consistently good . The welcome , the room, the location and great food is all you want on a busy weekend in London. Will definitely return because it’s always such great value for money"
3936,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,We stayed one night allowing us to visit attractions and eat in a restaurant I wanted to try. So this was just a room for one night. It met all the criteria it advertises. We didn't have breakfast. For a basic room its good for the price paid. It's only a few minutes walk from King's Cross mainline station.
3937,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Before we left Australia, the Premier Inn website advices you can apply for an early booking, just contact them to arrange. Trouble is this hotel doesn't supply an email address, only a phone number and postal address. After multiple phone calls I couldn't get through so I sent a letter, explaining that we'd be be happy to pay the 10 pound extra, and say 9 am would be okay. They did respond via email to my letter, but said all they would do is their best and it'd be up to the cleaning staff to agree. We'd paid in advance for a two night stay, but when we arrived, the two female receptionists said this was a breach of our contract so we had to pay another fee which was over 100 pounds. After much protesting, we paid, but our anger prompted the receptionists to say that their…"
3938,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Very enjoyable stay at Premier Inn London King’s Cross! Great location, very polite & helpful staff. Excellent food with great choice for breakfast + dinner. Prices were very good. Only issue was high temperature during the night in the room."
3939,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Staff were rude, to us and other guest as the hotel we whiteness. No house keeping the whole 5 days I stayed even tho I asked the receptionist. Hotel is very loud, got a really poor sleep, very expensive for the quality of services we got. Even after speaking to staff about issues with room and no house keeping they could not resolve this"
3940,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Easy to check in. Comfortable room. Nice bathroom. Location of hotel for train station was excellent. Restaurant was ok - but found the portion sizes small for the price. Would like larger amounts of food, although the quality was very good."
3941,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"The location of this hotel was perfect as we arrived into Kings Cross on Saturday lunchtime ready for the marathon on Sunday morning. We needed to leave at 7:30 to get to my marathon start, we had booked breakfast at 7am and were a few minutes early. We sat down at an empty table as there was no one around. The breakfast staff were so rude and told us repeatedly the restaurant didn’t open until 7am. We were quite happy to sit and wait but they seemed annoyed that we did not leave our table and stand up where a queue was now starting to form. When a member of staff came over to take our room number he was rude and again said we were too early!!! When I asked for porridge (which was on the menu) it took 15 minutes to arrive as it was made to order….. On London Marathon morning,…"
3942,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"I had a brilliant stay here area is perfect if you want out of city but still able to access it with the underground’s, bedrooms are very spacious and clean and bathroom facilities were perfect! Definitely recommend"
3943,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Room 20 on ground floor was adjacent to the restaurant customer toilets. Obvious plumbing/sewage problem as the corridor and our room stunk of raw sewage for the 2 night stay. Finally got a room change for the second night, buy stay had already been ruined. First night terrible sleep with the stench. No apology given despite the receptionist agreeing it stuck."
3944,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Having stayed at another low-cost hotel previously, I was expecting this to be of the same standard. I was surprised and pleased that the room was better than what I expected. The check in was easy, there’s a restaurant and bar downstairs as well as a coffee place which made the stay even more convenient. The location was ideal as it is very close to the train station. Overall, a very pleasant overnight stay."
3945,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Terrible place. Staff rude and patronising, no dairy alternative for breakfast during some of the stay, room wasn't cleaned when requested in person at the front desk, poor choice for continental breakfast. Cleanliness of the breakfast room severely lacking. Not worth the price at all."
3946,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"Fairly quiet hotel, respectful clientele, nice staff.Comfortable beds and pillows, important for us. A little cramped in the room (family of 4) fine for 3 days. Restaurant a little pricey but normal for centre of London, I suppose...We chose the cheaper meals..Very busy in the evenings, best to reserve in advance!"
3947,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"We only stayed one night before we left the UK and only needed a place to sleep. However, this hotel was excellent. It was clean and comfortable, the room was spacious, the staff friendly and great food at the restaurant. It far exceeded our expectations."
3948,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,"I've booked this hotel because of its proximity to the Eurostar station and that I needeed a room for 4. I was not dispointed. You can catch your train in less than 10 minutes, the personnel is friendly, available. Room was clean and fit my expectation. The cooked breafast is great and free for the kids and they were delighted :) Some flaws : - Wi-fi was quite slow - I couldn't cast my tablet to the TV - I asked to empty the trash can with no need to clean the room but this was not been done But the we all enjoy our stay and will definitively come back!"
3949,Premier Inn London King's Cross Hotel,Les then a minute kingscross station! Rooms are comfortable and plenty of space.. Bathrooms are a decent size. Beds are really comfortable.. didn’t eat at hotel but the food looked nice. Would stay again next time return to london
3950,The Swan Hotel,"We organised a family party in the Courtyard Bar to celebrate a 70th birthday, we had over 30 guests. The buffet was amazing and everyone commented on how good it was. The staff looking after us on the day were so very helpful especially Jason the deputy manager and Carla. Would highly recommend The Swan and would definitely book them again"
3951,The Swan Hotel,Amazing stay - great sleep quality. Room we had was on top floor overlooking the high street but quiet - only minor issue was the floor is a little ‘wonky’ this causing a minor issue of shower pooling. But a great stay. All the staff are very helpful and friendly - especially Jason who was super informative regarding the area - loved the little touch of the hand written note beside the bed 👍🏻. Car park is fabulous also may I add along with the largest breakfast a man could eat. Fab
3952,The Swan Hotel,"Wife and I stayed a night in Stafford to catch an old friend. The Swan was perfect! Old world charm with modern amenities. Stayed in room 205. Room was very clean and well appointed. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Clean and spacious bathroom. Dinner was excellent, menu had a few of the old standards as well as some more modern options. Breakfast menu was great too. All staff we encountered we cheery and friendly. Will stay again."
3953,The Swan Hotel,"We stopped to break up a journey. Room was comfortable, food in the restaurant was very good. Included breakfast was excellent. Enjoyed the historical atmosphere.Staff was helpful, when we arrived early stored our luggage with no hassle."
3954,The Swan Hotel,We were looking forward to a relaxing and spoiling stay after a five hour drive from Scotland but our experience was far from it. Although the room was spacious the difficulty in opening windows was challenging but when the Friday night live music started we began to understand why most windows were sealed! Apparently every Friday is music night for the locals but we were not warned. Our room was one designed for the handicapped and wheel chair access and I doubt they would be able to stand on a chair and open a window. The food was poor - fish & chips was probably the worst we have ever tasted. We tried to buy a bottle of still water for our room but the hotel had no water except sparkling. We were told to go to the local shops. Certainly not a repeatable experience
3955,The Swan Hotel,"This hotel is in a great spot in the centre of Stafford. It is opposite St Chad's church, a beautiful late Norman building with amazing carvings. The Swan also has an extensive history and is set in a street with several other old buildings including High House. The hotel has great ambiance with a beer garden and lots of seating for guests. Staff are brilliant and cannot do enough for you. The room was spacious and comfortable. One thing worth mentioning is in finding the hotel which we found tricky. Google maps sent us down the wrong roads to access parking. We eventually found it by entering ""Greengate Street"" in the search."
3956,The Swan Hotel,"We enjoyed our stay here. Our room was top notch being comfortable and spacious. The decor is interesting and the hotel is large with a number of drinking and dining areas. Finding the hotel parking is difficult and we had a couple of failed attempts. We didn’t dine at the hotel in the evening, we were told at reception that they were ranked number 1 on Trip Advisor - alas not for food. We did have a couple of drinks before stepping out and the bar was busy and understaffed. There was an excellent pint of Green Duck Brewery Swan Blonde on offer. Breakfast was top quality. The hotel is centrally located and there lots to see and do including good access to shops. There was some noise from the front entrance f the hotel. We thought overall it was good value."
3957,The Swan Hotel,"The hotel is centrally located on the High Street in Stafford . The rooms were spotless and comfortable with good facilities , The staff were really friendly and couldn’t do enough to help . Breakfast was outstanding , cooked fresh to order and plenty of it. We had dinner in the restaurant twice and the food was really lovely . There is a lovely courtyard to sit in and we took advantage of the good weather and had drinks there on the evening . The only thing I would say is there was live music on there on the Friday night . We were advised of this though and it was finished at 11pm prompt which was fine . Also the hotel is very near a lovely old church, however the chimes do start at 8am so just something else to be aware of if you don’t like any noise at all . I wouldn’t…"
3958,The Swan Hotel,Check in was sorted quickly and with friendly cordiality. The meals were great (The full English breakfast was brilliant!) All the staff were very friendly and ready to cater for your needs. A big thank you to Amberle Dickson the really chatty little waitress in the dining room. She made very welcome and is a mine of information about the Hotel and things to do and events in Stafford.
3959,The Swan Hotel,"Perfect location for easy access to Stafford Town Centre, Town Park, Train Station etc. Very friendly and welcoming staff, comfortable surroundings and interesting historic building. Food pretty good."
3960,The Swan Hotel,"Friendly, clean, comfortable, homely, accessible, quirky, central, truly dog friendly ! These are just a few of the words we used to describe The Swan Hotel in Stafford. Just a short drive off the M6 we we had reached the car park in no time ! We had the warmest welcome from Jason who had everything ready, check in was super quick and easy. Our dog was very happy to find a comfy dog bed and water bowl set up in our room ! We had booked for dinner and had a lovely window table set aside for us to eat with our dog. Lewis was our waiter for the evening and ensured that we had everything we needed, the food was lovely and there was a lovely atmosphere in the bars and brasserie in the evening. After a very comfortable night we arrived for breakfast again with our dog and had a very…"
3961,The Swan Hotel,"The Swan Hotel looks impressive on the outside and does not disappoint on entering. The reception staff were very plansanr, efficient and helpful.The room was well appointed, light and spacious. Toiletries of good quality. I did not have dinner but breakfast was first class with very good service. Icould not have been happier. Have stayed here before and would not wish to stay anywhere else when I visit Stafford."
3962,The Swan Hotel,"Hired the rear lounge and bar for a family birthday party , the supplied buffet was excellent and well catered for those with dietary needs. We were very well looked after by Jason the manager and other staff, nothing was too much for them and we all had a very good time. I would thoroughly recommend them for a special event."
3963,The Swan Hotel,"The setting is lovely, good ambience and staff pleasant. Not keen on some if the twee decor, such as hideous paintings of humans with duck heads, and saucepans hanging in the skylight! But disappointing that they had none of the wines we usually have off the menu, no picpoul, no Albariño, which is one reason we go there. And by 7pm we couldn’t order a latte for some reason. And it’s one of those places that is card only which is not considerate of customer choice to use cash. Big business pushing for cashless society to make life easier for themselves and using covid as a reason no doubt."
3964,The Swan Hotel,"I went for a cream tea in the coffee bar in the swan today, the service by Luke was the best service I've ever been provided as a customer. He went out of his way to help us, offer us advice and all with a smile. He even overheard us asking each other about the local bands playing and found us a leaflet to read. The tea and scone were divine also. I will definitely be going back again soon ☺️"
3965,The Swan Hotel,"We booked 2 nights at The Swan as we were visiting Stafford for The Stalking Show at the County Showground which is about 10-15minutes drive away. From the moment we arrived we were treated with the utmost care by all the staff. The rooms were clean, and well equipped and ours was very quiet. The bed was also very comfortable. We booked on a Bed & Breakfast basis then added on dinner for both nights which we didn’t regret. The food was excellent with a varied, well cooked selection and the service was excellent. All the waiting staff both at breakfast and dinner were friendly, efficient which really impressed us!"
3966,The Swan Hotel,It was lovely to be back at The Swan and to experience a large four poster bed at last. The breakfast and evening restaurant menu is a particularly strong feature of the hotel and its ancient internal lane of bars and coffee areas. Table cloths would be nice in the evening on some tables perhaps and would stop the habit of spray cleaning tables next to diners (always spray into the cloth and then apply!) Staff are really friendly and helpful. Sadly the pedestrianised street outside can be noisy at night - perhaps because it was bank holiday Easter it was worse than usual. Not the hotel’s fault!
3967,The Swan Hotel,"From the outside, we were reluctant to go in, but there were not many places to eat in Stafford from what we saw (we are not local), so felt we had little choice. We looked at the menu window and decided to try. Wow, it was lovely inside when we opened the door. Totally different to the look from outside. Sat in the window of the coffee area. Had a chicken club sandwich. It was fresh and delicious! The fat chips were amazing. I can't fault it. Had a coffee after and it came with 3 malteasers. I won't go to Stafford again, as the shopping is terrible, but we found a gem in the rough at The Swan. Beautiful."
3968,The Swan Hotel,"We stayed here for one night during our travels. The hotel is located right on the main pedestrian street in Stafford, and luckily for us, they had plenty of free parking in their lot behind the hotel. It's a little tricky to find the lot (but look for the small sign for the Swan on the left side of the street before your turn in). We had a room on the second floor. It was quite large, with windows overlooking the pedestrian street below. The furniture was a bit dated, but everything was very, very clean. We opted to have dinner at the hotel and were pleased with the variety of selections. The wait staff was very friendly, and were super accommodating to our schedule -- since we had to eat quick, and run off to a football game. The next morning we had the included…"
3969,The Swan Hotel,We had a wonderful time. The room including 4 poster was very well appointed. Freshly cooked breakfast was delicious. The bar area was useful for meeting friends. Checking in and out was seamless. Thank you again to all the friendly staff
3970,The Swan Hotel,"Decided to drop in for a quick meal.. sadly service was extremely slow being a waitress myself and we work at a very quick fast pace in a bigger restaurant, I couldn't understand why the team was working so slow. On the plus side waitress was lovely.. drinks took ages for some reason and thats before even ordering our food.. sadly unruly children swearing outside. Can't be helped sadly. Food was OK... sadly pork belly well over cooked. Lovely calm atmosphere though. Overall mixed feelings if I would return. Waitress has a lovely manner about her definitely a plus side to your business."
3971,The Swan Hotel,excellent stay with great food and staff the cleanliness the actual hotel is one of the most pleasant we have stayed in with different areas for food exct including its own coffee shop al made for a great couple of days
3972,The Swan Hotel,We took advantage of a winter offer to take a break in Stafford on the way to the Lake District. Great hotel with excellent bedroom and superb dinner and breakfast included. Free town centre parking Highly recommended place to stay
3973,The Swan Hotel,"We accidentally found the Coaching Group hotels while visiting England a few weeks ago. We stayed in the one in Bakewell and it was so nice, we decided to find another on our route, which led us to The Swan. The Swan certainly did not disappoint. The room was well-appointed, the facilities were clean and well-decorated, and the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable and feel appreciated. We would definitely recommend these hotels to our friends and will book when we are in the UK."
3974,The Swan Hotel,"A wonderfully renovated hotel that has been standing for over 500 years, with spacious rooms and an extremely comfy bed. English breakfast was included in the package and was one of the best we've tasted. Also, a great place to eat lunch or dinner with nooks and crannies adding to the traditional ambience of an historic buildng (but you need to book in advance). I timed it and it's only 8 minutes from the station, across a picturesque park with small bridges over the River Sow."
3975,The Swan Hotel,Overall good. Some of staff rude. Was told not to book dinner on Sunday. When we arrived it was booked out.had to go elsewhere. Would star again.breakfast was top quality and service was very good. Thanks
3976,The Swan Hotel,Lovely hotel in the centre of town with own free car park. The room was well appointed with extra treats on the hospitality front. Lovely toiletries and towels in the bathroom. Breakfast good and promptly served. A nice stay and excellent value for the deal that we secured. Thank you.
3977,The Swan Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights on a TZoo deal with B+B and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The old and historic hotel has been renovated to a high standard and most of the staff were very welcoming. In particular, Becca who was serving in the restaurant was excellent."
3978,The Swan Hotel,"We arrived late to our dinner bed and breakfast and had been in contact almost daily by email by the hotel to arrange dinner times etc. unfortunately we had a minor medical situation which required a visit to A &E in Stafford and liased with management regarding our late arrival. Christopher couldn’t be more helpful, he changed our dinner booking without a problem. After dinner he delivered a huge bag of ice wrapped in a bag and clingfilm for icing the injured ankle which was above and beyond his remit . The food I. The restaurant was very good and the breakfast fantastic . Will recommend if visiting the centre of Stafford . The car park is a bit tricky to find be aware ."
3979,The Swan Hotel,"Enjoyed the stay, staff very friendly, room was spacious and comfortable. The deal we booked was excellent value which included a 3 course meal each, the duck I had melted in the mouth. Breakfast was pretty impressive too!"
3980,The Swan Hotel,"First ever visit to Stafford, for a Sunday workshop with Mister Finch Textiles, who had recommended The Swan Hotel. Booked directly via hotel website, where there was a Winter Offer package which included breakfast. Booked a single room which on arrival/Check-In had been upgraded to a 'Classic Double'. Room, Sunday evening Dinner (Mother's Day so restaurant had been very busy all day) and Monday breakfast were all excellent. A very favourable introduction to Stafford!"
3981,The Swan Hotel,"The hotel, it's staff, cleanliness and food were excellent. The hotel has a very nice feeling inside with attractive quirky decor and is very popular. Close to historical buildings. We would visit again if in the area"
3982,The Swan Hotel,"Stayed with the TravelZoo offer for two nights so got a good price. Room was a good size but with a pokey window overlooking roofs. Bathroom okay but far too hot and no window. Room got hot too but luckily there was a fan which was a good addition. Also an iron and ironing board which were useful. Walls thin and had noisy neighbours, which didn't help with sleeping. Breakfast plentiful and good choice of hot food, served freshly made to order. Bathroom wasn't cleaned so a big X for that."
3983,The Swan Hotel,"This is the fourth time we’ve stayed here and it’s always lovely. The staff are always friendly, the rooms are clean and the breakfast is really good. Jenny, Lewis, Callum and Carla on the Night Shift were super accommodating, as was Amberle on breakfast. We’ll definitely be back!"
3984,The Swan Hotel,"The Swan is a wonderful place to stay. The staff are superb, as is the food, especially for vegetarians and vegans. It's incredible dog friendly. It's always a joy to stay there, The location is easy to get to and a great starting point for a trip."
3985,The Swan Hotel,"Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was great, dog friendly with separate area for dining, dog bed and bowl in the room. With on site free carpark in the city centre. Our room was a bit corporate but very clear and plenty of space"
3986,The Swan Hotel,"The central location is good for shopping and additional places to eat and drink etc but it is also the reason for average sleep mark. It was loud in the room with music and general chatter whilst the pub was open and then again very early morning with outside noise such as church bells, deliveries and street sweeper vehicles. There was also a marathon event starting from directly outside the pub which added to the noise and we were blocked in the car park for over an hour. The room was a little ‘worn’ in places but it was large and well equipped and the bed was extremely comfortable! The freshly cooked breakfast was excellent and delicious. Overall, a good place to stay and good value due to high quality breakfast being included but just be aware of special event weekends and…"
3987,The Swan Hotel,"Popular hotel for lunch and coffees. Great location in the centre of town. Lots of atmosphere, friendly staff. Rooms comfortable and good selection of tea and coffee. Breakfast was freshly cooked which meant we had to wait 30 minutes bit of a pain but continental section to keep you going. able to park the car in car park before check in at 3pm and leave in car park until we were ready to leave."
3988,The Swan Hotel,"Everything superb, staff, food, hotel in general, situation for amenities. Only one thing about our room was, we were above the kitchen and there was a constant noise like an extractor fan all through the night and as I am a light sleeper I didn't sleep well but my husband did. Will be badck but will book a different room."
3989,The Swan Hotel,This hotel was exactly the location I needed it for my place of work. Adequate room and the staff were friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needs to be in this area of the country and is close to town
3990,The Swan Hotel,"Lovely old place with a modern interior comfortable chairs and stools in bar area, nice atmosphere, staff very friendly. The room was ok but couple of things let it down , the bathroom was a little tight , having to sit on the loo sideways because the towel rail is in the way which means you cannot sit straight, the side of the bath has a crack in it plus some white tape on the edge of the bath, some of the grouting on the tiles was very discoloured and the corner of the shower glass door had black mould in it. The bed was comfy tv was ok wardrobe was plenty big enough, even iron and ironing board was supplied, only problem was in the morning we had no hot water ( some problem with pipes and boiler or something), offered no recompense for not being able to shower or a bath my…"
3991,The Swan Hotel,"We stayed here for one night, on initial inspection it seemed very nice and clean. The staff were welcoming and very hospitable. Unfortunately for us the fire alarms kept going off in the evening rendering the kitchen unusable and no hot meals. This was not good and a big letdown, in the morning they had a water leak and there was no hot water. Could it get any worse? The room was very warm and I tried to open the window to my shock there were con webs that clearly had not been cleared for a couple of years. But hats off to Sarah duty manager who apologised and tried to address the issues as well as offering a partial refund. I would give this hotel another chance some day as I think it was just bad luck"
3992,The Swan Hotel,"Great hotel, brilliant breakfast, clean tidy and very nicely furnished rooms! The only thing that put me off slightly was being told one of the ghosts visits the room I was staying in although I was that drunk I’d have had a conversation with it! Thanks would recommend!"
3993,The Swan Hotel,"Been for a drink after a stressful day at work, staff look happy, great atmosphere, friendly staff who have knowledge of the bar and just lovely surroundings. Will definitely visit again... And soon. 😊"
3994,The Swan Hotel,"I was all up for giving a 4 or 5 star review until the Saturday night. We stayed for Friday & Saturday night in a deluxe double and ate in the restaurant on the Friday night. On arriving we had to park in the overflow car park (no issue), but were not told we had to move the cars at 8am (bit of a shock when that call came through). On moving them there was no space in the main car park and no recommendation from reception on what to do (I am not local so had no idea either). The room was lovely, overlooked the high street, clean, spacious, had a comfy mattress and blackout curtains. The bathroom was a good size but whoever plumbed in the shower clearly didn’t think where to put the tap and couldn’t have got it worse. If you were not careful you would knock it off/hot/cold,…"
3995,The Swan Hotel,"A nice clean hotel and decent bar area. Bedroom was good. Check in service was quick and efficient. The breakfast service was poor, ordered a cooked breakfast which took a long time to arrive was cold"
3996,The Swan Hotel,"Had a one night stay here to visit friends and have dinner. All was great lovely hotel with nice rooms and a great breakfast. Unfortunately the only memory I've taken with me was on my return to the hotel after our night out in the town. We decided to go for a nightcap at the hotel at around 11.15 where we were greeted by a barman who was obviously used to working at a working man's club. No greeting just an abrupt you can't get served here mate were closed.......... and then unless you are a resident!! I duly placed my room card on the bar to which he replied ""THAT DOESNT MEAN ANYTHING TO ME"" I was gobsmacked and not on my own as his colleague also told him to pretty much wind his neck in. The atmosphere was now thick so we decided we would take our substandard drinks (My G&T…"
3997,The Swan Hotel,We were a party of 24 of mixed ages for a celebratory meal. Our meals were fantastic. The food was delicious with very generous portions. The service was very great and everyone was satisfied. Some of our party stayed in the hotel. I would highly recommend The Swan as a venue for occasions.
3998,The Swan Hotel,"We popped in for lunch following the swans restaurant refurbishment . Nice surroundings mostly absolutely awful staff who’s customer who were urgently in need of customer service training where they clearly lacked even the basic skills . I was directed through two serving areas to the front of the hotel to order where I was greeted by a surly attendant who asked for my order with an abrupt questioning technique , no smile clearly not happy in her work . On several occasions there was a female member of the hotel staff walking around the bars who appeared to be a senior member of the restaurant team . No reciprocal smiles for this member of the team when nearing her presence to any member of our group ( my wife my daughter in law and myself ) just a cold stare and a glowering…"
3999,The Swan Hotel,"We stayed one night as our friends were having their wedding lunch there. Great location for the centre of the town, lovely ambience with lots of quirky features and a lively feel to the bar and coffee areas. Room wise generally good, reasonable quality bed, only slight let down was that the room was a bit on the chilly side and while there was an electric radiator to take the edge off the duvet was quite thin and there was no extra duvet or blanket in the room. If we’d have stayed another night we’d have requested one for sure, and I’m sure it would have been no problem- the service was generally excellent and very friendly."
4000,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Amazing hotel & atmosphere is wonderful. The food in the restaurant is 10/10. I love the fact you can walk to pretty much all the shops, this is very convenient as I don’t like getting the tube. Will definitely stay again."
4001,"The Hoxton, Holborn","We had a tremendous stay at the Hoxton over the Long weekend at the end of May. The hotel is ideally situated close to the main shopping streets and restaurants. The staff are well trained and really friendly. The hotel has a modern vibe, but the service remains traditionally excellent. The menu is varied and includes the needs of meat lovers and vegetarians. We would highly recommend this hotel as a great central point to a weekend in London. We will definitely be visiting again."
4002,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I picked this hotel because we were arriving at 7AM from an overnight train from Edinburgh (on the Caledonian). We got to the hotel at 8AM, and with their 'pick your check in time' option were able to get right into our room for a quick nap and shower. The hotel was fresh and clean. Great bed too. We had the Cozy room, which was plenty for 2 people for just 1 night. It would have been too small for more than a few days though."
4003,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Our room smelled like trash or a small animal had died in there. After two requests for them to make it right by fixing the smell or giving us a new room, we gave up. We will not stay here again, which is unfortunate because it was in a really great location."
4004,"The Hoxton, Holborn",We stayed here with a big group after our wedding and the hotel and staff were amazing. They were so accommodating and helpful. Thank you Hox team! It was a great few days. We had the best time thanks to your team!
4005,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Dissapont about the rooms qaulity, very Tiny, and there where Not much room for you closeth. Your suitcases’s could noy be hiding anywhere and When the room is tiny there is enough space for that. You should ask in the reception to get your room cleaned."
4006,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Having stayed at several branches of The Hoxton around the world, I know i'm always going to get a good welcome and a good nights sleep. Check in was fast and friendly and I really appreciate their free early checkin/late checkout service for repeat customers too."
4007,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Lovely hotel, great location, and excellent customer service. I'll be honest, I stayed at The Hoxton Holborn in October 2022 and the hotel was lovely, my room was disappointing, and the customer service from the restaurant manager was abominable. I shared my concerns with hotel management, and asked that I give them a second chance. I did just that, and everyone went above and beyond to assure I had a quality stay. My room had brighter decor that I was excepting and very comfortable. The lobby is a wonderful place to hang out and people watch or read a book if you don't mind a lot of action (I don't, I love it). The location is excellent. A block from Holborn tube station and steps away from Covent Garden. It is also an easy walk to Liberty London, a favorite stop of mine, as…"
4008,"The Hoxton, Holborn","For £240 a night (exc breakfast) I expect my room to be made up - the bins to be emptied, tea / coffee / milk to be replenished and the bed made. Apparently this isn’t the case at the Hoxton Holborn, obviously too busy serving hipsters on their laptops in the lobby it forgets that it is primarily a hotel and the basic service requirements of a hotel. Terrible- avoid at all costs"
4009,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Visited in the late PM of 20th May 2023 to the bar for social drinks post-performance with entertainment industry. This review is specifically for Maya and Christi working on the bar floor area. The venue itself was stunning and lighting perfect and background music low enough for conversation, all extremely appreciated, but we are writing this review specifically because of the actions and professionalism of Maya and Christi. Both were incredible; Maya super warm, personable and helpful, going above and beyond and welcoming us in a way we had no expectation of but really appreciated. Christi was exceedingly professional and smiling setting a great mood, no question or request too large and no need too small. Both hit that mark of being genuine but also highly…"
4010,"The Hoxton, Holborn","After 3 years of absence (due to pandemic) we came back to Hoxton and it was the same amazing experience as ever. It felt like homecoming. Welcoming staff, great service, super beds and a nice crowd in the lobby"
4011,"The Hoxton, Holborn","A beautiful hotel. Lobby & restaurant/bar area is very cool. The room was very clean, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was wonderful with a rainfall shower. The staff was so kind and helpful - particularly Faiza. We would highly recommend this hotel."
4012,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I really loved this hotel! I booked a ""snug"" room which I was initially worried about being too small but it was the perfect size for one guest. No need to upgrade. It has all you need and it was super clean. Absolutely fabulous location - right near the tube. I was on the first floor and I had no issues with noise which was my main concern. Slept great. Loved the lobby and the hotel atmosphere/decor - such a cool vibe. I would stay here again. It was worth going above my budget. There are definitely cheaper options but I wanted a low key night in after a long trip and didn't want to worry about cleanliness, service etc...so this was great."
4013,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I was staying in the hotel for a business trip. I think this is a perfect place to start your after work sightseeing. You can easily reach the most important sights either by walking or taking the tube that has a stop 1 minute from the hotel. (This tube also connects you to the airport.) There are lots of restaurants in walking distance, and you can also find pubs for a drink at night and if you feel like staying in the hotel, there is a restaurant on the ground floor. I liked this location so much because it was close to everything yet not that busy as it gets in the center of the city (e.g. Soho area). One tip though, if you are planning to work from your room, make sure you ask for a bright room because some of the rooms get only a little natural light and you have to use all…"
4014,"The Hoxton, Holborn",Visited last month. Was a lovely trip and the Hoxton was fantastic. Great bar and even better cocktails! James was also a delight and made our visit even more enjoyable! Will be back soon 🍹 Thanks again!
4015,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Enjoyed every bit of my visit, was made a lovely oat milk cappuccino by the lovely bartender Fran who always no matter how busy she was , still made time to check up on me, which was comforting, don’t get that a lot."
4016,"The Hoxton, Holborn",The property was nicely styled and everything clean. It was exactly as advertised. Great location near theatre district. We loved it. But what really made it so nice was the staff. They were so helpful and patient with all of our questions and needs. Bartender remembered us each night we stopped for a night cap. Will definitely stay here next time we're in London
4017,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Friendly service, clean room, great room service and the entire hotel is a vibe! Also - the location was conveniently located while feeling safe, which is worth a mention! Will definitely be back next time in London."
4018,"The Hoxton, Holborn",We loved our stay at the Hoxton! Very friendly and accomodating front desk staff and fabulously located between Bloomsbury and Covent Garden. We opted for a bigger room with King sized bed and were quite comfortable. The lobby is a fun hangout place to have drinks or coffee. Highly recommend and hope to stay there again.
4019,"The Hoxton, Holborn","i ordered at the bar and was served by two wonderful bartenders, James and Francis. they both entertained and served me both impeccable levels of professionalism. could'nt recommend a better place two relax and have a lovely conversation."
4020,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the heart of London. Direct line from Heathrow airport to Holborn Station, and a short stroll to Covent Garden was a bonus. Food and beverages menu was varied and delicious; and the rooms were comfortable, clean and quiet."
4021,"The Hoxton, Holborn","This hotel has all the amenities you need when you're on a short business trip. Convenient for me, my office was just around the corner, it was easy to get to. Lovely staff, Elena made me feel very welcome and gave me recommendations for the area. Would definitely stay again."
4022,"The Hoxton, Holborn",really comfortable hotel and close to so many sites and amenities we recommend this for couples both old and young coming to London for a weekend breakfast is big enough to share so don't order two. you'll be sorry and unable to move
4023,"The Hoxton, Holborn","A lovely hotel shoebox room - small, but nice and cozy and perfect for a one or two night stay. Perfect location in terms of transport links and proximity to everything London has to offer. We didn't eat in the restaurant on this occasion but have done in the past and it was very good."
4024,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I often study in the lobby, and I've always found the atmosphere to be really conducive to a good study session. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, always wearing a smile. Notably, Brune. She works evenings, and despite the demanding groups of people, she always made an effort to make sure that the people quietly working or studying are not left out and made to feel at home. Thank you, Brune."
4025,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Very nice hotel and wonderful room. Unfortunately they do not make up the room, you have to do yourself even if the rate is quite expensive. Also the minibar is not replenished daily either. Good restaurant."
4026,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Loved the room, it was a great size for the two of us. The restaurant downstairs was amazing, we ate there twice during our stay. Staff was very friendly, and the location was good. Overall made the visit very comfortable and was a nice hotel for a first visit to London - would stay here again."
4027,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Beatrice is amazing! I had some room struggles, and she patiently helped me with an upgrade - went above and beyond to show me all my options and work through things with me. Greatly appreciated her help - made my stay complete!"
4028,"The Hoxton, Holborn","With 8 days in London, my agenda was to explore the city, meet new people, take in lots of art, performance and business connections. As a solo, female I love to have a ""home away from home"" from which to venture out and experience a city, returning to the cozy and familiar to rest and restore. The Hoxton, Holborn was just such a venue for me. This boutique hotel is in a safe neighborhood of many shops, pubs, nearby parks and eateries. Most of my daily destinations were beyond this area, and when I wanted to get in over 10,000 steps I could end up at the Thames and spend an afternoon at the Tate and meander the river's walkway. In the evening it's an easy location to hail a cab or Uber to go to the theatre. I understand the trains are also all conveniently nearby. That…"
4029,"The Hoxton, Holborn","This hotel was quite and perfect for staying in the room but what made it even better was the lobby space. Perfect space to work in and have breakfast that would seamlessly transition a bar vibe as the day went on. As someone who was traveling for half work and half fun, it was the perfect location for me."
4030,"The Hoxton, Holborn",The lobby and the design of the hotel is amazing! Good music and beautiful people -rooms are small! Service is amazing at the front desk- has issue and Sepha helped me right away - so i stayed one more night
4031,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I stayed at The Hoxton to celebrate my 30 birthday and had a wonderful experience! Upon arrival to my room, I noticed that a couple of birthday treats had been left for me (a bottle of wine, some chocolates, a Hoxton tote bag and a handwritten note). I was blown away by the thoughtfulness and it was a brilliant start to my birthday weekend. The bed and the pillows were incredibly comfortable, the room was spotless and the aesthetic o the hotel is unmatched. I also want to shout out Beatrice and Ella for being so kind and contributing to making this birthday a special one! I can't wait to visit The Hoxton again and will definitely be staying longer than one night next time."
4032,"The Hoxton, Holborn","You will not find a nicer team of people than here, they elevate the hotel to the highest levels. Excellent service, great food, nothing is any trouble. Fun, relaxed but high quality vibe and very welcoming, comfortable environment."
4033,"The Hoxton, Holborn","My stay at the Hoxton Hotel, Holborn was exceptional! Everything (and I mean everything) was to a high standard, and the receptionist Beatrice was extremely accommodating, friendly and polite. Customer service like this is priceless! Thank you Hoxton Hotel, Holborn…I will be back, and I will be recommending you to everybody!!!"
4034,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I loved this hotel. The room was clean with everything you'd need. It's also in a great location - a 10 minute walk from the theatre district. I didn't use it but there is a restaurant/bar area next to reception - clearly very popular. Only two minor things to note - my room had an adjoining door to another room. Locked as not in use. However, I could hear conversations next door. I was only there for one night and out for the evening so it didn't bother me. The second thing was it took a few days to receive a copy of my invoice. My email was taken down incorrectly on arrival and the printer wasn't working on checkout - a couple of emails and one phone call later and I did get my invoice."
4035,"The Hoxton, Holborn","This is my second time at The Hoxton Holborn, it’s the best! The vibe, atmosphere and location makes it just perfect. I love the room’s design and decoration. It’s definitely my favorite hotel in London."
4036,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Good rooms, clean, good location to transit and the rest of London. Straight love to LHR on tube. The restaurant was good enough to eat there every day. Minus, was that there were a lot of digital nomad hawking all the lobby chairs. Which could be a little annoying. Do you really when to work from a hotel lobby, digital Nomad? It’s called working From home For a Reason. “Home”. I guess home Ish we’re the heart is though. I doubt it’s at a hotel lobby though."
4037,"The Hoxton, Holborn","We picked the Hoxton due to its location to other things we had planned. The hotel was lovely, everything we could have wished for. It was my wife’s birthday and I mentioned this in my booking. After arriving in our room which they had ready for us early we had a knock at the door and my wife was presented with some chocolates and a card with a free round of drinks at the bar. It was a very nice touch."
4038,"The Hoxton, Holborn",We had such a great time at the Hoxton. Service was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect. Staff was super friendly and everything was clean and well curated. I’ll be booking with the Hoxton any chance I can.
4039,"The Hoxton, Holborn","To be avoided, if you are looking for terrible communication and service from the hotel then just don't bother. I paid for an upgrade and they blocked GBP 100 on my card and then deducted another GBP 100 (I am fine with that), however, they did NOT inform me prior to. When I called to ask why it was deducted - the girl at the reception said they are running their credit history. What kind of an answer is that, she was not friendly at all and was snarky. Do not go with an attitude that the client is always right as they will prove you otherwise :) for mistakes they do. I called her manager, and after asking her THREE Times to state what was the charges, she finally told me what was the deduction for, again, with a salty attitude. Both are poorly trained, not friendly, do NOT…"
4040,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Fabulous, cool and friendly atmosphere. My new favourite London place. Friendly but calm and understated staff. Outstanding food at reasonable prices, in a beautifully designed space. Very relaxing with an overriding feeling of quality - yes this IS England!"
4041,"The Hoxton, Holborn",Beautiful hotel but the best part was the staff! Had an issue after checkout where I’d left my headphones behind in the room and the front desk team - particularly Elena and Ciaran were amazing. I’m so grateful for their kindness and patience in helping me find them - they are truly gems THANK YOU!!
4042,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Loved the hotel vibe. Reception staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Rooms had everything you needed and were beautifully presented. Would definitely stay again. Location great. Within walking distance of Euston and theatres."
4043,"The Hoxton, Holborn","I stayed for one night yesterday to be in town for the marathon. It turned out to be a great choice of hotel. There's a real buzz in the lobby/bar/restaurant, although I only used the restaurant for breakfast, which was good. The rooms are lovely and the service is excellent. As I was running the marathon the really helpful reception staff let me have a late check-out. They were also really lovely and chatty and seemed genuinely interested in me doing the race. This wasn't just one of them, but I spoke to around 4 members of the team, who were all great. As a result of the service and general quality and feel of the hotel I'll definitely be back."
4044,"The Hoxton, Holborn",Just for 2 nights stay in London my trip was very comfortable. Friendly and helpful personal made this stay even more comfy. The central location of the hotel makes it easy to reach from the St. Pancras train station. Close to the British national museum and Royal opera house which was also important
4045,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Excelent hotel, great location and staff was always helpful. Restaurants and British museum are nearby. Rooms are very clean and very comfortable. Also a subway stop is around the corner. Will recommend this hotel for a stay in London!"
4046,"The Hoxton, Holborn","The hotel is beautiful and the staff were friendly and incredibly helpful. The bar's mixologist John was our favorite, he was impressively knowledgeable about cocktails, and gave us suggestions about where else to visit around London as well."
4047,"The Hoxton, Holborn",We had such a special trip and a big thanks is to The Hoxton. The staff couldnt have been nicer with hotel needs along with trip suggestions and personal touches. We are so excited to try out other Hoxton locations and will most definitely be returning to The Hoxton Holborn.
4048,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Located in a perfect ventral location, Hoxton Holborn is the place you are happy to stay in. Friendly staff, lively lobby where you can as well work or have a drink and very confortable room. A perfect place to stay in Central London."
4049,"The Hoxton, Holborn","Excellent location, very nice lobby perfect for meeting friends. Quite a hip sort of atmosphere so was fun. Nice restaurant for breakfast. Very small room but then again it was a 'shoe box' so as advertised. All in all very good and I will stay here again."
4050,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Our stay at the thyme restaurant at the premier inn hotel was very enjoyable. Service was amazing. Nothing was too much trouble. Thank you very much Tim you are a very helpful/pleasant man. Good food. Lovely atmosphere.
4051,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,We always use Bath road prem inn when going to the states . The rooms are always clean and comfortable. Good pillows . The only thing is they need more phone charging plugs and tissues in the room . The resultant is great a very good menu the service is always good and you don’t wait long for the food to come out the ambience and decor is nice and the house wines are good too . Can recommend the meal deal . Drinks and snacks always available . All staff were very helpful and friendly indeed . You can also watch the planes come in too . It’s currently being refurbished !
4052,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Beds were super comfortable, hotel was basic and most rooms have window facing atrium not outside. Have to pay for shuttle to airport and it’s not walkable. Price went down 15% 1 hour after I booked it on day of stay which was really annoying. Parking was expensive and room could have done with a deep clean."
4053,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"On the surface staff are friendly, however I didn’t experience any real customer service when needed. I stayed in a premier plus room, the air conditioning was great, however the glasses, one in particular could have been cleaned better, as could the edges of the toilet. I’m not sure, but maybe there was a shelf missing from one side of the bed?"
4054,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Highly recommend this clean, comfortable, good value hotel. Hoppa Bus (6 pounds per trip) connects this hotel to Terminal 3 and 5. Comfortable beds and duvet. Electric kettle. Tea bags. Instant coffee with sugar and milk. Hair dryer. Very nice staff. Thyme Restaurant and Costa Coffee downstairs are convenient and good. WIFI tends to drop, but this is minor compared to all the positives."
4055,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Tim was polite and friendly and was more than happy to explain the options on the menu, he brought the food quickly and provided water without us asking! Overall great service I. The restaurant! Thanks Tim!!"
4056,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Stayed here many times and it’s actually my fave place when I’m traveling in / out of heathrow. However this visit was mixed… The good: the restaurant… decent food for a good price… especially breakfast. Staff very friendly including the super chipper Navmeet. The bad: the room I was given seemed to be directly below a building site. Ridiculous amount of noise during the day when I was trying to work. Also the AC system in the room clearly wasn’t working and some janky fan was in there to i guess try and help. On arrival, the room also had no desk chair but one was swiftly supplied once I rated the issue with the housekeeping staff. Overall it’s a decent place and I will probably stay there again but this visit was definitely below par."
4057,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"We visited the thyme restaurant, Vic served us .he was amazing extremely professional, polite, charming could not fault him .thankyou Vic. Food was excellent prepared by chef brando .thankyou. would recommend the restaurant to anyone."
4058,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Excellent staff, very clean and comfortable. Thyme restaurant had excellent staff and good food. Not much noise from aircraft! Perfect hotel for flying from Heathrow. Only fault if it qualifies as a fault, was the low noise of the air conditioning unit. I switched it off and then woke up too hot in the middle of the night."
4059,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"The staff were lovely, breakfast was good with a good selection. The room was clean but very hot, almost unbearable, as the air conditioning wasn't working. I asked for a fan and it was brought to the room. It didn't make much difference though, and I struggled to sleep. I would stay here again only if the air con is in working order, as it is good hotel in every other way."
4060,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Looks very basic from the outside but surprisingly modern inside. Rooms looking very tired and basic but it worked for a one night stay for an early pick up from Heathrow. No shuttle bus included and was a bit expensive but cheaper than parking at the airport
4061,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Hotel is modern and when we stayed some refurbishment was taking place. Check in was simple, but I should have noted that a extra carpark charge of £15 needed to be paid. Had supper in the hotel restaurant “Thyme”, food was middle of the road, but the service we had from Nitin was first class."
4062,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"The price for the Premier Inn Plus Room was fantastic as well as the air conditioning, (even though the outside temperatures were 30 Degrees) - The room presentation was to a top standard and very clean. It is the best Premier Inn we have stayed at, as the Hotel decoration is fantastic. The hotel onsite restaurant was amazing and relaxing, the food was of a good standard. Tim who was our main-waiter made our evening at the restaurant great. (He deserves a big pat on the back for excellent customer service). Check In / Check Out was a breeze and the staff very helpful and friendly. We have booked again in 2 weeks, for when our son returns. (We cannot wait for the great experience again that we had)."
4063,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Another great stay for one night before flying. Star are very friendly and helpful Great atmosphere in the evening for dinner and drinks The only down side is car parking for one night when you have to leave so early in the morning
4064,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Location is ideal for the airport if like us you have to rely on public transport, we used the 111 bus stops right outside the airport and right out side the hotel. Hotel was great , spacious clean staff brilliant especially the Costa employees only downfall no air conditioning working and you seal the windows.stop doing that premier inn if your ac doesn’t work, I’ve actually never been in a premier inn and the ac works.it’s unbearable To sleep in especially a family room. If you stopped sealing the windows this would be a perfect hotel. Also maybe some benches out the front would be brilliant , we needed to go outside because the room was so hot but nowhere to sit."
4065,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,We had a amazing dinner in thyme the food was top quality cannot fault it at all thank you Chef Brando & thank you Vic who took our orders & served our food he was just delightful nothing was too much bother fantastic service thank you
4066,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Stopped off at Premiere Inn in between flights. My server Mario was great and very attentive. Always checked back to make sure everything was good with my food. Great service and food was nice. Thanks!
4067,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Really impressed with the staff especially GETTA & GRAZEL who were extremely friendly and helpful , fantastic customer service and extremely caring and a true credit to the premiere inn brand . Hotel is a great choice and is close to The airport , nice restaurant and costa coffee in lobby with great staff also . Highly recommend this hotel ."
4068,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Staff were brilliant! When I arrived the staff were quick to see to me and get me in my room so the trip could start. They were also very informative and did all they could to assist me. I would highly recommend
4069,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Beautiful newly renovated room. Comfortable bed, pillows & quilt. No negatives about the room. Ate dinner and breakfast in Thyme restaurant. Lovely food, good quality, tasty 😋. All the staff without exception were excellent."
4070,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Breakfast is amazing, balanced, and versatile. It’s traditional continental style. And the breakfast team serves us nicely. Especially, I would like to thank Irina’s assistance. I am enjoying the stay in Premier Inn."
4071,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"This hotel was easy to get to from Heathrow and then easy to return to in the morning. I highly recommend just taking the red bus to and from the hotel because it is super affordable and just as quick as any other option. The bus stop is directly in front of the hotel. The room was clean and spacious. Needed to be updated but that did not deter anything during my stay. The bathroom was nice and everything in the room worked well. The beds were comfy as well. The check in and check out process was seamless. My brother and I walked to Tesco (less than 10 min walk away) for dinner but the hotel seemed to have plenty of options available, just at a bit higher of a price. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
4072,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Waiter (Savio) was excellent Food was poor for value fir money. Worst humous ever! Room ok. No plugs near bed. Very basic. Just basic. Won’t be a first choice. Staff nice enough. Rooms need a refurb
4073,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Excellent service and food. Our server Tim was very attentive and friendly. We had the chicken wings for our starter and also steak and ale pie for our main dish. Both were delicious. We stay here often and love the hotel and staff. They are always so friendly!
4074,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"I’ve been going to this hotel for nearly 15 years either with work, family or friends. Across the years parking was free, then £8, £10, £12 (last September) and now £15 per night! Customer service was emailed, insulting feedback. Advising that it’s now a privately owned car park, they have no control over the prices. I choose this hotel because of how close it is to the aircraft landing at the airport for my hobby. You now have to pay extra for runway facing view rooms! Becoming far too expensive! If you have to use this hotel, pay for parking in purple parking next store. Charging £10 a night is better and acceptable, but I’ll unfortunately start taking my business elsewhere which is a shame."
4075,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"I stayed at the hotel on 21st May following the cancellation of a flight at LGW. I was amazed how prepared the hotel staff were for our arrival and particularly impressed that the hotel had kept the restaurant open for us for a meal in the early hours. I've eaten here before and the curries are always of an excellent standard and even at 1am this was the case! The same caring staff were there again for breakfast next day and I would particularly like to mention Leander who was so customer focussed even though he'd been up half the night having served us dinner too and a female kitchen staff member (whose name I didn't get), who also took care of my gluten-free needs. Many thanks for their dedication."
4076,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Great service/location but a no frills hotel - nice little coffe/tea shop and a basic restaurant in lobby! the only downfall is the 3pm checkin which brings it down a a notch and more! However, Geeta was amazing, and helped us with storing luggage until rooms were available."
4077,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Not the first Premier Inn we’ve stayed in and this is great value for an airport hotel. Clean and modern with great staff. We also had dinner in the restaurant - sirloin steaks cooked perfectly. Our server Matei was very prompt and helpful.
4078,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"This is a fab premier inn, nice and clean and comfortable. Such friendly staff. From the check in to the restaurant all have been great. A big shout out to Tim in the Thyme restaurant. He was so helpful."
4079,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Very efficient and helpful staff. The restaurant was clean and there was a vast variety of breakfast options. Abdul was especially friendly, who greeted and seated me. I also enjoyed a pizza in the evening here. However, the rooms were extremely dated and need of refurbishment - which I understand they may be upgrading. All in all I had a great sleep! The best I’ve had all week actually."
4080,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Was a great one night stay. We had food in the main restaurant and served by Savio who was great and looked after us. Food quality was excellent and we made the most of the meal deal which is excellent value for money.
4081,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Feels like it needs a bit of a refurb now, especially bedrooms. We had the smallest TV I’ve seen in a hotel room for years! Air con worked well but looked like part of a Plane fuselage. It is an airport hotel I guess. Talking of which, I can’t believe it’s an airport hotel but you have to pay for a bus (either public or Hoppa) to get to Terminal 2 & 3, long gone are the free shuttles, which isn’t great. We had a pleasant meal at Thyme and a decent breakfast before heading off to the Airport. The meal deal is the saving grace for this hotel. All in all not a bad hotel by any stretch but unless you’re driving it’s a bit of a pain to get to and not as easy as you’d imagine to get to the airport considering its proximity. Bring back the free airport shuttles!!"
4082,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Comfortable room with all facilities for the night. The room lacked available points to charge devices. Abdul was very attentive and made our breakfast experience extremely enjoyable. The meal deal is well worth it.
4083,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,The food in the restaurant was nice and the server Savio was very good. We were served quickly and our gluten allergy was well considered. The hotel is clean and has lots of seating at the bar and in the restaurant
4084,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Lovely dinner in Thyme restaurant with our excellent waiter Savio taking great care of us! He was super attentive and so friendly. Food was tasty and great value for money, well worth a visit if you stay at this Premier Inn."
4085,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Great service at dinner from Tim. He explained the meal deal is a helpful way and was patient with children choosing their meal and drinks. The beds were comfortable. Helpful Hoper service to the airport.
4086,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Food across uk always good at a good price. Hotels clean. Visited England and Scotland. Staff were friendly and helpful. Premeier inns will always be hotels to consider especially since they seem to be everywhere we went.
4087,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Had a great stay. Was checked in by a lovely lady called Geeta who was really friendly and super funny with her sense of humour, just what we needed after the long day we had. Geeta gave us one of the new rooms which made it even more special for us and the new room we stayed in was very nice thank you for that."
4088,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Big thank you to Geeta! Just landed at Heathrow with post holiday blues already and were greeted by a very friendly Geeta who sorted us a lovely new room and service with a smile! A nice warm welcome back to the UK!
4089,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"I was very impressed with service I received, in particular from Mayur. He was very helpful at checking in and the room he allocated me was perfect! Thos Hotel has everything required and is beautifully kept."
4090,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Lovely to be greeted by Queency’s smile and very efficient service on my arrival. All the staff were great and I enjoyed my delicious meal in the restaurant. Perfect stopover before my flight tomorrow morning. Thank you!
4091,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Excellent service from Geeta. Perfect location for airport Having evening meal hopefully that will be as good. Will comment later after dinner Love the new rooms and upgrade Thank you for your help We will be back again in o august and October.
4092,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Just stayed one night only before early flight , it was great being so close to the airport terminal We had an evening meal in the Thyme restaurant we didn’t have breakfast There is a Costa coffee in the foyer and a pub so ideal We would definitely stay again if ever flying from Heathrow again You do have to pay £15 for overnight parking , hotel is very big as is car park"
4093,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Stay here quite frequently for work as I’m cabin crew so in and out of hotels frequently. Anyways I’d messed up the dates of my booking and the wonderful Melwyn managed to sort them for me as was really helpful and nice in the process of this. He also assigned me one of the lovely newly refurbished rooms which was lovely of him. Thanks so much for all you’re help hopefully see you soon!
4094,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Brilliant service from Venetia. She sorted a problem with my booking when we realised that my company had made a mistake & booked the wrong hotel! All done with an easy smile & a friendly attitude. Many thanks!
4095,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"Was put off by descriptions of building work disruption and warning that car parking might not be available but one night stop over for an early flight was great! Amazingly helpful site security helped us find a parking space. Comfortable rooms, quiet - which is unusual at airport hotel. Surprisingly good / buzzy atmosphere in bar / restaurant area as we arrived, along with Starbucks to grab a drink and go - great start to our holiday!"
4096,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Our room was stuffy and hot . We realized we had trouble with the air conditioner in our room. After it was examined it could not be fixed and after a short while we were moved to another room on the same floor so it was an easy change . Managed fairly quickly and efficiently. Rooms were clean and quiet.. comfortable bed. We would stay again.
4097,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,Geeta on reception was really lovely and friendly as well as informative. The room was larger than expected and the bed was very comfortable. Bar and restaurant open late and a Costa coffee shop in reception. A great place to stay close to Heathrow Airport.
4098,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,"The checkin was quite smooth. On the website it says you can pay an extra 10 pounds and get a late checkout, and I was hoping to avail of this facility but apparently this facility is no longer available. :( The sink in the bathroom was plugged and there was no apparent way to unplug it. As a result water was not draining out. Went to the reception twice to see if someone can fix it, they said they'd send the maintenance staff up to sort it, but no one came. But apart from these issues, the breakfast was good(kudos to Gisel and Chef Ravi for this) and the room was comfy. The front desk staff were well mannered too, although they were not able to help with the issues mentioned above. All in all, ok for a one night stopover on your way to/from heathrow airport."
4099,Premier Inn London Heathrow Airport T2 & T3 (Bath Road) hotel,We had a great breakfast on our way to the airport. Gizel and Tacki were really friendly and helpful. The restaurant was nice and quiet and the range of food was good for the price. Thank you for a lovely send off for our holiday.
4100,H10 London Waterloo,"Possibly the best hotel we have ever stayed at, bedding great, room size more than adequate, air conditioning, everything works, quiet, friendly efficient staff, unbelievable choice at breakfast, 6 minutes to Waterloo station, we were on a luxury escape package and so pleased we have second package booked for next week so are able to leave a couple of pieces of luggage, haven’t tried the rooftop bar, intend to do that next week, you can pay a lot more for a hotel in london, hard to think anything could be better,"
4101,H10 London Waterloo,Had a great birthday weekend here. All the staff are so friendly & helpful. Plate of sweet treats in my room on my birthday was a nice surprise. Sky Bar is a great place to watch the sunset at Waterloo. Breakfasts are great with added extra of churros & chocolate! Felipe was lovely to give us cava on my birthday! This is our 2nd visit & we will be back.
4102,H10 London Waterloo,"We loved the hotel, the room was immaculate, so clean and everything we needed! We stayed in a H10 in Spain and this was equally lovely! To be greeted with a drink and such friendly staff was brilliant and nothing was too much trouble! Breakfast brilliant something for everyone! Thank you fabulous"
4103,H10 London Waterloo,"I've just stayed for two nights during a weekend visit to London, the hotel is in a great location just a short walk from Waterloo Station. Upon arrival reception was busy but the staff were friendly and offered us a glass of cava or juice as a welcome. Our room was on the 5th floor and a very generous size especially by London standards. It was spotless and modern. The bed was a great size and comfortable. The bathroom was a decent size with a shower over the bath, I think my only criticism of the hotel would be that the pressure on the shower wasn't great. Breakfast was fantastic with a massive range of choice in a nice environment with friendly service, and the rooftop bar is also a must visit as the views are incredible! Had a great stay and will definitely return!"
4104,H10 London Waterloo,An excellent hotel well positioned for Waterloo train and underground station. An arrival glass of bubbly was a nice touch and although the rooms are not huge they are well appointed and clean. The staff are excellent and friendly and there is a good breakfast with food to suit everyone. Recommended
4105,H10 London Waterloo,"So promising but such a let down. My wife and I were very much looking forward to staying at H10 Waterloo. With the high reputation and the cost being $330 CDN you think they would actually deliver 4stars. Pros: -let us check in early at 11 AM -Location -Comfortable bed CONS: -Toilet continuously ran (called and was told to bang with hand) -room right next to rooftop bar loud until 12 AM, sounded as if our door was wide open -Air broken -Overall shape of the room (tiles cracked, paint chipped, windows have constant whistle -Phone broken -nice touch with the bathroom scale *doesn’t work -Both sink and tub plugs broken -no wash cloths There are too many hotels in London for anyone to choose this one."
4106,H10 London Waterloo,"Beautiful hotel, staff very accommodating. We were greeted with welcome drinks at reception and a room upgrade. When we got to our room someone came up with a brownie for us which was delicious! The rooms were very clean, with everything you need including shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, shower cap, shaving kit, toothbrushes etc. the skybar was wonderful (£9 for a mocktail seemed expensive?) but amazing views out of every window!"
4107,H10 London Waterloo,"The breakfast spread is huge, and tastes amazing. The hotel staff is excellent, thorough, and very nice. Our rooms were very nice. Our family of 4 adults would 100% stay in this hotel again, without any hesitation. It’s perfect for Ubers to pick up and drop off. Very convenient to shops, restaurants, and stores. Perfect place to stay."
4108,H10 London Waterloo,"Lovely hotel lovely room great location. From King’s Cross bus 63 outside takes u to the street behind the hotel. Great access to buses and sights. However NOT BABY FRIENDLY. For a public building there is no baby changing facilities the restaurant made it seem like an inconvenience that I had asked for a high chair. When it did come they were disgusting not even wiped down the straps were beyond disgusting that I couldn’t bare putting them around my baby. However without the straps the babies just slid right there the chairs as nothing between the legs to stop them falling out. No cot provided in room when asked. Also hairdryer worked for the whole of 2 seconds and I tried three different ones, towels had lipstick stains on all of them, pillow cases dirty. Breakfast…"
4109,H10 London Waterloo,"We chose this hotel as wanted a hotel that offered a few extra luxury touches within a moderate price range. London hotels are not always good unless spending a fortune . H10 Waterloo is the exception! It feels light, airy and modern. We had the standard room which was modern but small although spacious enough and felt larger than it probably was. The bathroom was modern and spacious with good quality fittings and bath / shower. H10 makes your stay feel a bit more special with lovely welcome treats and luxury quality bath products provided. The roof terrace is gorgeous especially if you are lucky with a sunny day like we had. Excellent staff who are very professional and friendly. The location is convenient to tube stations and walkable to the south bank area and beyond. We had…"
4110,H10 London Waterloo,"Great location close to underground stations and there are many restaurants and bars within an easy walking distance plus Westminster is only about 15 mins walk! Nice welcome drink on arrival and had surprise welcome gift of mini cakes. Room was spacious,well equipped and clean and modern. Could not fault one bit. Sky Bar was fab and such a great view from there. Will definitely stay here again and have now joined welcome club. My only 'complaint' and it's not their fault is that it's pretty close to the ambulance headquarters so during the night even when the roads are quiet you hear sirens (y when there is no traffic) so next time I will probably see if there is a quiet room available off from the main road."
4111,H10 London Waterloo,The room was excellent and very clean .Breakfast was fantastic so much choice and the staff were so helpful nothing was a problem to any of them they were so friendly and welcoming.The view from the sky bar was great so many landmarks just facing you
4112,H10 London Waterloo,"H10 Waterloo is a cosy boutique hotel, well located to Waterloo train station as well as Lambeth North underground. We caught the train from Heathrow airport and only had to change once to the Jubilee line and then walked from Waterloo underground to the hotel which took about 10 minutes. The hotel staff greeted us with a welcome drink and checked us in. It was busy when we arrived on 30th April for 3 nights. We had booked 1 deluxe room via a special website deal with H10 and then when my daughter said she would join us the hotel gave us a discount for a 2nd room for their double. We joined their loyalty program which provided us all with comp breakfast each day and 2 comp drinks in their Skybar - so well worth it. We had an early dinner at the Skybar and what a view! The rooms…"

4119,H10 London Waterloo,"The view was fantastic from my room, especially at night, found the room very clean and was suprised with the added extra petit fours and a cold bottle of cava waiting for us. Breakfast was superb, with a great variety on offer and the bonus of the station that offers freshley cooked omelettes made to order and the waffles are to die for. Skybar is a must, weather was kind to us when we visited, so was great to sit outside and enjoy the views. Highly recommend this hotel and will definitly return again on my next vsit from Gloucestershire"
4120,H10 London Waterloo,"I recently stayed at this hotel in London and had an incredible experience. The room was very clean, spotless and the views from the hotel were absolutely stunning. From our room and there is a very nice bar at the 8th floor , amazing views to the city the serve tapas and burgers but we didn't order any food at bar I was particularly impressed with the hotel's restaurant, which served Spanish food , from tapas to Iberian Pork Paella, the dishes were really authentic.and nice selection of Spanish Wines Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in London"
4121,H10 London Waterloo,"Love this hotel, always my first choice when visiting London, espescially the skybar.

4123,H10 London Waterloo,It’s a great choise to order a room with city vieuw. And the breakfast is splendid. And the candy’s at the reception also. And the cocktails in the bar. Plenty of options for bus and tube and train close to the hotel.
4124,H10 London Waterloo,I normally don't leave reviews but I want to share another great experience at this lovely weekend near Waterloo as I feel is not well known . Location is brilliant for central London and I loved to see they keep the good level of service. Room was sparkling clean with modern stylish decor (no old-fashioned furniture like in other London hotels we have stayed before) Wonderful views from the Sky Bar - even my hip London friends don't know about it and are always impressed! Totally recommended as it is hard to find this value in London
4125,H10 London Waterloo,"First trip to London with my daughter. Hotel located in a very good place, near from all the places we wanted to visit. The room was very comfortable and very clean (very important poin to me). The meals were carefully selected as i realised (I as spanish found quality food from my country) and i saw a big selection for the english and foreigners taste. So we enjoyed beautiful breakfasts every mornig. We ate twice am evening. We were surprise for the cooker abilities, meat perfect done, rice & fish too. We enjoyed a good time in London, just five days but it was a big success our hotel choose. We will return to the hotel next trip to London."
4126,H10 London Waterloo,"What a great place to stay in London. I arrived mid-morning, my room was ready! I had booked a city view. Had the perfect location on the top floor (1210). Great view, beautifully clean room, comfortable bed, good soundproofing from the road below. Great choices at breakfast. The rooftop bar had lovely views day & night. All of the staff were so friendly. Nothing was too much trouble - the reception team are great, they even helped me plan my days out & equipped me with maps & directions! The hotel is near to underground stations but there are so many places within walking distance - I hardly used public transport! Some of the theatres are within walking distance, as is Borough market, south bank, London Eye, Westminster, Big Ben and the imperial war museum. I recommend buying a…"
4127,H10 London Waterloo,A delightful clean contemporary hotel situated within walking distance of London’s main attractions. Tube & Rail links are close by and there’s even a bus stop within 100m. The staff are polite and friendly and the view from the roof garden is a treat not to be missed. Plenty of choice for breakfast in a light and airy restaurant but head to the omelette queue early as that can take 10mins or so. My only personal complaint would be that the pillows are on the thin side but that staff did provide extras on request so they still get an excellent review. We would definitely stay here again!!
4128,H10 London Waterloo,"Once again opted for H10 - has everything we want for a London visit- great rooms and well appointed , all facilities you need, fantastic Sky Bar ( food nibbles/snacks , cocktails, drinks and panoramic views) , excellent breakfast and all round great service . Really good location too , short walk from Waterloo , Came with two other couples who equally loved it and all now signed up members ! Till the next time ….."
4129,H10 London Waterloo,"Excellent hotel stay, from start to finish. We continue to choose to come back here because we can guarantee the experience will be perfect, every time. Again, it did not disappoint! We received the warmest welcome from the reception staff, our return visit was recognised by Valentina as well as it being a celebration and ensured we had a gorgeous room! Nothing was too much and we felt super special and taken care of which we appreciated enormously. We had welcome drinks and sweet treats on arrival, then off to our immaculate room with a stunning view (again, thank you Valentina!) The views from the Sky Bar were awesome and the bar staff were brilliant; super attentive and mixed excellent cocktails. An amazing sleep on the comfiest bed then an insane breakfast which was the…"
4130,H10 London Waterloo,"Stayed here for one night on a Friday as a post-theatre treat. We were warmly welcomed by the staff on the front desk and upgraded to a City view room which was much appreciated. The room was clean, bright and modern, with a good selection of toiletries in the bathroom and a great view from the large window. We didn't have time for a drink in the Sky Bar before heading out for a meal, but visited the terrace to check out the view from there too, which was even better! The hotel is very well located for all the South Bank venues and for the Old Vic. Breakfast doesn't end until a very civilised 11.30 at the weekend, and check-out isn't until 12, so my husband was able to go to the Southwark Park Run in the morning while I had a lie in! There was a very good selection at the…"
4131,H10 London Waterloo,I will start with the good . Restaurant and Rooftop bar staff were amazing! Nothing was too much trouble. They remembered who you were and what you liked and their service was 5 stars. The location was close to both Elephant Castle and Lambeth North stations and not far from Waterloo station either. We actually walked to most places but we prefer walking . If traveling with luggage there are some steps to navigate at both stations but manageable ( if you pack lightly or have someone strong to carry your oversized luggage 😂). Now for the not so good. The room was serviced well daily but the overall cleanliness was not great in particular the level of dust. Unfortunately what let the hotel down was the front of house ( reception) staff . I am not one to leave negative reviews…
4132,H10 London Waterloo,"Stayed for one night whilst visiting the US Embassy, hence picking a location on South Side of river. This is the first time I have stayed south of the river, and I found the location to have a very residential neighbourhood vibe. Plenty restaurants and bars close by, with excellent transport links. Hotel is very clean and all the staff are very professional and friendly. I paid to upgrade at check-in to a top floor city view room and was not disappointed. I arrived early just after 10 am and the desk staff were very accommodating. Breakfast was delicious 😋."
4133,H10 London Waterloo,"I was very impressed - located just a couple of minutes walk further away than other Bankside options. Part of a Spanish chain, the staff are all lovely. They smile and chat to you - that makes a real difference. The breakfast was unusually good and finished late, perfect if you’re not in a rush. The rooms are good, not flashy, but very comfortable. The Skybar was lovely, an oasis in the afternoon, with great views."
4134,H10 London Waterloo,"Great location. Nice breakfast. Room clean, a little bit small, but ok. Good place for business people. Staff are friendly and always ready for help. It was relaxed time."
4135,H10 London Waterloo,"We visited this hotel for 1 night as our hotel of choice while visiting london to watch a show. Great location. Overall, our stay was pleasant, the room was lovely and the views were stunning! We arrived just before 12 and were pleasantly surprised to find that out room was ready early. However, we did not get the welcome drinks we were expecting, nor were they mentioned, so we assumed that was not a service being offered anymore. We booked for 3 people, the room is supposed to be suitable for 3 people, we did not find this was entirely the case unfortunately. The room only had amenities for 2 people. 2 of each towel, 2 gowns, 2 mugs etc. We called down to reception to report this and the lady who answered the phone didn’t seem to understand what we were asking for, nor was…"
4136,H10 London Waterloo,"We had a one night stay at this lovely hotel. Arrived just before 12 on the Friday morning and luckily our room was ready. Reception staff really friendly and we were offered a welcome drink. Room on the 8th floor close to the sky bar. Really nicely appointed room super comfy bed Great facilities All the staff we encountered were lovely, and chatty and helpful. The breakfast was lovely to, and the restaurant was chilled and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay here. The sky bar is great with someone awesome views. The hotel is near loads of local transport links and loads of good quality bars and restaurants we would love to stay here again"
4137,H10 London Waterloo,"Very good location between the tube stations Waterloo and Elephant & Castle, and in walking distance of Tate Modern or the London Eye. Superb breakfast with Spanish and English touches. Great service, very friendly people, nice rooms. My favourite London hotel. Great rookftop bar."
4138,H10 London Waterloo,"Once again we had a super relaxing stay in this wonderful hotel. Every member of staff greets with a smile and a welcome, they are efficient and really know their jobs. Our city view room on the 9th floor was spotlessly clean with every amenity you might require and, as usual, the breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied. We also enjoyed a very pleasant snack lunch and a cocktail in the beautiful little Sky Bar with it’s swathes of windows and beautiful monkey wallpaper. Thank you to every member of staff who helped make our stay perfect and we cannot wait to return."
4139,H10 London Waterloo,"Just basic. Bed & pillows not the best. Some things in the room were tatty. Staff were friendly, but asked for extra milk, which we never got. Sky bar, service charge was ridiculously over price, so it put us off going in."
4140,H10 London Waterloo,"We love H10 hotels. We've stayed in a few H10s now in other countries and we came across this gem in the heart of London! The location is perfect for getting to most areas with ease. We stayed in room 203 which had big glass windows all around the room. It was spacious and bright. The amenities are wonderful. The hotel (and room) was very clean and smells lovely upon arrival. We ate breakfast whilst we stayed - which was fab! And we had drinks in the rooftop bar, which was lovely! Cannot thank you enough for another wonderful experience staying in a H10."
4141,H10 London Waterloo,"I stayed here on business in November and was so impressed I booked a two night stay for my husband. We were greeted at reception with a warm welcome and even though we arrived before check in, we were offered a complimentary drink and our room was ready. We had a London Eye view room. The complimentary welcome cocktails were very much appreciated as was the surprise bottle of bubbly and cakes. We weren't disappointed by this return visit. We walked into the city both days, taking about 30mins and enjoyed the opportunity to walk over Waterloo and Westminster bridges. Breakfast is well worth the money. A super selection of cooked items, fruit and pastries accompanied by great Nespresso coffee. A fabulous stay and we hope to return again soon."
4142,H10 London Waterloo,"The worst hotel of my life, where my stay has turned into a nightmare. Staying in room 214, the first night I found a small bug in my bed and I thought it was by chance. My stay was from February 12 to 17, and on Wednesday the 15th I had some pimples, I thought it could be an allergy. Every day that passed I got more, I have stopped eating almost everything. When I returned to Spain, all my hands were full of pimples - bites. Immediately, I went to the hospital and the doctor told me that they are bedbug bites, and probably that little bug that I found was not the only one. If you don't want to end up the same as me, I don't recommend staying at this hotel. And I hope they take action. Because it is essential that for the fee they charge, they put you up in the rooms with…"
4143,H10 London Waterloo,"Now our go-to hotel on the South Bank, the rooms are very comfortable and it is great to be welcomed to the hotel with a glass of Cava. As members of the H10 club we also get a cocktail in the lovely bar, which has a lovely terrace and great views of the London skyline."
4144,H10 London Waterloo,"We visited this hotel for 2 nights Friday and Saturday evening for my mums 60th birthday weekend to London. We arrived earlier than 3pm and reception were very friendly and helpful offering us welcome drinks to start. Only 1 of the rooms was available so we went for drinks in the rooftop bar. We were also given a complimentary drinks voucher to use in the bar. The sky bar is only small but very modern, chilled and serves very nice cocktails. After 3pm we went back down and there was a little confusion with the rooms as we had asked and told we had twin rooms however this had not happened. We went back down to reception and this was fixed immediately and they were very apologetic and offered us another voucher for the inconvenience. The bedrooms are small but are modern, clean…"
4145,H10 London Waterloo,"Spent 3 nights at H10 Waterloo and have no complaints. Wonderful staff, good location. Had a London Eye view room on 10th floor,size of room typical for London hotel but great use of space, quiet room and very comfortable bed. Location within 5 mins walking distance of London Waterloo station so easy access to all London sights. We had free breakfast included with our rate - buffet style loads of choice, items were all fresh and good quality. Would highly recommend H10 Waterloo for a London stay."
4146,H10 London Waterloo,"Having stayed in a few H10s in Spain, I was curious to see what it would be like in the UK. Everything felt very familiar, great service, comfy room with a great view of the city skyscrapers. The area is not exactly buzzing but you can walk to a few tourist spots or get the tube from Waterloo station."
4147,H10 London Waterloo,"Stayed here December a family trip for Christmas shopping, traveled to London on the train and the hotel was just a short walk from Waterloo station. lovely clean room with everything you need. Excellent breakfast variety with so much to choose. friendly helpful staff and house keepers. Hotel in a quiet location and only a short walk from a couple of stations. Return anytime."
4148,H10 London Waterloo,"This hotel is amazing, the staff were great and they couldn't do enough for you. Maria and her team in the breakfast restaurant were helpful and friendly. Room service was amazing, and they were always there if we needed anything. The reception team were absolutely brilliant they helped us with everything from extra tea bags to taxis and bus routes. Thank you so much to everyone at this hotel , uou made our stay one of the best we have ever had in london"
4149,H10 London Waterloo,"After a very bad and upsetting start to my stay, I really enjoyed this hotel and will stay again when in London. I joined Club H10 a few months before my stay and enjoyed a lovely stay at their Art Gallery Hotel in Barcelona. On my club profile my stay was showing as confirmed for the dates I had booked, but they had no record of my reservation on arrival. I showed them my booking but they asked for my e-mail confirmation and on checking my e-mails I had never received one from them. Well this is when the receptionist laughed and sneered at me blaming me for not having received my confirmation! Being told off and laughed at in public is really very embarrassing and at that point I honestly got the impression she wanted me to just go away. I insisted she call central reservations…"
4150,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel",My stay was amazing. I particularly loved the food options in the restaurant. I loved the customer service I got from Kajal. She was excellent. Ready to service with a big smile and a positive attitude. I felt welcomed.
4151,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel","We were booked here by British Airways as we were delayed and had missed our connecting flight. We arrived late evening after waiting nearly an hour for a shuttle bus at the airport, Terminal 5. The hotel was busy but we were checked in efficiently and we enjoyed a buffet style dinner. The interior of the hotel is lovely, and the rooms are comfortable and cosy, just what we needed after a hectic day of travelling. The showers are powerful, loved the shampoo etc in the bathrooms. The beds were really comfortable and the rooms were spotlessly clean and smelled lovely. We were very impressed overall."
4152,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel","Our stay at Crowne Plaza Heathrow T4 was truly wonderful. The staff members were terrific, striking the perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness. We were particularly impressed with the restaurant staff, who made every meal an enjoyable experience. Special mention goes to Kajal Sharma, who was exceptionally helpful during our breakfasts. Navigating breakfast with a toddler can be challenging, but Kajal made it feel like a breeze. Her patience and care added an extra level of comfort to our stay. Based on our exceptional experience, I would highly recommend Crowne Plaza Heathrow T4 to anyone looking for excellent service and a comfortable, stress-free stay."

We came for a trip to London for our first wedding anniversary and it was the best and most comfortable stay we have had. We were blown away by the kindness of the staff and the housekeeping was also amazing. Thank you Crowne Plaza for such a wonderful stay! Ps. The bed and room was so comfortable we actually slept through the alarm and we woke up 1 hour late the bed was so comfortable! The blackout curtains and the triple glazing meant the room was dark and quiet too. Thank you so much!"
4166,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel","Solid stay, convenient to Terminal 4. It is about a 7 min walk, albeit not crazy well marked from arrivals to hotel. The walk path from departures floor to the hotel is through a covered path which was nice. The hotel is big and is busy at all hours. The room was nicely appointed and despite having a club access room did not use the club room so can't comment on it. Breakfast was busy and seating could be tricky. The choices were good and had both hot and cold items. Wifi - good Cleanliness- good Price point - pretty good value for a major airport hotel Proximity to terminal 4 - great If you arw wanting to use this as a base to visit London. I would not advise this. It is about 45 mins by train to do so and there arw so many strikes you never know if the tube will…"

The building housed two separate hotels - Crowne Plaza & Holiday Inn Express ( which was around 46 GBP a night cheaper ). I paid the equivalent of 151 GBP in IHG Reward Points, but I could have kept those points, and paid a much lower cost at the HIE, as there was no real difference between the two. Being an IHG Diamond Member, I asked for an upgrade to their Club Lounge. Don't bother paying for a Club Lounge access room at this place ... It wasn't even worth my effort to walk there !! ( up the next floor, and a lengthy corridor walk ). Evening 'offering' considered of two 'hot' ( warm ) choices, one being vegan. Very basic frozen packet type food. Eg. Chicken pieces ( like 'nuggets' ). No sauces, and overly dried…"
4186,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel",Truly excellent & professional advice & service from Sandra at the Urban Restaurant in the T 4 Crowne Plaza. She gave great advice on the menu items and ingredients. She also displayed great knowledge of the ingredients in use in the kitchen.

4188,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel","We had an excellent night's stay after 24 hours of traveling from Australia to the UK. The staff were friendly and very accommodating from the moment we stepped up to the front desk. A very special thank you to Adriana, Kajal, and the staff who work at the Urban Brasserie located in the lobby of the hotel during the breakfast buffet. They were all very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. All in all, a great way to freshen up and to start our trip here in the UK."
4189,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel","Wonderful service! The food was amazing and always fresh. Having a great breakfast to look forward to every morning of our stay was a great way to wake up after a long day of sightseeing. Kamal Sharma, one of the waiters, remembered us from the beginning and asked about our days and was very pleasant. Wonderful dinning experience and highly recommend. Many food options."
4190,"Crowne Plaza London Heathrow T4, an IHG Hotel","Stayed here for one night, we booked a King Crowne Plaza Club Suite, Club Floor. Room was very spacious, nice comfy bed, mini bar, dressing gown and slippers etc. The club lounge was a nice touch, we popped in through the day and had a hot drink and some snacks, then went back in the evening and enjoyed the complimentary wine and beer with canapes. My partner is gluten and lactose intolerant so the canapes weren't suitable for him, we mentioned this to the waitress and she arranged for the kitchen to prepare something separate for him. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening, but we did have breakfast in the morning, which was very good. There was lots of choice and the hot food was hot! The walkway to Terminal 4 was great, no worries about catching a bus or a…"

Breakfast was nice too & we had the amazing service of Sheela. She does her job with pleasure, giving her clients personal service by suggesting options they might like. We had our very energetic toddler with us. She quickly came with special cutlery for him and suggested we could take something with us for him because he did not eat much, for later."
4200,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Had a fantastic family get together at the weekend for a special birthday celebration. A beautifully decorated hotel which is spotlessly clean. We had wonderful sea view rooms which felt very special indeed. The hotel is perfect for family and friends getting together. Access is available to a swimming pool at a sister hotel just a block or so away. The hotel is a 25 minute stroll along the promenade into the centre of Blackpool and is just across the road from a tram stop, making the centre easily accessible for the less able. The Elgin has the most amazing staff - nothing is too much trouble - they clearly enjoy being part of such a great team! Excellent food (at breakfast and dinner) and really professional entertainment in the evenings in two comfortable lounges. …"
4201,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,Just returned from a stay again at the Elgin. The only hotel that falls over its self to be as helpful as possible. We had a Executive room which was brilliant.

This is the only hotel that I've stayed in (including 5*) where there is no queueing for cereals and juices or starters at evening meals; no; everying is served at your table! Wow! Nigel is the jovial host that makes sure that all flows smoothly. The staff; food and entertainment (Elvis and Just John and Paul - Beatles tribute) were all good and the hotel is spotless. This was our first time at this hotel but intend that this hotel is the one we'll stay at in Blackpool in the future.
4206,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"This hotel is the absolute gem of Blackpool! I stayed with my parents, 18 month old daughter and my chihuahua. The hotel was very accommodating and they provided us with a travel cot and also a high chair at mealtimes. The restaurant staff are so helpful. A special shout-out to Arek who always makes sure we have a good meal, even if we don’t fancy the vegetarian option on the menu. He also always made sure my daughter had something she enjoyed to eat at meal times. The entertainment at the hotel is also brilliant. There is also bingo every night, which is a big bonus for me! This is our second time staying here and it certainly won’t be our last! Thank you to all the staff at the Elgin who make our holidays so special. Keep doing what you do so we’ll!"
4207,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Just back from a three night break in Elgin Hotel. My group consisted of 2 x 90 year olds (one in a wheelchair), a 9 year old, and me (forty something :/). From arrival the staff couldn’t do enough for us, all really helpful and friendly. We arrived early to ensure we got a parking space, but too early to go to the rooms. Our cases were taken up to the room while we went out for a few hours. Rooms were nice. Everything was spotlessly clean. Food was really lovely, no complaints from us at all and everything catered for (I’m a veggie). All waiter(ess ) service even for breakfast. Two bars with entertainment, bingo and quiz on both. Entertainers swap rooms after their set so you all get the same. Tam Ryan entertainer on Sunday night was great. Bus and tram stop right outside,…"

A special thank you to Maria the entertainment manager for making our anniversary so special. This is definitely our go to place whenever we can"
4215,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"After staying in many hotels in Blackpool I have found The Elgin to be the best. Beautifully decorated, fabulous friendly and helpful staff, meals that are tasty and well presented, and plenty of choices for everyone. The entertainment is fantastic. We stayed over Coronation weekend and the hotel provided TVs in every lounge, free Prosecco for a toast and afternoon teas for all with sandwiches, scones, strawberries and cream and cake. It made the afternoon so special. 10/10 to every member of staff who go all out to make your stay fabulous. Keep doing what you’re doing 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
4216,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"We had a lovely time . The staff are very helpful and the food was wonderful. Although the room we stayed in was comfortable, we found it small and would try to upgrade if we go again. The only thing that slightly spoilt it for us was the total lack of information on how to make the final payment. We received no final invoice or information from staff on arrival which did cause us some embarrassment. Would we go again ? Maybe with clearer information next time."
4217,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"It’s always a pleasure to stay at the Elgin Hotel. Spotlessly clean, food was delicious as always. Entertainment was excellent every evening. The staff throughout were their friendly, helpful and polite, it was particularly a sheer delight to be served each day in the restaurant by Ieva, who just couldn’t do enough for you. Carl in the bar was on excellent form too. We will return again. I also have to thank the receptionist, after realising we had left two draws full, she posted the items the same day, wonderful service all round. Thank you Elgin and Staff for another wonderful mini holiday."
4218,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Been staying at this hotel with family and friends since 2013. The staff are exceptional they go way beyond their call of duty nothing is to much trouble. Stayed in all different categories of rooms and never had a complaint, and I’m very fussy. The food is excellent and plentiful. Entertainment is of a very high standard. Wouldn’t consider staying anywhere else. Well done to all at the Elgin for maintaining excellent standards. Look forward to seeing you again in June."
4219,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"First time here, but can't fault it. Absolutely brilliant, from check in to check out staff can't do enough for you rooms are very clean and comfortable, and meal choices are great. Only slight criticism is that there are lots of coach parties in hotel which can be noisy, and meal times and entertainment times are geared towards them.otherwise great hotel. Going back soon."
4220,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,I have been coming here for the last 12 years sometimes 5 times a year. The staff and very friendly and efficient. Good entertainment. Meals are excellent. They have always made us feel very welcome. They are very accommodating when it comes to my food intolerances.
4221,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Did not want to come to Blackpool ,but after the first class stay in the Elgin Hotel I have booked again,to come for the first class food, the service we had it was excellent In the dining room ,the staff worked like clockwork . Nothing but praise for everyone. Congratulations to all concerned and for having a first class hotel"
4222,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Having previously stayed here, we chose to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary in the friendly surroundings of The Elgin, which just happened to fall at Easter. On arrival we received the expected warm greeting from reception. When we got to our room, there was a Happy Anniversary banner on the door, and once inside we found a lovely towel sculpture (pictured) with a little note wishing us a Happy Anniversary from the Hotel. Upon checking in, we were asked about any dietary restrictions. A form was completed, and the system worked well, with Tom the head waiter making sure I always received the correct (safe) food, which was always of a very good quality. This despite my dietary restriction not being one of the recognised allergens. Once again we were extremely well looked…"
4223,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"The Elgin Hotel has got to be one of the best I've stayed in Blackpool. The staff are so welcoming and friendly and helped make our break fantastic, especially Maria who is definitely a people person and a brilliant compere. Beautiful food served by our hard working server Or who always had a welcoming smile. The entertainment provided was fab and so professional. The hotel itself is tastefully decorated and feels like home from home. This was our first stay at the Elgin but it definitely won't be our last 😊"
4224,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"My wife and I stayed at the Elgin on the weekend 21st April 2023. The Elgin is a superb hotel to stay at. We were given a fabulous room on the second floor, (232) which was spotlessly clean and had everything you want in a hotel room-------------everything that is, apart from a shaver point in the bathroom. But, all wasnt lost, a trip to reception and a quick chat with Susan and the problem was resolved, in the guise of a travel plug. I would like to be able to say something negative about our stay but I can't. Staff, brilliant, Food, brilliant, Entertainment ,great. And if that wasn't enough, our stay included Sunday lunch. We will definatly be back. Thank you Elgo."

Keep up the good work & see you at Air Show weekend in August."

Thank you for everything. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. See you again soon. Peter and Lynne."
4230,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Absolutely amazing Hotel. From checking in to leaving. The staff are absolutely wonderful. The hotel is extremely clean, comfortable and welcoming. I've never known a hotel managing director come around and speak to all of its guests, to be so kind and caring of their stay. Nigel, however always checks on you. How is your stay? How are you enjoying your meals? Is everything ok for you? Are you warm enough? just to mention some of his questions. This makes everyone feel at home and comfortable knowing how much Nigel cares. This exceptional caring attitude is passed down to all of his staff too. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at The Elgin Hotel Blackpool. To mention a few staff during our stay who made our stay so amazing. Nigel, Maria, Joseph, Ieva, Leanne, Carl, Tom,…"
4231,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Just returned from our 2nd visit to the Elgin, and it will not be the last.

4239,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"We visited the Elgin hotel over the Easter weekend and met up with family and friends staying there. We had dinner bed and breakfast. The hotel is immaculate, beautifully decorated throughout and offers excellent value for money for a stay in Blackpool. The location on the promenade is perfect. Food and drinks were excellent and good value for the quality offered. We enjoyed the evening entertainment organised by the hotel for the Easter break, it really was great fun! I would highly recommend this hotel and look forward to a return visit in the future. Thank you to all of the staff who really give the hotel a wonderful personal touch."
4240,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,"Stayed here for the Easter Weekend with two friends, then joined by 3 members of the family on Easter Sunday until Monday. Beautiful hotel right on the seafront. Fabulous staff everywhere who cannot do enough for you. Spotlessly clean,beautifully decorated, everything A1. The food is excellent, and you only have to ask if you want to change anything, and it’s done. Tom the Restaurant Manager is such a lovely guy, nothing too much trouble. Lovely outdoor area, with plenty of seating. The Star of the hotel is Maria, who organises and oversees the Entertainments. Such a lovely bubbly lady, who has everyone joining in the fun and games. We have been to the Turkey & Tinsel at the Elgin in the past, and their sister hotel, the Sheraton a few doors away, under the same ownership,…"

4249,Elgin Hotel Blackpool,Our first time atthis hotel and what a pleasure it was staff very helpful entertainment excellent and food was first class we have stayed in a few good hotels in Blackpool but this was the best by far don't go anywhere else this is the one to stay
4250,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"I went to the Forest Park Country Hotel with my wife and baby. It started well with a very warm welcome from reception. Our room was pleasant and clean but unfortunately we were placed at the front of the hotel facing the main road and right next to the store cupboard which the cleaners use. So in the morning, I was woken up by the delivery lorries and the cleaners using the store cupboard. The bathroom was nice but unfortunately the same can't be said for the shower. It had such low pressure that you were unable to have a nice shower. At the price you pay for the hotel stay, you'd expect a power shower at least. We had dinner at the hotel in the evening and the food was excellent. What really disappointed me and is a real bugbear of mine is the tipping process. I always like to…"
4251,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Unfortunately we found the hotel not very child friendly. Didn't offer a large variety of meals for children, not all children want chicken nuggets, sausages and burgers. When ordering our meal we asked for the children's meals to come out first. Only 3 out of the 5 children's meals arrived leaving 2 children without meals until the adult arrived. Long wait between main and desserts. Room was clean but very dark. Beds were very hard not comfortable."
4252,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"The hotel is surrounded by a vast expanse of New Forest which is wonderful for jogging or walking. It is 10 minutes by foot to Brockenhurst village centre. This amazing location makes the hotel a bit pricey. The restaurant is very good - well cooked food and an interesting menu. Sunday roasts are a great feast and good value for money. My double room was smallish, but very comfortable bed, bathroom, daily service, also nice lighting. Thoroughly recommended for a country break."
4253,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Drove a very long way to get there but it was worth it. The room was lovely, the staff were helpful, relaxed, friendly and smiling! Food delicious. Great wine list. Super venue for family get togethers. We will be back"
4254,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"An excellent hotel in a beautiful location. Every member of staff was friendly, helpful and worked well as a team. Nothing was too much trouble and this made for a really enjoyable stay. The food at breakfast and dinner was really good and served in a really nice restaurant. My wife is coeliac so needs gluten free meals. There was plenty of choice and they could adapt meals to suit if necessary. The hotel has been tastefully refurbished whilst retaining the character of the building. There were choices of bedrooms. Ours was on the second floor with a sitting room and steps down to the bedroom. I would suggest contacting the hotel to make sure that you get a suitable room if you have any mobility issues. There is a lift to all floors. The garden was superb with lots if…"
4255,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"An excellent hotel offering a small 'country house hotel' vibe (more of an upmarket 'Country Inn') Friendly staff (to name Hayley, Oliver, Dominque as examples) The public rooms are very good. Bedrooms are also good, but some are a bit small Overall...highly recommended"
4256,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"very good location , the bedroom has a nice decoration and comfortable. The vintage radio is amazing and very pleasant. Just we regret that there is not blackout curtain and a little noisy because the bedroom was on a road side"
4257,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Amazing long weekend spent at this hotel, Staff were absolutely fantastic , so helpful nothing too much trouble . Hotel & surrounding were beautiful. Most days there will be either horses or cows just strolling along the road outside hotel . Brokenhurst town just a short stroll down the road . Definitely highly recommended place to stay ."
4258,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"What a find this hotel was, we were greeted by Mandie on front desk such a friendly lady who obviously knows the job backwards and nothing was to much trouble, we were checked in in no time and on our way to our room. We chose the suite beautiful room spotlessly clean with a fantastic bathroom and a small balcony overlooking the wonderful grounds.We had breakfast and evening meal all cooked to perfection again the restaurant was very clean at all times.as were all the public areas.The staff are a fantastic group of very hard working people always greet you with a smile genuinely friendly lovely people.so to all at the hotel thank you for making our stay special we will definitely be coming back 10/10"
4259,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Stunning property that makes a pleasant change from large chain hotels. The property is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. It sits in well manicured grounds with secluded outdoor area for alfresco drinks and food. The breakfast is outstanding and the staff are so happy and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for a stay, lunch, dinner or drinks."
4260,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,Thoroughly enjoyed the stay at Forest Park. Perfect location within New Forest. Just crossed the road to head for a great Forest walk and did a 10k walk to Lyndhurst one day. Service can get better in the lawn area. Very friendly and welcoming team.
4261,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"the hotel is accessible, if you are looking for a place to stay that gives a peaceful and calming feel this hotel is the place. Nice music in the restaurant, the garden is good place to spend time to have good conversations and just chill."
4262,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"First visit to the hotel as previously we'd always felt we needed a pool and spa when going away. So happy that we decided it wasn't important this time. The hotel staff were lovely, the location is super quiet yet within walking distance of Brockenhurst town centre and on great road connections for exploring the forest. Bar was well stocked, breakfast was very good. Dyson hair drier in the room was a revelation for my wife, and has cost me £400 as she wants one now. We will be back :)"
4263,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"A lovely hotel in a perfect setting in the New Forest let down by an unreliable restaurant. The first night was an excellent dinner - definitely not cheap but worth the money. The second night I can only assume was the chef’s night off! The soup of the day was actually the same as the soup of yesterday and there were no specials tonight for main course. No problem, I ordered a fillet steak medium rare. When it arrived it was on the burnt side of well done- inedible! The replacement took so long to arrive that I cancelled completely. An evening spoilt. 5 star prices should be accompanied by 5 star service but the service and the food are 3 star standard. After the first night I was going to recommend the hotel to friends. After the second night I wouldn’t recommend it to…"
4264,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We stayed here for 7 days and enjoyed it immensely. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was excellent, lovely walk in shower. The food was marvellous. Breakfast was excellent. Plenty of choice and lovely service. We had lunch which was brilliant. The hotel is in a lovely situation. Nice walkable distance to the village shops. The garden is a lovely sun trap. Overall our visit was brilliant"
4265,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Chose Forest Country Hotel as we were looking for dog friendly place for a weekend away and we couldn’t have wished for a better place to stay - the place is wonderful, situated a walk away in one direction from Brockenhurst village and in the other direction beautiful open fields with wild horses and cows grazing just wonderful. Hotel is clean, comfortable and team are extremely helpful and friendly. Couldn’t have asked for anywhere better, even down to leaving treats for our doggy - would certainly recommend and we’ll definitely be back"
4266,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We have stayed at the Forest Park 3 times in the last 18 months, and there was a difference this time. The menu is pretty basic for dinner and the same as when we last visited. We noted the gardens are no longer so well kept. Guess that’s the problem when a group takes over and contract gardeners replace the local good ones. Weeds in flower beds, roses looking sad and lawn not so great. Service at breakfast and dinner was excellent when Izzi and Hayley were working, other time dinner was really not the same, Thursday we both ordered main courses that had run out, my wife two options in fact. Would have been easier to say what was left, or just suggest we eat out. Saturday evening, we were asked if we wanted a dessert menu, we said yes and then waited 10-15 mins, even then we…"
4267,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"A lovely stay for my birthday. Staff are all so lovely. Our room was a fabulous size and comfortable with it. The hotel is in a fabulous position for exploring the New Forest and great too to walk to the Station for trains to Lymington, Bournemouth and beyond. The food and especially the breakfasts were, like the staff, fabulous."
4268,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"i found the whole experience of staying for my wife's special birthday weekend a great experience and would highly recommend ,food and staff very pleasurable. flowers left in room as requested for our arrival."
4269,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We are regular visitors to the forest but have never stayed at the Forest Park before. Our stay was brilliant and ticked all the boxes for a relaxing and memorable stay away. Welcome at reception was very warm and welcoming. Our room (108) was clean and comfortable. All staff were friendly and helpful. The gardens and outdoor area are perfect for a drink after dinner, or as we did, on arrival too!! The food was delicious and a good portion size. If I had to make one comment it would be the Red Wine Jus needs a little work. The steak was cooked perfectly but the red wine jus a little disappointing. This isn't enough to put us off as we are keen to come back soon. Thanks and we'll done to the team"
4270,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Our first lunch while staying at the forrest park hotel. While staying at this hotel we decided to try a dining experience, so we chose to have lunch. A marvellous time at the hotel situated in a deep and remote village in the new forest. Animals such as donkeys, horses,cattle and many more natural wild animals are allowed to roam free, and take priority over cars etc."
4271,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"My parents hosted a function in one of the private function rooms for 20 family and friends and we all had a wonderful time. The food was delicious and the service was faultless. We want to say a big thank you to Hayley who couldn’t have done more for us, truly an amazing hostess."
4272,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,We weren’t expecting much but were delighted with the hospitality and the quality of food both at breakfast and in the restaurant in the evening. Text book scrambled eggs and one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. The staff are utterly charming and friendly. We will certainly return.
4273,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,We were attending an event at Beaulieu and decided at last moment to stay away we found Forest Park advertising and decided to book. We were greeted well and everything was explained to us in detail. We were given a very nice room which was clean and presented well tho few cobwebs on ceiling around light fittings but that’s being picky. Breakfast was lovely and a good selection of hot and cold dishes.
4274,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Not the easiest hotel to find but well worth the effort. All the staff were friendly and efficient. Pleasant garden, plenty of off road parking. Excellent meals both evening and breakfast. The choice at breakfast was very impressive. Buffet bar or full English. Overall I would highly recommend a visit to this Hotel."
4275,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"I booked this hotel for mine and the husbands 40th birthday weekend and we splashed out and booked the superior room. My goodness 😍 definitely worth the money! The grounds are lovely, the staff are very friendly and welcoming and the position of the hotel is amazing. Lots of easy-hard walking from just outside the hotel gates. I can only think of 1 little thing (which made us laugh rather than get cross) that we challenged the waiter about... Which was the red wine jus which is an option for the steak. It was definitely gravy from the roast not jus 🤣 tasted lovely though! We have recommended the hotel to lot's of people and we are hoping to bring our older children next time."
4276,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Another very enjoyable evening, the staff are very friendly and welcoming, nothing is to much trouble to make it a special time. The wine selection and quality is a very good standard. The food is very good indeed, the menu offers a great variety. The food is of a high standard, not just s typical pub, this place is of a higher standard than others near by.. Presentation is very good, the quality is very good and flavours are very good. Definitely recommend to others when in the area. For the high standards we have chosen to have our wedding ceremony and dinner here. Phill & Jenny Southampton"
4277,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Couldn't fault a thing. First class. Attentive staff who went out their way to make you feel welcome. Spacious, clean rooms. Lovely dining area overlooking beautiful garden. First class breakfast. Its the first hotel I've stayed in that offers so many gluten free, dairy free, vegan & vegetarian options for breakfast!!"
4278,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"This is an absolutely lovely hotel. It's beautifully decorated, our room was bright and very well appointed. The fixtures and fittings were way above standard. So many nice little touches, even a plastic duck on the bath shelf !The staff were all very smiley and friendly. We ate in the restaurant which looks out onto the lovely gardens. The food was delicious and served by friendly and attentive staff. Next time we visit the New Forest, the Forest Park Hotel will be our first choice for accomodation."
4279,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We have stayed on a number of occasions at this hotel, to be honest there is no one better for the price, service, friendliness of staff and location. As dog owners we struggle to find nice places to stay that really valve both the person and dog but the Forest Park does! Walks directly from the door into the New Forest whatever the weather. Great place!"
4280,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,Really excellent and efficient staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Lovely breakfast with plenty of variety of food. All cooked to order. Very spacious bedroom and bathroom. This hotel is very well situated in the heart of the New Forest and it has plenty of parking too! . We are so pleased we found it. The management should be really pleased with them selves that they have made this hotel so welcoming and comfortable. We will definitely be returning!
4281,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,Unfortunately we could only stay one night but it was my husband's birthday and they gave us a lovely room overlooking the gardens. I had asked for a bottle of champagne to be in the room on arrival and there it was will a lovely card from the hotel. The staff are wonderful especially the lady on reception who greeted us on arrival. Dinner in the restaurant was delicious but breakfast was a little disappointing as our eggs were very over cooked and dry. I'm sure it was just a blip. Would we stay again - definitely! Thank you.
4282,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"To be greeted with a complementary upgrade was a bonus. Excellent csutomer service across all departments. Only downside was tea quality. Good sized pots, but not enough teabags initially to make a decent cuppa'. Even doubling up quantities wasn't enough to produce much improvement in flavour - local provided (Forest Teas) is a very mild blend - and we weren't looking for ""Builders"" tea. Other locally sourced produce was very good."
4283,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Such a lovely place with great welcoming staff. Having changed ownership since we last stayed, we were delighted to see familiar faces and that the hotel hasn’t changed. Comfortable rooms and wonderful dining experience. We’ll be back soon!"
4284,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"My partner and myself had a lovely stay at the Forest park country hotel, we arrived late afternoon had a few drinks in the lovely garden then took a walk in the beautiful local area . Arrived back to the hotel for a lovely evening meal then had a couple more drinks before retiring to our room . The staff were great , the hotel was beautifully decorated, clean and well equipped. I can’t wait to go back"
4285,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We needed a break , forest park country hotel gave us both all we could ask for, stay,food,atmosphere,room all excellent,I have just got my mum and step dad to book for may, they will love it as much as we did 🥳🥳"
4286,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Really enjoyed again our short stay at the Forest Park with our dogs. The service, food and staff in general all excellent . Would highly recommend especially those guests who are taking a dog with them and want easy garden access."
4287,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"I can't begin to recommend this hotel enough. It sits in a beautiful setting & is a hotel finished to a high standard. From the minute we phoned the hotel until we left, the staff were so friendly & efficient. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are lovely. Beds are very comfortable. We took our dog. The hotel was fantastic. They thought of everything. Dogs bowl at door, dog biscuits at tables, bowls in room, etc. This is an outstanding hotel & cuts no corners. The food was lovely too. Well worth a visit. You will not be disappointed."
4288,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"The hotel adheres to very high standards and we felt relaxed staying there again. The location is excellent for the New Forest. We had booked a small double room, which had all the required facilities and was well layed out. Quiet at night, so we slept well in a very comfortable bed. The breakfast menu was excellent. We would stay there again."
4289,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"As a family of 4, little toddler in tow, the team were very accommodating and pleasant at all times. The staff were friendly, approachable and interactive with the little one. I really enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to return. The food in the evening was sensational, hats off to the chef as all of us really enjoyed the evening meal in the restaurant. The hotel is rather warm on the 2nd floor, certainly at night. Too warm for me but I'm sure it would be OK for most. The breakfast was great but there's a little room for improvement. Overall, a really good hotel and one I've already shared with friends and family looking to visit Brokenhurst."
4290,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,The Staff at Forest Park are exceptional. They go out of their way to make you comfortable and nothing is too much trouble. The food was excellent too . I enjoyed my stay very much and highly recommend staying there.
4291,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Liked this hotel so much that we have booked another long weekend! Service is excellent, rooms which allow dogs provide beds and treats for the dog as well. Dogs can dine in the large, lovely bar area with you. The room was immaculate very day despite our long hair, large dog. These rooms are ideally located on the ground floor with two doors-one to the outdoors and one to the inner hallway. This was ideal for late evening walks! Food is very good. Best part is the location, immediately facing woods and plain. We left the car behind for two days and did some lovely walks!"
4292,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We spent the day at The Forest Park Hotel celebrating the birthdays of two elderly aunts. What a superb experience we had! The personnel went out of their way to look after us and did everything they could to accommodate our requests. The food was wonderful, I have nothing negative to say. An exceptional venue with exceptional value for money. Whole heartedly recommended!"
4293,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"We stayed for 2 nights over the Easter weekend at this lovely hotel. The service, food and location was excellent. The staff were very friendly and gave us plenty of advice of where to visit during our stay. We will definitely visit again. Thank you."
4294,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,Stayed 6-9 April 23 Upon arrival we received a warm friendly welcome from two very cheerful and helpful ladies which is all ways a good start and provides a good indicator of what is to come. Throughout our stay we found all staff without exception to be friendly helpful and polite especially towards our Labrador . We ate dinner every day in the hotel in the dog friendly bar area and found the food to be really excellent with a good choice and the seating well laid out without being too close to other diners. The breakfast choice was also exceptional with a great choice both at the buffet and from the cooked breakfast menu. Our bed was very comfy and the room (7) was quiet and had direct access to the outside garden ideal for our dog. There is virtually direct access to the…
4295,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"The property, with enough car park spaces, is maintained to a very high standard. Rooms are excellent, breakfast sumptuous and above all, friendly and helpful staff (shout out to Izzi who took care of our table on 2 of 3 breakfast occasions) - sharing local insights and offering tips on sightseeing."
4296,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"To Kevin & Staff at FPH. A huge Thankyou for making our Wedding Day at the Hotel so very perfect. From the moment our Guests arrived to lights out everything was wonderful. Guests commented on how special they were made to feel. A particular mention to the Chef and his team truly superb food. Staff are Professional, Friendly, and Warm with nothing being to much trouble. Kevin on a personal note a big Thankyou from both of us for accommodating all our never ending requests with a smile. Denise & Mark"
4297,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,We could not have been more impressed with the staff and service provided by Forest Park. Nothing was too much trouble and our event was managed to perfection. The presentation of the Forest cream tea was amazing we will sample again without doubt.
4298,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"Beautiful place and excellent service, we highly recommend this hotel. Gorgeous Location and very good food. The hotel is well set up to cater for either Couples of families and the staff were so friendly and helpful and did not mind at all when we made dinner reservations and had to change them!"
4299,Forest Park Country Hotel & Inn,"This is a lovely hotel in a beautiful setting, staff are lovely and helpful and friendly, would definitely visit again, food is of very high quality, there is a lovely atmosphere in the hotel and very lovely walks to be had in the forest."
4300,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Lovely hotel, friendly staff and delicious food. We enjoyed a three course meal and portions were huge, piping hot and very tasty! Room had a great view of beach and town. Everyone we met was friendly. I’m sad to leave."
4301,The Park Hotel Tenby,"I booked this hotel on the excellent trip advisers reviews, but did not feel the love for the place, like I’d previously read. The one thing I did agree on was the breakfast, it was delicious! Plus the staff were very professional and polite. The views were fantastic from the outside seating area ( not doable in January) There are clearly substantial rooms with the clear view of Tenby town, all depends on your budget. I clearly had the budget room, The walls were VERY thin and could hear our neighbouring guest at all times! He was a very loud snorer, I asked receptionist if they supply earplugs, I was told no but Tesco sell them. My husband and myself felt extremely tired driving home on Sunday morning, and couldn’t wait to get some sleep. The radiator had a lock on it, so…"
4302,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We stayed during the English October half term as a family of three. Staying in a hotel was a bit of a departure from the norm for us, as we tend to do self catering. We would absolutely stay here again. The hotel decor is to a very high standard and the service encompasses all the traditional values of a family owned hotel. The family room we stayed in was comfortable, the sun terrace provided a lovely place to sit and read (snooze), and the garden bar was unexpectedly funky. What really makes 5is place is the staff. They are so obviously proud of where they work and enjoy what they do. So lovely to stay with a team that make you so welcome."
4303,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We stayed in a family room for 2 nights the photos through the booking site looked fantastic but the reality wasn't, I have never been in such a grey dull interior in my life, grey/beige/black everything, where is the colour? The receptionist when we arrived was not helpful and had no customers service charm what so ever. The room was a good size with an amazing view but it was tired, the chairs/table were sticky the beds looked like the 3 bears had slept in them, the complimentary water was welcomed. We were woken both mornings by the next door guest in his bathroom coughing up his lungs! The bathroom was tiny with a rubbish shower over the bath, run off the taps!!!! The complimentary toiletries were cheap and poor quality. The quality of ingredients at breakfast was…"
4304,The Park Hotel Tenby,We stayed for 5 nights in this great town . The staff at every interaction we so happy and helpful you could not wish for a better experience . The breakfast is superb with plenty of choice and the view from our room was the best we have ever had . The outside Deck overlooking the north beach and harbour was great for evening drinks - even in October .
4305,The Park Hotel Tenby,"This hotel is a gem. Lovely friendly staff who go out of their way to make your stay perfect. Spotlessly clean throughout, fantastic views as well as a swimming pool. Far enough out of Tenby not to be noisy, but close enough to walk to town centre & harbour. Lovely breakfasts with more than enough choice & the option to have a meal in the restaurant in the evening which are also very good. We had a standard room which overlooked the pool & was perfectly adequate for our needs. Can’t really find anything to complain about & would have no hesitation in recommending"
4306,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We have reached that age where we enjoy short breaks so Monday 19 September we drove to Tenby for a 2 night break. The room was very smart, good bathroom/shower, twin beds and a good view over the harbour. Food was simply wonderful. Just main course and desert which was Fillets of Bass followed by Blackberry Pie and my wife had Welsh Beef Curry followed by Fundge Cake. The second evening meels was even better. All the food was cooked perfectly and was washed down with an Australian Chardonnay. Cost was very reasonable for this standard and the staff were delightful. We shall be back again for another stay and a sit in the gardens enjoying the view."
4307,The Park Hotel Tenby,Could not ask for a more welcoming hotel nothing was a problem. Everywhere was clean and well presented. The restaurant was a very pleasant experience great food sensibly price. Lovely outdoor area for drinks. Room was well equipped and plenty of space very close to the town centre. Get there early if you want a parking space on site is my only comment
4308,The Park Hotel Tenby,"What a lovely hotel we have just stayed at. Perfect base for Tenby and surrounding area. Very clean, nicely decorated. Staff are very friendly and helpful especially the restaurant staff (they could train people they are so polite)! Very tasty breakfast with and amazing choice. Was so nice not to have to wait in a self service like some hotels. Dinner was delicious too, so good we ate there 4 evenings. Can recommend the Welsh beef curry. The garden bar for after dinner is a must. Beautiful views and lots of places to sit outside weather permitted. You can even walk down to the beach at low tide. We weren't brave enough to use the outdoor pool. Best Hotel we have stayed at in the UK. Definitely will be staying again in the future. Love the querky little lift."
4309,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Hotel is clean, and was cleaned each day of our stay. Staff were friendly, helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We were particularly pleased that bar snack evening meals were fairly priced, unlike prices charged for meals in several town centre pubs."
4310,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We really enjoyed our 3 night stay here. The hotel is in a fantastic location and the views are stunning. I loved drawing the curtains in the morning to look out at Tenby harbour. Our room (304) was huge and had two seating areas. The bed was super comfy and the room was spotless. We ate in the hotel restaurant and the garden bar, and enjoyed both. The hotel’s tropical garden was lovely to sit in with a G&T, and my teenagers really enjoyed coming back from the beach and leaping into the hotel’s swimming pool. For peak season I thought it was good value for money. I’ll definitely be back as I would love to bring my husband and walk the coastal path with him. Highly recommended."
4311,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay with our Grandson. It's so hard to find a good quality hotel in Wales these days. This hotel was absolutely perfect, beautifully kept inside and outside. The decor of the hotel was outstanding, everything we experienced was of 1st class, beautifully furnished, decorated and extremely well kept. The gardens are immaculate too, so well kept, different areas with beautiful garden furniture and stunning views to sit and have your pre dinner drinks! There is also a good size outdoor warm, spotlessly clean swimming pool with a nice patio area. We have been very lucky as the weather allowed us to enjoy this hotel to the full. There are 2 sittings for breakfast, we chose the 9.30am 2nd sitting. We were greeted by super friendly staff who…"
4312,The Park Hotel Tenby,"My boyfriend and I have just stayed here for the week. The hotel was very clean. Our room always smelt so clean when we came back from our adventures. We had a room with a view of the sea. Tea, coffee and milk was replenished. Room came with a tv and hairdryer and toiletries in the bathroom. Breakfast was served to you. Lots of choice and very nice. Tenby itself is lovely. With beautiful beaches, little shops and places to eat. Thank you 💗"
4313,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We went to Tenby after a 3 year forced break. This hotel was recommended to us and it proved to be the best recommendation ever. The hotel is very comfortable and exceptionally clean. The staff could not have been more friendly and made sure we enjoyed our stay. Our room had a fabulous view over Tenby harbour and was very spacious. Breakfast was excellent with choices of full cooked breakfast and/or vegetarian which pleased our family. The Garden Bar served meals during the day and we ate the a couple of evenings meals there which were very enjoyable. We also had an evening meal in the Dinning room which we all enjoyed. Our girls made full use of the outdoor pool which added to our enjoyment of the hotel. We can recommend this hotel without any reservation, a marvelous find."
4314,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Reception was so-so, but on-site parking was fine. Communal areas smart, restaurant spacious and the staff there were friendly & efficient. We thought it odd, on checking in, that we had to specify what sitting we wanted for breakfast - 8-9.15 or 9.30. But it worked fine, all food and drink served at our table, and it was freshly cooked and decent quality. The rules didn't end there, we booked dinner one night and had to place our food order in advance. But again, the food and service were very good. Easily the worst aspect of the hotel was the room, a superior double that cost as much as a mid-price London hotel. It was small, with cheap fittings, and a bed that bounced every time one of us moved - even if another guest walked heavily past the room. The bathroom (shower over…"
4315,The Park Hotel Tenby,"The location of this hotel with its spectacular view of the iconic Tenby Harbour, along with its beautifully presented grounds and facilities make it an excellent setting for a relaxing week's holiday or a short stay. (It is a short walk from the town: ten minutes down, a little longer coming back up!) There is some onsite park as well as Street parking nearby. We saw some guests getting Taxis back up from Tenby, I am certain that the Reception staff would help with that. Our classic double was spotlessly clean with the added bonus of a sea and harbour view. The staff work relentlessly to keep the whole hotel spotless. They work in the restaurant and bar too and are always so smiley, helpful, efficient and kind. They really are a credit to the hotel - nothing is ever too much…"
4316,The Park Hotel Tenby,just got back from a 5day break there what a place could not fault anything the staff were all great the food was really good we did eat there for dinner also great menu room was really good only bad point was the shower not that great
4317,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Katie and the team are possibly the kindest, most caring people I've ever met when it comes to hospitality. We knew we were going to have a good time from the minute we arrived. Kate had rejigged our booking so we could all be in a family room together. And in doing so she saved us hundreds of pounds. ""Good start"" I thought. Things only got better. We were shown the garden bar while the housekeeping forensically prepared our room for an earlier than expected check in. We ordered from the lunch menu and checked several pints of San Miguel for poison. Thankfully, none of them were poisoned and were very, very tasty. As I take my role of poison tester very seriously, I made sure to continue testing it throughout our stay. Kate was also working the garden bar as well as the main…"
4318,The Park Hotel Tenby,"My daughter and I are leaving today as we spent 5days here, absolutely best hotel by far!! Rooms clean and tidy all staff are truly amazing especially the two ladies on reception so helpful in every way... Breakfast they have great viriaty all so tasty.. Wel be back at some point in *2023*"
4319,The Park Hotel Tenby,Overpriced for what was on offer. Our ‘superior’ room 108 was still very small and the en-suite was the absolute minimum area possible. Anyone with even marginal disability might struggle in the space. This room is located directly above a ground floor lounge with music speakers located in the ceiling immediately below. This created annoying background noise to the room until it was switched off around 11-00pm. Instant coffee in the room rather than a capsule machine is now low rent at this price level. The reception staff person was sometimes not at the desk and one of them seemed to be engaged in a personal call about a family members insurance in front of residents waiting for attention. Breakfasts were in two shifts and while the staff were all very pleasant and obliging…
4320,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Our stay at the Park Hotel, with it's stunning clifftop views of Tenby and ample free parking a short walk from the town, was exceptional. The outdoor pool was heated to a very comfortable temperature and the garden with it's gorgeous topiary was the perfect spot to relax on a sun lounger and read a book post-swim. Tip: There is no pool-side shower and I used my own beach towel, though the hotel is happy for you to use your room towel then get it changed. The hotel has an outdoor sitting area overlooking Tenby North Beach with terrific views. It's a perfect spot for a sunset cocktail at the end of the day, or a pot of tea. It's well protected from any breezes. Breakfast was plentiful and served at the table. I had coffee, orange juice, a full vegetarian breakfast with toast,…"
4321,The Park Hotel Tenby,Just back from four days at the Park Hotel Tenby. Very good hotel excellent location.well maintained gardens excellent views of Tenby and beaches Staff pleasant and nothing too much trouble. Try for a room overlooking the harbour. Restaurant good for evening meal plenty of choice. Well worth a look
4322,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We enjoyed our stay at The Park Hotel Tenby. If the Bay View room is available, book it! The view is amazing! Our kids stayed in the one room that can sleep 3 people. It was small, but okay for kids. I wouldn't put 3 adults in that room. If you use conditioner, make sure to pack it as that wasn't provided. This hotel is in a nice location walking distance to town. Overall, it was a good value for the price. We enjoyed the views and location."
4323,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Revisiting Tenby after 40 years and could not have chosen a better spot. The hotel has the most perfect position, parking available and the staff are just lovely. This was a last minute booking and we were made so welcome. The hotel was pristine, the bed comfortable and the breakfast was delicious!"
4324,The Park Hotel Tenby,Lovely hotel. Our room was really comfortable and spotlessly clean. Comfortable beds and plenty of wardrobe space. Breakfast I couldn't fault. We didn't use all the facilities but there is an out door swimming pool which looked really nice. The views from the hotel are spectacular. Very pleasant staff .Really satisfied with service .
4325,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We loved our stay at The Park Hotel. I had trouble with my booking .com reservation so I spoke directly with the hotel, Anita & Claire could not have been more caring & helpful. That service continued when we arrived , when we couldn’t find a parking space, Anita ran out & moved cars to accommodate us. The room was very clean & comfortable. Breakfasts included were good & big! We enjoyed our dinners there & the convenience of the option to just eat at the hotel. The mussels were amongst the best I’ve ever had & Tracy our waitress noting my enjoyment brought me a spoon each meal for me to slurp up the broth. I don’t remember all the names of the staff but each person I engaged with was as lovely as could be. The hotel has pretty fitting areas inside and outside and a bar & dining…"
4326,The Park Hotel Tenby,"My friend and I have just spent a 4 day break at this lovely old hotel on the sea front in Tenby. All the staff were extremity nice and accommodating, nothing was to much trouble . Our room was clean and the bathroom very modern. There was no maid service due to covid but if we needed anything all we needed to do was ask and it was provided. The restaurant was very nicely 'done out' bright and airy and the tables widely spaced. There was a good selection on the menu too. For the hot breakfasts you could choose the items you wanted and how they were to be cooked. The chef did a mean poached egg. The evening meals offered a good choice across the board. The range of wines they offered was also good. They have a bar area in the lounge. There was plenty of seating in the…"
4327,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Booked a last minute trip to Tenby and struck lucky as the Park had a cancellation, having not visited the Park since before the Pandemic was a little worried as to what might have changed. Our worries we’re unfounded as usual it was up to its customary high standard, whilst our room and bathroom were on the small side you could not fault the cleanliness also tea and coffee provided. The staff were some of the original people we remembered from previous visits but all were friendly attentive and professional, as usual the breakfasts are to a high standard ( must admit missed the little touch of the welcoming name card ) we also eat in the restaurant on the first night the food is excellent such generous portions and the home made chips are amazing such a nice change from normal…"
4328,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Mmmm ,just spent two nights in this delightful,quality, stylish,but homely hotel,charming rooms,great food,amazing staff,close to all the sights ,but discreetly away a bit ,will definitely go back soon .Thanks to all the wonderful people running this exquisite place,"
4329,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We stayed here for three nights from the 21st April. What a great hotel this is. The outside is well maintained and looks very inviting then you go inside and the wow factor just continues. The hotel inside and out are well maintained and completely spotless. There is a balcony/seating area outside which has amazing views over the beach and the lifeboat stations. A beautiful place to watch the sunrise and sunset. The check in was quick and easy and then off into our room. We had a standard double room(I think) and the bed was large and very comfortable. There was a lovely size tv and tea/coffee facilities,which were replenished daily. The bathroom was also a reasonable size with shower and bath. The breakfast was very tasty and plentiful it filled you up for your day ahead. We…"
4330,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We stayed 4 nights Wednesday to Sunday, we had a standard double room, very clean but way too small, the bathroom door opened out into the bedroom and very close to the bed awful. There was tea and coffee but no drinking water, the hotel is a 3 star the decor reflects this, however the room was so small with just one window that was so drafty we could not sleep as it was so cold, we asked for the heater to be turned up and it was done immediately. The lighting in this small room is awful when you need to get clothes out the wardrobe you cannot see as there is no lighting and I found this very frustrating. The hotel is spotless so clean and fresh. The pool was open but not heated till May so we never used it. The breakfast fruit platter main was worth having, the cooked…"
4331,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Just had 2 nights in the Park Hotel Tenby. Paid £130 per night, only to be given what i can only surmise is ""the box room"" I had barely 2 feet of room on my side of the double bed. The room was dark and gloomy. The small window is half covered with ivy and no window at all in the bathroom. Usual summary, the staff and the communal areas are excellent. Food was also excellent. Dinner and breakfast were of a high standard. We had to curtail our 3 night stay due to a family emergency. So we had to cancel the 3rd nights accommodation. No chance at all of a refund and it was as if the receptionist were given you the refund from her purse. Disappointing customer service. Couple of further issues in the room, the bed runner was full of dust and the toilet seat was well past its…"
4332,The Park Hotel Tenby,Had a lovely stay here. Arrived to a clean room. We’ve had a lovely relaxing Easter weekend. Staff that served us our breakfast every morning worked so hard and were very attentive. They were so friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The only criticism to our stay was that the bed was very uncomfortable. We didn’t report it as we knew we couldn’t move rooms as they were fully booked for the weekend so we knew there was no where we could move to. The mattress was worn on one side ( visibly collapsed) Room No 220 Having said that the sea views made up for our disturbed sleep. Thanks to all at the hotel
4333,The Park Hotel Tenby,"A fantastic stay at this hotel ! Been to Tenby lots of times previously but after staying here I’m not sure I could stay anywhere else ! Hotel views are stunning , everywhere is beautifully clean and well maintained , room really comfortable and with daily housekeeping that keeps the coffee and water topped up . Oh and the breakfast was superb … fresh , tasty and plenty of choice . Good coffee served too which was another added plus ! Which brings me to the service and the hotel team … so welcoming, friendly and nothing was too much trouble . From the fizz we ordered for our arrival through to the late evening pizza we ordered from the bar ( which was delicious!) everyone made us feel like a VIP . Thank you , can’t wait to visit again."
4334,The Park Hotel Tenby,"I booked my husband and I in for a couple of days having previously visited in July last year with friends. The hotel decor is still lovely and the breakfast very tasty and plentiful however this time the room was rather small and quite noisy. We stayed on the 1st floor and the floorboards creaked so loudly above us all night I could hear it through earplugs, it did sound like they would come through, we had someone too who had their TV on full blast and also liked shouting at full volume in the early hours the 2nd night. All in all we only had about 3hrs sleep a night which was a shame as the hotel is lovely but needs structural updating, I don't think we would go back."
4335,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We were familiar with the Park Hotel’s location from having done the coastal walk to Saundersfoot a couple of times in previous years. Set high on a cliff about North Beach but only 10 minutes walk to the church in the centre of town, it was very handy for our purposes. We knew little of the hotel as all you can see is its back facade and car park from the walk, but the Tripadvisor reviews did the trick. This is a very smart hotel set in an exclusive enclave in Tenby, with extensive hidden grounds, outstanding decked areas with singular views of the townscape, a hidden vertiginous private path to the beach, extensive car parking and a sizeable pool for the summer. Our room was a superior side view room and was excellently appointed. The views to town/the beach were sublime…"
4336,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We stayed here for four nights,amazing hotel,unbelievable location. Breakfast and evening meals lovely. Would of been a five but for the barman who listened to his phone on full volume while working,twice we had to move from the bar area as could not have a conversation with this playing,other guests also felt the same,totally unprofessional. Bar and bar meals also amazing value. Very Covid friendly as well."
4337,The Park Hotel Tenby,Excellent breakfast and clean throughout. The hotel is excellent value for money. The premesis are all very well maintained has an discreet and elegant feel. The bar area is relaxing and a tasteful decoration scheme throughout. Ths reception area is smart and there is a pretty landscaping which compliments the stunning longer views
4338,The Park Hotel Tenby,We only rediscovered Tenby after 28 years last summer as previously we went abroad. We had two stays last summer staying in 3 of the higher priced hotels and 3 highly rated BB’s and this hotel beats them all. To be truthful the Park didn’t appeal last year because of their dogs in rooms policy - pre- pandemic but currently dogs are not allowed and I hope this continues or some of the rooms are kept dog free. I spoke with Katie in reception and was delighted to secure a newly renovated Superior side view room for our 3 nights . Since returning I have booked the same room for 4 nights in summer. We liked it that much. It is more expensive but a similar price to the Heywood Spa and Giltar where we stayed last year but so much better. We like it is residents only and the location…
4339,The Park Hotel Tenby,Booked a weekend away and decided on tenby booked park hotel lovely location nice friendly staff restaurant food very nice would definitely come back Placed up high with the most amazing views of the bay and sea
4340,The Park Hotel Tenby,"From the friendly welcome to the easy check out, this was a lovely 3 nights break. Want to give a big shout out to the staff on the breakfasts. So quick and efficient. As soon as you were finished your food they swooped in and took the plates. Breakfast was really tasty with generous portions. Evening meal was also generous. Overall a wonderful stay, will see you again when we are next in Tenby!"
4341,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We stayed here again for the weekend. The rooms have been updated and are lovely but on the small side. Service from reception to fester aunt and bar was excellent. Everyone of the staff were extremely polite and couldn’t do enough for you.Saturday night we decided to book a meal in the hotel and wasn’t disappointed one bit. Everything cooked lovely and well presented. It was actually cheaper to have a drink in the bar by £1.00 a pint than in Tenby itself. The bar man was great, really friendly and chatty. Will definitely be back"
4342,The Park Hotel Tenby,"From the lady on reception to the lady serving breakfast, nothing was too much trouble. What a gem we have found in Tenby. The hotel is spotless. We are South Beach veterans, it's now North Beach for us. A short walk but well worth it. The views are amazing !. Thank you so much and we will be back soon. Ian and Catherine."
4343,The Park Hotel Tenby,"On arrival we were met by a pleasant receptionist, who checked us in, after being given all relevant details and information, we proceeded to our superior room. We were very pleased with a very spacious, spotlessly clean room and fantastic view overlooking the beach and harbour. Only a short walk to town center. Beach can be reached by a pathway from hotel. Dinners/ breakfasts were of the highest quality. All the staff were attentive, nothing was too much trouble. Our 3 nights there have been a total joy and can’t recommend or fault anything about the hotel. Made my special birthday a very memorable one ….thank you All"
4344,The Park Hotel Tenby,"The room had an excellent view of Tenby and was very clean and tidy. Breakfast was lovely, as a lover of the full English I would say this rate up there and the service was exceptionally quick and prompt by very helpful staff. The reception staff were very courteous and helpful and are very happy to help with any issues. One thing that blew my mind were the wireless controlled radiators in the rooms, so at reception can alter their temperatures there on the computer, this I found fascinating as never seen this before. The position of the hotel means it is out of the noisy centre but not too far and was easy access to the north beach via steps just down the road. Parking wasn’t an issue and plenty of space for my car, were I’ve had issue at other hotels where parking was limited.…"
4345,The Park Hotel Tenby,"The views in this hotel are to die for from sunrise to sunset overlooking the North beach. We had good weather during our stay which also helped. Plentiful car parking available on site (a rarity in Tenby!) The staff in this hotel are efficient, helpful and welcoming. All areas of the hotel are impeccably clean, modern and bright. The bar area (Northcliff Lounge) is spacious and bar food and drink prices are not expensive based on hotel prices I have experienced elsewhere in the UK. The board inclusive Breakfast served in the restaurant was excellent. Note that it is served in two sittings (8am to 9 or 9.15 to 10.15) with your preferred time choice made when you check in. The twin room we had was spacious, clean and with modern furniture. Loads of clothes storage space. The…"
4346,The Park Hotel Tenby,"Stayed for 3 nights celebrating my partners 30th birthday. Great location, all the staff were amazing. Facilities lovely and great to have the pool to use. Amazing views over the beach and harbour. Would definitely return!"
4347,The Park Hotel Tenby,"We have had a Wonderful stay. The hotel itself is charming, beautifully decorated and in a perfect setting. The room itself was clean and modern with a gorgeous view of Tenby. The staff were so friendly, especially the barman who was super nice and very good at his job. Breakfast was so well cooked and consistently high quality. I honestly can’t say enough good things about this hotel."
4348,The Park Hotel Tenby,"It would be very hard to find anything to complain about at this hotel. Nice room overlooking the bay, super little lounge/bar with good gin choices, friendly staff and good food. What's not to like. We decided to eat at the hotel on each of the two nights we were there and were not disappointed. The food is not fine dining, more like home cooking, but excellent quality and good choices. We enjoyed our stay very much and would certainly recommend."
4349,The Park Hotel Tenby,"The public areas in the hotel are spacious and comfortable - the staff were friendly and helpful and the meals were very good witha wide selection for both breakfast and dinner - room was on the small size but nicely decorated - however, there are steps everywhere in the hotel, from exiting the lift, down to the dining room into the bar and along corridors - this could be a problem for anyone with mobility issues. Also, it was not clear on arrival that the rooms would not be serviced at all and although it did say on theinformation sheet that towels, toilet tissue, etc. could be obtained from the reception it would have been helpful if the ""self-service"" situation (due to covid) could have been made clearer on arrival."
4350,Biarritz Hotel,"Excellent location, beautiful view of the bay. Short walk through gardens to the beach. Bus stops are right outside the hotel so very convenient. Staff are wonderful and it runs like clock work. Food delicious and plenty of it. The rooms are, quiet, spotlessly clean and the beds are just so comfortable. No bar in the hotel but you are welcome to bring your own wine for dinner and they don’t charge corkage. Lots of places on the promenade to get a drink if you want one. The lounge area is lovely and cosy and should the weather be bad there’s plenty of space to curl up with a book. The sun terrace is gorgeous over looking the bay and a lovely place to watch the sun set. I keep coming back to the delightful hotel and it never disappoints. If you wish to participate there is…"
4351,Biarritz Hotel,"Stayed here with my wife and our friends. A beautiful hotel , very tidy and modern. Breakfast was exceptional and the hotel staff were more than pleasant, always helpful and smiling. A short walk down some steps and your on the beach. Lovely verandas to sit out in the sun and relax if you’re not wanting to move far from the hotel. Would stay here again no bother. I would highly recommend."
4352,Biarritz Hotel,"We enjoyed another lovely holiday at this well run and friendly hotel. We were a couple but I think that single travellers would feel very safe here. The staff work hard and are efficient but friendly. There are a variety of rooms, so when you book ask for what is important to you. The hotel is very clean, quiet and the food is excellent. Best of all is the fabulous view over the bay. The morning prayers are very discreet, so no need to feel awkward if you don’t want to attend. You can bring your own alcohol and it will be served to you at no extra charge. What’s not to like?"
4353,Biarritz Hotel,"Relaxed welcoming friendly atmosphere, staff are pleasant and more than helpful. Breakfast was excellent and all tastes catered This was our second visit to this hotel and will definitely be back. Rooms are spacious. Immaculate and views are breathtaking"
4354,Biarritz Hotel,"My wife and I stayed here in September in a lovely room with sea view and balcony overlooking the bay where we saw beautiful sunsets each evening. The bedrooms are large and well fitted out. There are lots of places to sit and relax in the hotel and outside on the large balcony. There is a wonderfully quiet and friendly atmosphere, with staff who were attentive and nothing was too much trouble. We had b b & evening meal, all of which we found to be of a high and varied standard. We appreciate the Christian ethos of the hotel, this is our 3rd visit and we will come again."
4355,Biarritz Hotel,We booked to stay at the Biarritz Hotel because of the location and good online reviews. The hotel is an easy drive from the ferry port or the airport and we found it easy to park at the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location with spectacular views of the bay and easy access to the beach and promenade. We were given a warm welcome at Reception on our arrival. The comfortable rooms were spotlessly clean and tastefully furnished. There is a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere throughout the hotel. We were very pleased that we had selected to book half board. There was a good choice of excellently prepared food both at breakfast and for the evening meal. The cold buffet served on a Sunday evening is worthy of special mention although all the food served was delicious. The…
4356,Biarritz Hotel,"My wife and I had a lovely room with balcony on the 2nd floor overlooking the bay. The view was stunning, as the hotel is set fairly high up with private steps down to the fantastic beach. The hotel has a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere and all the staff we encountered were very friendly, helpful and attentive. We had booked B&B only so I can't comment on the evening meals but the breakfasts were excellent. This would be the first hotel we would try to book into if we were visiting the island again."
4357,Biarritz Hotel,"Thank you to all the team at the Biarritz for a fabulous stay. A fantastic hotel which transports you back to a time when every hotel guest was a VIP. Great service from all the management and staff - the biggest smiles on the Island. An ideal location (ten minutes from the airport by bus, 5 by taxi) with a bus stop right outside the gate for a terrific bus service which affords access to the whole of the island. The hotel is situated right above the beautiful St Brelade's Beach, with gorgeous views right across the bay. Even if you don't have a sea-view room with balcony there is the sun terrace to laze away the time overlooking the beach. The beach itself is easily accessed by steps down the hill from the terrace. The food is excellent - both breakfast and dinner are…"
4358,Biarritz Hotel,"Lovely location. Excellent hotel with stunning views. Staff very friendly, helpful and felt very well looked after. The food was very good and rooms spotlessly clean and comfortable. This was our 4th time staying at the Biarritz and we would definitely book again. St Brelades Bay has a lovely beach and is very beautiful."
4359,Biarritz Hotel,"I find that this is, in my opinion, one of the best Hotels on the island, The staff are first rate nothing to much trouble to help. accommodation first rate, and food above average. Overall GREAT 5*.."
4360,Biarritz Hotel,This I believe must be one of the best hotels on the island.The service given is un beatable and the staff are all so friendly and helpful. The hotel has its on beach access and a wonderful balcony. We have been coming for many years and the Christian ethos.The of the hotel makes it just special.
4361,Biarritz Hotel,Lovely location and fantastic views from the balcony. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and very helpful and nothing was to much trouble. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone.
4362,Biarritz Hotel,"Lovely suite recently refurbished. Unfortunately the mattress was the hardest we had ever come across. Did not get a good night's sleep. Had to ask for more coat hangers and a couple of glasses. Very poor TV service from You View with a faulty TV (Kept showing a comment ""internet connected "" then immediately "" internet disconnected"") .51 pence per day delivery charge for paper! No bar. Bringing your wine for meals is not the same.No social atmosphere unless you want to join in the prayers. No A/C."
4363,Biarritz Hotel,I have just returned from a week at this beautiful hotel. with breathtaking views of the whole of St. Brelades bay. My room was clean & spacious with lovely soft towels. The wonderful staff went the extra mile to make this holiday extra special for all their guest where nothing was too much trouble. Every morning at breakfast to be greeted by smiling friendly staff and a delicious breakfast! I had booked B&B but took the option of having some evening meals at the hotel which were delicious. On Sunday evening we had a rousing Songs of Praise that was optional but many of the guest joined in and enjoyed. Many guests return every year which in its self is a good recommendation and were extremely friendly especially to a solo traveler. I should like to return next year too!
4364,Biarritz Hotel,"We had a lovely family stay in a seaview room (44) which was perfect with a fabulous uninterrupted view of the whole bay. This is a boutique hotel with a high standard of hospitality and service. As a non-religious person, it was no problem at all and I enjoyed a glass of wine without worry! We stayed a week on B&B - huge breakfast - and when we had dinner, it was very nice. Dinner is inside but they have a wonderful terrace for drinks. 2 mins walk down steps to the beach (maybe 5 mins up!) They were so kind with my 2y old and lots of beach toys for kids to borrow. I only missed a fridge in the room but premium rooms would have this (we booked late on a cancellation as this place is booked years in advance!)"
4365,Biarritz Hotel,We stayed at this hotel for a week on the 20th of August. The hotel is absolutely beautiful very clean comfortable room . We had a room with a big balcony and Seaview. The staff app outstanding couldn’t do enough for you very professional and very friendly they made our stay fantastic. The food was delicious and lots of it. There is no bar as the don’t sell alcohol but that wasn’t a problem you could bring your own you can also check your bottle of wine into the restaurant open it for you get you an ice bucket if you need it. There is plenty of fridges one in the coffee bar and reception that you can put your wine and Other drinks in. The beach is absolutely amazing there’s a private walkway from the hotel down to the beach I have arthritis in my knees I didn’t find it too…
4366,Biarritz Hotel,I felt well and welcome from the first moment to the last! Everything is well in this Hotel to this price! But the very best are the people from the staff. It is not possible to get your coffee in the morning without a smile! The best smile was always one from Rahel from Kenia! But everyone was helpful and friendly!!! I only can say thanks to all!
4367,Biarritz Hotel,"While staying at the Biarritz, my husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary, the staff were amazing they made our evening very special. The staff were always pleasant, and smiling. The food was excellent and lots of choice and catered for every need. The room was clean and comfortable with excellent views of the bay. There was a warm welcoming atmosphere. Good evening activities. The staff were very helpful."
4368,Biarritz Hotel,"We have just spent a week at the Biarritz, our 6th visit there. Yet again it matched, even exceeded our high expectations. Warm welcome, hotel spotlessly clean, tastefully furnished, wide choice of delicious food beautifully cooked and presented. All staff friendly and helpful. We had a Premium Sea View Balcony Room. This hotel would be fully justified in changing its slogan to 3* hotel with 5* service."
4369,Biarritz Hotel,"Our first time at staying at this hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful in answering any questions. Fantastic view of St Brelades Bay from our sea view suite, and also a spacious sun terrace to sit. Food was excellent and a good variation to suit all. Steps down to the beach were pleasant with a little cafe at the end which served fresh lemonade and smoothies. A lovely hotel to stay."
4370,Biarritz Hotel,"What a holiday our first visit to Jersey was. The weather perfect, the company wonderful and the hotel - just the best setting ever! Outside, what views! St Brelades Bay arguably the most beautiful part of the island. Inside, what service! Every member of staff so helpful and friendly (including the Chief Executive!). A very comfortable , relaxing experience. The food was amazing - no need to search the island!"
4371,Biarritz Hotel,"I loved my stay at this hotel, the view is magnificent, the staff is very friendly, and it is close to a very beautiful beach. The inly downside is that you have to climb lots of stairs to get to the hotel back from the beach, which was difficult for me while carrying a baby, also they serve a classic english breaksfash which I’m not really fond of. But again the awesome view makes up for this."
4372,Biarritz Hotel,We had a superb week’s holiday at the Biarritz first week of July. We booked quite late as there was a cancellation and all the rooms with a sea view were fully booked. However this really wasn’t an issue as we had such a spacious room and whenever we wanted to enjoy the superb view we relaxed on the gorgeous sun terrace. The walk down to the beach through the gardens is very pleasant and I can’t recommend the resort highly enough as it is unspoilt and has just the right amount of eating places with great views overlooking the beach. We found all the hotel staff extremely friendly and accommodating. Breakfasts were excellent with pancakes and omelettes available once a week - would be good to increase this! It was a real wrench to leave but we will certainly return.
4373,Biarritz Hotel,From the moment you walk into the Biarritz Hotel you are truly welcomed by all the staff you meet. The Hotel is in an excellent position with easy access to the beach. Additionally the Biarritz is extremely clean not only within the Hotel but also the outside seating areas and the room we stayed in was truly a credit to the staff that cleaned and refreshed the room daily. The dining area was well staffed again in a very welcoming way and the food was totally excellent giving choices to suit the majority of guests. It was also a nice touch for management to take the time to talk to guests at their table about their day which emphasises the caring nature of this Hotel. Travel facilities are very good being just a short 5 minute taxi ride (£11) from the airport as well as being…
4374,Biarritz Hotel,We have just returned from a lovely week's stay at the Biarritz. Our room was clean and had all we required. Breakfast was excellent and the 3 evening meals we had were very good . The staff were all very friendly and attentive The views from the terrace and our balcony were breathtaking. We couldn't fault it.
4375,Biarritz Hotel,Excellent location with wonderful views. Very friendly and helpful staff - nothing was too much trouble. Twin Room was spacious and everything was very clean. Breakfast was plentiful with a lot of choice- my only criticism would be that it would be nice to have some fresh fruit available rather than tinned peaches. There was a fresh fruit salad available.
4376,Biarritz Hotel,"The staff were exceptional, so polite and helpful. Peaceful friendly atmosphere. Food was first class, so fresh and such a varied menu. Great location close to beach with private access and lovely terrace area for sunbathing. Everywhere in the hotel was spotlessly clean."
4377,Biarritz Hotel,Where do you start with this wonderful hotel. All the staff are professional and friendly - nothing is too much trouble. I would suggest half board as the food is all freshly made and fabulous. The rooms are clean and modern. You walk down through the gardens onto St Brelade’s beach. The patio area has brilliant views over the bay and lots of parasols if you prefer a little shade. You can even order light snacks for lunch from their coffee shop should you wish. I’ve been back a number of times in different rooms and they were all of the same standard. There’s even bus stops directly outside the hotel. Just fabulous. Well done Duncan and the team. See you again soon!
4378,Biarritz Hotel,"Visited this hotel for the first time staying for 2 weeks. We booked B&B but asked for dinner on our first night. We were so impressed, we changed to half board for the whole holiday. Needless to say, the food was fab - varied with enough choice. The room - a balcony, Seaview- was spacious and comfortable with amazing views. The staff are tremendous, helpful, efficient and charming. All in all, a wonderful find."
4379,Biarritz Hotel,Duncan & his staff looked after us extremely well. Everyone is very friendly & nothing too much trouble. A lovely family hotel in a great location on one of the best bays. It is very clean & breakfast was always hot & plenty of choice. Thank you Duncan from the 3 ladies with the shower!!
4380,Biarritz Hotel,"Just had a pleasurable weeks stay at the Biarritz Hotel, Jersey. My partner and I had a good sized room with balcony and magnificent views of St.Brelades bay. The whole hotel is decorated in a quietly restrained way, that is very relaxing and calming. Lifts provide access to all levels, so anyone with a mobility issue would be able to enjoy all areas of the hotel. There is a fantastic veranda just off the dining area, again, providing lovely views of the bay and is a perfect place to relax when the sun is shining. The food is first class, although dining times are a little short. What really made the stay extra special were the staff. We can’t praise them highly enough. They were always smiling, helpful and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble for them. So just wanted to say…"
4381,Biarritz Hotel,"We picked the hotel due to it's reviews and location. It did not disappoint us. A wonderful location and a friendly hotel, just big enough to give the service without losing it's cosiness. Sadly we chose to use buses for transport, normally very reliable, but due to a road collapse at St Aubin buses through St Brelades we're in meltdown. Would do the same next time though."
4382,Biarritz Hotel,"WE have not been back to the Biarritz Hotel for four years, so everything has changed and yet nothing has, yes the rooms have been updated and look very nice and they are very comfortable and a good place to sit and rest after a hard day of sightseeing and lovely beds to sleep away the night, All the staff are new from the housecleaning, servicing staff and cooks (No not Duncan) and yet the service is just the same “great” they are all friendly and very helpful, and the food is the best, we were half board so had an evening meal every night, from a menu to Carvery (sort of help yourself) two evenings a week, to cold buffet have what you want on a Sunday. There is also two “lounges” where you can sit and read or just look at the view, outside there are two “sun Lounges” …"
4383,Biarritz Hotel,"I stayed at the Biarritz Hotel with a group of friends to use as a base to explore the WW2 history of the island. The hotel was superb in terms of location, service and food. All the communal areas we’re spotlessly clean and well maintained. Our rooms were singles so a little on the small side but again everything was spotless, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was good. The hotel is run with a Christian ethos and no licensed bar is available but we found it fine to have a few beers away from hotel in other local hostelries. The thing that really struck me was the genuine friendliness of every single member of staff, quite a remarkable thing! Lastly the value for money was excellent and I would thoroughly recommend the Biarritz Hotel. Thank you to the hotel for a…"
4384,Biarritz Hotel,"This was our third visit to the Biarritz Hotel, Jersey, in the beautiful St Brelade’s Bay. We will return no doubt! With sunny and well presented reception rooms you feel immediately ‘On holiday’. The bedroom was very comfortable and what stunning views from our balcony! The staff were, as usual, welcoming and extremely helpful. Duncan, the manager, is thoughtfully attentive to the guests requirements and issues. There is a good choice of delicious and well presented meals each evening. The breakfast bar offers a wide range of choice. From the hotel you can walk down to the beach either towards St Brelades or into Le Ouaisné. It’s worth visiting the parish church and fisherman’s chapel at the far end of the bay, with its ancient wall paintings. You can easily catch buses…"
4385,Biarritz Hotel,"Beautiful location looking over St.Brelades Bay. The staff were lovely, especially in the dining room. Great breakfasts. No alcohol but teetotal so that was fine for me. I didn’t venture down the path to the promenade because of a bad back but it looked lovely down there."
4386,Biarritz Hotel,"We have just returned from a three night stay. We had standard single rooms which were big enough with a shower en-suite. With shampoo and body wash provided as well as hand wash. Tea and coffee making facilities are in the room. There is a guest lift to get up to the rooms. The whole hotel is immaculate the furniture and carpets all look new, everything is in wonderful condition. The hotel has amazing views of St Brelades bay from the lounges, the restaurant and of course the terrace. We were staying on a half board basis. We enjoyed the breakfast buffets. The evening meal on a Saturday is a carvery (there were vegetarian and pasta options), the evening meal on a Sunday was a cold buffet. On other days there is a three course meal with a range of meals to choose from. All of…"
4387,Biarritz Hotel,"Great hotel, fantastic views, lovely terrace to sit and relax, great breakfast, would highly recommend, steps take you straight down to the beach, lovely and flat walk when you get down there, few nice places to eat and drink"
4388,Biarritz Hotel,Our first visit to Jersey with friends. We booked this hotel as our friends who travelled with us have stayed here previously. Slight hiccup on arrival. Upon booking we asked if there was a room with three separate beds and was advised we can have a pull out bed added in the lounge for our daughter. I confirmed this on a separate occasion before arrival room. The main bedroom has a king size bed and a single bed so those plus a pull out were ideal. However when I checked it on arrival Duncan seemed a little confused as to what we wanted and stated he had never been asked for that before and kept referring to the king double as two beds. It’s not two beds but rather sleeps two. I cannot share a bed for personal reasons and His comments made me feel a little embarrassed.…
4389,Biarritz Hotel,"Review on behalf of my parents who visited last month: The working staff excellent helpful, diligent and courteous to a fault. Our room was also good, roomy, and with a wonderful sea view. However there was an accident waiting to happen in the form of the balcony decking which had not been inspected before our visit, or long before that. We informed the front of house manager who shared our concerns. We do hope for the sake of future visitors it will be rectified immediately. As for the manager running the hotel, his cup of human kindness was certainly empty."
4390,Biarritz Hotel,Not long back from a lovely holiday in the Biarritz Hotel. Everything about the hotel was good. Plenty of choice at breakfast and the evening meal has plenty of variety also. Bedroom very clean with some having sea views and balcony. This Hotel certainly deserves a 4 star grading with 5 star service. Will be returning next year if not in September this year. Thanks everyone…
4391,Biarritz Hotel,"The hotel was quiet with guests of a similar age to us (retired). The food was excellent, served by a wonderful, attentive and efficient staff, recruited from Africa. The state of decoration and cleanliness of the hotel were immaculate and all the fittings in the room and ensuite worked faultlessly. Off road parking was always available for our hire car. The hotel is not licenced, but we bought supermarket wine at supermarket prices, obligingly kept in the hotel fridges for us and produced for our dinners. Not even a corkage fee!"
4392,Biarritz Hotel,"Had a wonderful week at the Biarritz. Very friendly, efficient staff. We had a fantastic view from the balcony of our spacious, immaculately clean room. Breakfast and dinner were very enjoyable every day. Excellent location with superb views over bay and easy access to public transport. Plenty of sight-seeing and places of interest - Jersey Zoo is a MUST."
4393,Biarritz Hotel,Just home after a week stay in the Biarritz Hotel. It was my first visit to Jersey. I travelled with two friends and stayed in room 138 that had a fantastic view from our balcony over the Bay. The hotel staff were accommodating and very friendly. We had half board and thought the food was outstanding 10/10 for the Chief. The hotel was clean and provided all that was needed.
4394,Biarritz Hotel,"I have just returned from a six night stay at the Biarritz Hotel. This was by some distance the cheapest hotel I found on the island, but it was better than a number of more expensive hotels I have stayed at in Jersey. I had a single room at the side of the hotel next to the footpath to the headland between St Brelades Bay and Ouaisne Bay. Despite being in the shadow of the woods the sun shone into the room in the morning through the trees. A bonus was the bath which it is unusual to find in a single room. Breakfast was buffet style and there was no limit to how much you had, there were plenty of staff on hand to serve tea and coffee, and to help those who required assistance. The restaurant and terraces offer panoramic views across St Brelades Bay. I am very pleased that I…"
4395,Biarritz Hotel,"This is a superb hotel with amazing views. The views are beautiful in the extreme. Very clean facilities and a lovely friendly atmosphere. The staff are all superb, charming and very very helpful. Rooms are serviced to a high standard daily. There is a great range of food for breakfast and evening meals. All enjoyable. Beds are comfy and all necessary facilities provided."
4396,Biarritz Hotel,The hotel boasts spectacular views of the bay; steps to bay quite steep The rooms were spacious; but a little dated No license for alcohol; although no objection to taking your own Structured meal times; reminded me of my time nursing in a home! Meals served at allotted times and conveyor style and you were asked to choose what you want to eat in the evening at breakfast-!! (Providing you had evening meal at the hotel) a choice of 3 meals to chose from one being vegetarian. The manager was visibly present throughout meal times ensuring everything is to your liking; not what I call I would consider a relaxing evening meal ! When I booked the hotel I didn’t realise it was a Christian hotel ; I have no issues with religions; but I was surprised to see the vicar at breakfast meal…
4397,Biarritz Hotel,"This is a very good hotel with well-trained staff, and is in a superb position with outstanding views over the bay. Our room was really comfortable with a beautiful sea view. The food was good and breakfast had an excellent choice. The hotel is very efficiently managed but in a friendly way. The lack of a bar was not a problem, as you are allowed to bring your own wine or beer with suitable glasses provided free. We very much hope to return."
4398,Biarritz Hotel,"We booked this quite late and I had emailed the hotel for a higher room if possible, this was only in case I needed to work, we got what we had requested, it wouldn't have been a deal breaker anyway. The room was fairly large and storage was good. Bathroom was nice too. It got a little warm in the night for me (my age) but I discovered a big fan in the wardrobe and stood it on the stool so cooled the room down nicely. The food was lovely and we had a few meals during our stay, the breakfast was very nice and I had a sausage on mine that I put on accidently as I dont normally eat them, I dont know where they are from but I would buy them for sure, high praise from someone who doesn't eat them as a rule. The views in this place are amazing and its a lovely stroll to the beach down…"
4399,Biarritz Hotel,"We had a week at the Biarritz Hotel. The room was large with a comfy bed, a sea view and bathroom which looked as if it had been recently refurbished. We booked half board. Both the breakfast and evening meals were good and staff very helpful."
4400,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"A warm welcoming and friendly place , the food was lovely the service was great the rooms Devine and some lovely walks nearby , in all a gem of a find ,will gladly return .the spa is so relaxing and treatments was just that a real treat , both of us had a wonderful welcoming"
4401,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Amazing experience as always. We got married here in December and this place holds a special place in our hearts. I can’t fault anything! The food is incredible. The staff are friendly, helpful and will always go out of there way to help you"
4402,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,The service was great and the food amazing we will definitely return. They even brought us a cake at the end of the night to congratulate us on our 10 year wedding anniversary. The hotel rooms were modern and clean.
4403,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,Our Wedding was just magical! Believe it but this venue and the team behind this make dreams come true! Paige went above and beyond from the moment I met her to make sure everything was just perfect and it was! From calls when the odd supplier meet went wrong to her finding the most perfect solution in minutes! These are the experts and this was the best decision we made to get married here! I could honestly praise the venue and all staff from reception to the Wedding managers Tanya and Anne who looked after us so well on the day! These guys made everything look seamless! I could honestly write a book with how happy we were! I now have a friend for life with Paige she is honestly one of the kindest people I have ever met! If you want a team to put their heart and soul into your…
4404,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We Had a Day in The Spa, Followed By a Meal @ Wilfreds Then a Luxury Stay in a Suite. From Start to Finish We Had The Best Day! We've Dined at Crow Wood a Few Times But Never Stayed or Visited The Spa. It's a Little Pricy But You Get What You Pay For. Can't Fault a Thing. The Staff, Friendly. The Food, Amazing. The Room, OMG! The Spa, Like Being Abroad, Especially if You Get The Weather! Cocktails, Very Moreish. You Literally Could Be Anywhere. Safe to Say We Will Be Back!"
4405,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Stayed at the hotel just for one night and then one day at the Spa. All of our experience was excellent, only one thing that spoilt our stay was the 3 rooms we booked were not ready for us but that was rectified and we had a complimentary bottle of wine. But overall a brilliant experience"
4406,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Enjoyed every minute, Spa very good and relaxing , hotel excellent rooms very comfortable and food was lovely would definitely go again, also had the mud experience which was fab, cocktails were also great"
4407,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"From the minute we walked through the door we was made to feel special. We booked a package for our annivesary and everything Bertrams, Woodland spa, hotel & Wilfreds was perfect. The spa facilities are outstanding, the food is delicous and the serice is outstanding. Every staff member was polite & the standard of their work shows. Crow wood is a credit to everyone who works there. Thank you for making our day so memorable."

Love the new Mr and Mrs Clarke"
4411,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We go here regularly for a treat and it is wonderful. We have stayed at the hotel also which is amazing. It is worth a visit and is a treasured couples treat for us. The food, the service, the standards all fantastic. But could use more offers on as it is expensive"
4412,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,The staff were extremely friendly. The food was exceptional. The accommodation was first class. We will definitely be visiting again. The location is most convenient for visiting the interesting countryside.

Suite £ 433, Spa £ 180, Lunch & Cocktails £ 170 Dinner £ 144 ( Booked as upgrade to DBB & supplements paid also inc bottle of wine ) As with most things in life you get what you pay for and if you want to indulge yourself in luxuriousness, I couldn’t recommend this place highly enough"
4420,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"excellent room and hotel in general, I've stayed here before hence the reason for my return we loved it. food was amazing along with the staff and the spa was to die for, so much so that on my 1st visit i proposed to my now wife and on this visit returned for my 1 year anniversary.

4422,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Fantastic hotel with top class facilities, great food and drink offerings and best of all superb helpful and friendly staff all round. This hotel is highly recommended and well worth a visit. Best hotel we’ve stopped at for years"
4423,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Visited for the first time after hearing great reviews. What can I say… Amazing food both in the spa and hotel, fabulous hotel - clean and modern, friendly staff and the spa was out of this world. 4 out of 5 of us had treatments and they were very relaxing, just what we needed. This is no.1 on our spa list. We will return"
4424,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"absolutely fantastic,place is excellent staff are excellent,went to a wedding best iver ever been too,run seemlessley by the hotel id do it again tmrw,food beer entertainment,the room was massive in good condition,the staff were first rate"
4425,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,We visited as a group of 6 for a 50th. Fantastic time had by all of us. Not a single complaint about anything. The staff were brilliant - the food was divine. Rooms are lovely and the hotel and grounds are gorgeous. The hotel left a birthday card for the birthday girl and at both lunch and dinner did a birthday plate. The former was without any prompting. Everyone in the group would love to return soon. Thank you Crowood!
4426,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,Great Service. Easy check in & out. Sandra was very helpful. Lovely clean room. Decent breakfast. Enjoyed the bar area. Didn't use the spa facilities this time but will be back at some point to try those out
4427,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,A little disappointed as it was very noisy dusting the early hours of the morning by other residents on the corridors shouting and also moving beds at 3am. Told reception about this the next morning but they didn’t seem to be bothered. For an expensive hotel I wouldn’t have expected that.
4428,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,went for a mamma mia dinner show which was good fun . the two course meal was excellent as always . we stayed over as i had a voucher which made it very good value and enjoyed swimming and an excellent breakfast the next day. staff as always very polite and friendly
4429,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Breakfast bit disappointing. Coffee from machine,and all self service. Would have liked some personal service,and fresh coffee to b brought to table. Nor much atmosphere,in the bar area. Staff were very good and professional. Drinks above average in price."
4430,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Excellent service from Rudolph, reception, bar and Wilfred’s restaurant (Roxanne) . Would Definitely revisit. The only negative was the entertainment Mama Mia tribute on the night and DJ could be heard from our hotel room till late but room cleanliness and cleaning staff was the best."
4431,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,Yet again another amazing stay. The hotel is fab and the reception staff are very welcoming and helpful. We did the Mama Mia evening and everything was faultless from the food and the entertainment. Will definately be back...
4432,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We've stayed many times at the Crow Wood and the standards and quality have never been below 5 star. The staff, food and facilities are great. First time using the Woodland Spa and it definitely won't be the last. Keep up the good work"
4433,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We attended ny nieces wedding here the other day,i can't comment on the day,service or meal,just the evening reception. We arrived around 7pm,meeting up with family who had been there most of the day. We sat in the bar area,while we waited for the reception room to be made ready,typical hotel bar prices,as usual dick terpin must have been there!!.£6.70 for a shandy... Eventually the room was ready,i have to admit, this was really nicely decorated for the occasion. We arranged ourselves/family table,sweet trolley(yep first into that) photo shop,adding to the album. Not sure if this was a resident dj,but god he could have turned it down a notch,couldn't speak to anyone,too loud. I went into the other bar to get myself a drink,as this area was a little bit quieter,but was told…"
4434,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"A beautiful setting and an amazing hotel. The staff were friendly, accommodating and professional. The breakfast was spot on and the room was spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed. The toiletries were of a good quality."
4435,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We got married at Crow Wood on 31/03/23. From first seeing the venue 18 months ago and meeting Paige we knew this was the venue for us, it ticked all our boxes being modern, with amazing views and garden area, beautiful bridal suite, it was everything we wanted and more. The wedding exceeded all our expectations, the food was lovely, the service was amazing, we had a lot of support and both Paige and the rest of the team regularly checked in with us to make sure everything was perfect. The day was beautiful from the ceremony to the lakeside suite, the crow wood team as well as the venue dressers did an amazing job, it was exactly how we pictured it. I can’t put into words how thankful we are to crow wood for making all our dreams come true and for the most amazing day, so many…"
4436,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,Amazing break just what I needed. The hotel was great the food was delicious and the spa was the best Iv ever been to. Would recommend the mud paste treatment was great on my skin. The whole thermal journey was amazing.
4437,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We booked a spa experience stay, and it was amazing. Such a lovely hotel in beautiful surroundings. The thermal spa experience was very good. I have been to many spas and this was defiantly one of the best I have used. All the pools and steam/sauna rooms were amazing. Our room and meals were 5star. Loved the whole Experience and would defiantly recommend it."
4438,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We booked into this fabulous Hotel for our 10th anniversary treat and for my birthday celebration. We weren't disappointed. On arrival (02.05.2023) we were met at the door by the Concierge, ""Stephen"", who on seeing me arriving using crutches, following recent knee surgery, offered to collect our bags / cases from our car and take them upto our room. He was polite, pleasant and obviously very helpful. We were then escorted to check-in, where a swift and simple chec-in was processed. The Receptionist was also very pleasant, polite and very informative, giving us all the information we required to navigate the hotel, restaurants and the Spa. We were advised of some building works being carried out outside the Spa entrance and that it may create some noise during our stay. As a…"
4439,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,Lovely setting and extensive woodland/ Manicured lawns. The hotel and spa Facilities are great. The Gym is also well furnished with new equipment. 3 Restaurants provide lovely food at sensible prices. Staff at the hotel are excellent
4440,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Fantastic spa facilities , love the outside facilities. The sun loungers, and the hot tubs. The bar has a good choice of cocktails and tapas. All the staff nice and friendly. The food is excellent wherever you eat at Crow wood. Had a facial, it was lovely treat for myself and it was worth every penny."
4441,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Really lovely hotel. Clean, well furnished and really friendly staff. Wonderful wedding venue complete with picturesque views. Perfect location for an exclusive wedding. Food also fantastic and well presented"
4442,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,Gorgeous hotel. Lovely friendly staff. The most nicest food you will ever eat. The rooms are great they even have plug sockets in the right places by the mirror and by the desk. Iron and ironing board. Kettle and complimentary bottles of water.
4443,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We had an excellent experience for my daughters wedding over the weekend. Everything from the staff in all areas from the moment you walk up to the front door was fabulous, you can tell that the staff enjoy working at the hotel, the food was amazing. Several members of the wedding party thought the spa was the best and you can even go for a run around the grounds if you prefer. Would highly recommend for a wedding or even a break away or indulging in the spa ❤️"
4444,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Came here 29th April for my brothers wedding on the 30th. Upon walking in, we were greeted with a warm welcome off the two guys on the door(sorry didn’t get their names) but they are lovely. Checking in was a breeze and all the staff were lovely, informative and helpful. We had a twin room first night as all doubles had gone ( another wedding that night ) but I have to say the beds were huge and very comfortable. Room was very clean and spacious. We had just a shower, which was very roomy. Changed rooms next night to a double, which was the same, just over bath shower. Had dinner in the restaurant on the Saturday night, had Truffle chicken, absolutely lovely, really enjoyed it. If there was a downside, the only thing I would say is the drinks are a little expensive, £4 for…"
4445,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Be aware that:- 1. This is not a spa hotel. It has no pool or any spa facilities. The Woodland Spa on the wider site is completely separate and has to be booked and paid for direct with that business. As does Bertrand's restaurant - where we are on both nights and it was nice. 2. Treatments at the Woodland Spa are largely allocated to spa day packages and local clients who book treatments only. Hence there was no availability for Friday, Saturday or Sunday two months before our visit. 3 . The 'luxury' rooms in the hotel are more budget end basic e g. no drawers for clothes, a thin duvet that was too small for the bed (didn't reach the edges of the mattress), small bath towels and 3 teabags with UHT milk. 4. Unless you're able to find a staff member to order one of the…"
4446,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"Wedding!!!! We were guests at a family wedding here this weekend and wow what can I say!!! It was incredible from beginning to end, the things is there’s so many 5 star resorts but honestly this place has it all, plenty of staff who are extremely attentive and service is impeccable, rooms are beautiful and food is outstanding. Do not hesitate to book this place for your wedding or even just a stay. The best hotel we have ever stayed at and we travel a lot! Thank you to all the staff for making our stay the BEST!!!!!!"
4447,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"The total experience at the Hotel and Spa was of the highest order, firstly the staff are welcoming, friendly and efficient in all areas. The facilities are superb within the Spa area, in both inside and external areas. We were fortunate enough to have an overnight stay in the onsite hotel, a wonderful experience first class rooms, high class food and a wonderful atmosphere, I have stayed in many hotels and this is up there with the best."
4448,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"from arriving at the hotel to leaving my husband and I were made to feel special. From being chauffeur driven in a buggy to our car and room at the farm house to the amazing professionalism of the staff on reception, the restaurant and the bar too. The breakfast was amazing too. Would highly recommend and will be definitely back."
4449,Crow Wood Hotel & Spa Resort,"We had a lovely stay at the hotel. We booked when there was a special offer to dine, stay over and a bottle of Prosecco. We had a pleasant evening. It would be good if guests staying over are offered a reduced Spa rate, we might have booked had we have been offered this. The hotel rooms don’t have fridges or minibars which I would expect in an upmarket hotel."
4450,Loch Shiel Hotel,"My wife and i had many meals here during the fortnight. The staff are very friendly and cheerful. We managed to sample most of the food menu, lovely lovely food, with fantastic service. Also a great pint of the local i p a . Will definitely be back."
4451,Loch Shiel Hotel,Stayed for one night at the end of May 2022 and received a very warm welcome on check-in. All staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Room was very comfortable and everything worked as it should. Restaurant served delicious food in the evening and breakfast (included) was great too. Lovely peaceful place to stay whilst exploring the beautiful Ardnamurchan peninsula.
4452,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We visited twice this holiday based on previous experience. We had a group of ten both times and the waitress who has been there a while (at least the past two/three years) as on hand to look after us. She always does her best to make sure everyone is looked after regardless of how busy she is. Great, honest food and great, friendly and honest service. Our second visit was our last night on holiday and our niece's 12th birthday and the lovely waitress was brilliant."
4453,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Such a happy hotel bar with cheerful, welcoming staff. The bar is a nice place to have an early drink. There is a dining room and a sort of annex where we sat. It was a nice view over the garden and the loch but the dining room looked a bit more atmospheric. Simple food but lovely and plentiful and a reasonable price too. There is no pretension here, just good, honest food and a great atmosphere."
4454,Loch Shiel Hotel,Stayed at this hotel in August with our rescue dog. Absolutely beautiful scenery and nice room. Good was a bit expensive but really nice. Breakfast was good. The staff were very accommodating with our dog and my worries about Covid. It was amazing weather for Scotland and we made full use of the beer garden.
4455,Loch Shiel Hotel,"This evening my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed an evening meal in the Loch Shiel Hotel. The service was cheerful, helpful, welcoming and efficient. The food (Haddock and Chips) was served speedily and was piping hot, freshly cooked to order and tasted absolutely delicious. The sticky toffee pudding was one of the best I've tasted in a very long time. Thank you all at the Loch Shiel Hotel for making our visit both enjoyable and memorable. Many congratulations and very best wishes."
4456,Loch Shiel Hotel,We stayed at the Loch Shiel Hotel for one night during a motoring tour of Scotland with friends. We had a very warm welcome on arrival and enjoyed a superb dinner. I had a steak and kidney pudding which was one of the best I've ever tasted in my whole life. We had to continue our tour the following day but I hope we will be able to visit again ad enjoy more of the superb food and excellent service we received in September 2021.
4457,Loch Shiel Hotel,"we had a very bad meal here the menu stated pan sheared scallops starter £9 when it came it was 1 scallop on top of a slice of haggis, the rest of the food was of poor quality and when the bill came they tried to over charge us by £ 20 and considering the there was only 2 of us that was a considerable error. so don't eat there"
4458,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We are at the hotel twice during our stay in Acharacle. The staff were very communicative during booking and in trying to amend our reservation. Serving finishes early and we were not able to be accommodated after 5.30 despite there being only one other table occupied besides us. The service was efficient, bordering on rushed. The mussels and langoustines were excellent. Steaks average. We would have stayed longer (and spent more money) if we had felt genuinely welcomed. It felt like they wanted to get as many people through as possible, despite it not being busy (especially on our second visit)."
4459,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Dined in the bar area four nights of our holiday, we were staying 10 minutes away by car. The staff were welcoming and friendly, the chef here is excellent, the food really well cooked and tasty, we were spoilt for choice. The Cullen skink was the best we’ve had. The place is spotlessly clean and all Covid measures are in place. A lovely relaxed atmosphere with great views out over the Loch We really recommend calling in for a meal, though pre booking is essential at the moment. A particular mention to the waitress who lives close to the hotel, she was particularly lovely and really looked after us. We even chatted about the history of the area which I found fascinating. Apologies that I didn’t ask your name. Thank you to all the staff, we will be back next summer."
4460,Loch Shiel Hotel,We didn’t stay in the hotel but we did enjoy a meal. We were made to feel very welcome. ( dog friendly too ) The food was delicious and the atmosphere cosy. The outside space is large with terrific views of the hills. Seems to be quite popular and would be advised to book.
4461,Loch Shiel Hotel,"This hotel was built in 1901 originally as a shooting lodge , it has a lot of character , there is no lift but that wasn't a problem. The room I had was clean and tidy , the bed was very comfortable , I had 2 good nights sleep . The food was very good , the breakfast was excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful . The bar had a good selection on offer , it normally plays host to local bands but due to Covid this has been suspended. A few minutes away is a local shop which opens at 9am."
4462,Loch Shiel Hotel,We popped in on Friday night. Unfortunately we didn't have a booking and due to the current restrictions its not always possible to get in anywhere. The staff in here are excellent. They went out of there way and managed safely to make space for us. The food was excellent and the staff were very helpful and made time to tell us where to find the best local beaches. The great service and local knowledge made it a special night for us. Thank you Billy & Laura June 2022
4463,Loch Shiel Hotel,I enjoyed staying at this hotel. It has that 'old highland hotel' feel. I like the unique individual atmosphere compared to the big chain hotels. The staff were very friendly and the service was good. The evening meal was excellent and al the social distancing measures were handled very well. I had a room with a view of the loch. The bed was very comfortable. There is no lift (understandably) so if you are on the top floor there are some stairs to climb. I would highly recommend this hotel.
4464,Loch Shiel Hotel,Great welcome for 2 tired and thirsty cyclists. We had a lovely large room overlooking the front garden and the Loch. Very comfortable beds . Very nice food. Secure bike storage. Friendly and helpful staff. Great position with a real away from it all feel. Recommended!
4465,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We rocked up here at about 5pm, after being let down with the accommodation that we had booked. Although they were short staffed and hadn't had the opportunity to finish cleaning all the rooms that weren't booked, they welcomed us in, finished cleaning a room and booked us in for dinner. The room was delightful, situated at the top of the building, overlooking the loch. Very spacious and we were very glad to be there, in fact thinking that we were better off there than where we had originally booked. Dinner was very nice and they couldn't do enough for you. Pleasant after dinner drinks followed by a good night's sleep in a comfortable bed, and personally cooked breakfast, has set us up for our drive over to Skye. Thank you so much for taking pity on us and saving the day."
4466,Loch Shiel Hotel,Spent a night here while working up north. Great hotel lovely staff and food was top class haggis fritters to start with an amazing pepper sauce followed but venison stew special 10 out of 10. Worth a stop by even if just for a meal
4467,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Initial impressions were encouraging, however the facilities were basic and the rooms had seen better days. This is usually tolerable but the Covid adherence officious particularly compared to other hotels. The food was reasonable pub quality; no more. The dining experience very disappointing; chaperoned into a sterile characterless room. There was a distinct lack of friendliness. Overall disappointing experience."
4468,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Driving past and stopped in for some dinner. Great food and well presented, menu offered a good variety and fresh produce. The staff were welcoming and attentive, good value for money. Would recommend"
4469,Loch Shiel Hotel,"My family and I ate here last week and I can honestly say that the food was stunning. I have eaten in some of the top hotels and the food hasn’t come close to what we had here. Would highly recommend anyone to dine here. Menu is a little pricey but totally worth every penny. Service and welcome was great to. Just the right amount of time between each course. Highly recommended......,"
4470,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Barely adequate food priced as if fine dining. Example a starter of 3 small scallops 2 pieces of chorizo and a cherry tomato halfed for £8.95. Cheapest main £12.50 for a mushroom and sweet potato tart, the sweet potato consisting of 2 sticks of roasted potatoes taken from the accompanying roasted veg. Another of our party had the pork belly, £19.50 for a flabby piece of pork and 2 undercooked scallops. Feels like this hotel has devised a menu to maximise profit but doesn't have the skill or generosity to deliver a satisfactory customer experience. Only bonus was the polite young service staff. We would have been really happy to pay the above prices had the food been better. Ardnamurchan really desperately needs more food choices."
4471,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Firstly it’s worth mentioning the staff and the typical bar punter who were all very polite and welcoming. Sadly the food was extremely poor with the burger more like a microwave burger and the macaroni resembling that of cheesy pasta from a box. The fish... no crispy batter, Just a whiteish soggy batter! The bar area looks very tired and could be doing with a refurbishment. A mixture of bright lights and pine cladding. A very friendly location which was nice."
4472,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Stopped at the Loch Shiel hotel for a meal after being sent there by the Salen Hotel and restaurant. It was a great recommendation, the service was very good, and the food hit the spot. Prices were perhaps slightly higher than average, but I have no problem with that in a remote setting. I'd certainly go back."
4473,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Hotel staff were welcoming and friendly. Our room was clean and adequately furnished for a short stay, albeit that the bed was somewhat small. We enjoyed a good breakfast, but the evening menu was pretty much bar food - tasty but unexceptional. However, the eating areas were always busy and the bar filled with a lively crowd of visitors and locals. The Loch Shiel, like too many Scottish tourist establishments, benefits from limited bed capacity in the locality and so during the busy season room rates reflect demand more than quality. It is, nevertheless, a good base from which to experience the exceptional beauty of Ardnamurchan and Moidart."
4474,Loch Shiel Hotel,Another great meal at loch Shiel hotel. Excellent efficient and warm service with good grub and kid friendly menu which is essential in a family hotel. Good steak and crispy pizza went down well. Thank you.
4475,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We ate twice here whilst staying in Kentra Bay and both times were not disappointed. First time we booked and really enjoyed our meal of lightly battered Haddock and chips and sticky toffee pudding to follow - yummy. Second time on the spur of the moment but the staff accommodated us no problem even though the hotel itself was very busy. Battered scampi - freshly cooked and caught, by its taste; chicken breast with pepper sauce and fresh vegetables, puddings to follow - again an excellent meal. Lovey staff, lovely food, lovely location, would hope to return if and when we are in this area again."
4476,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We stopped here for a night. The building itself is a lovely old shooting lodge but the public areas are in need of a complete refurbishment. However the staff are welcoming and generally helpful. We stayed in a small unit at the back of the hotel which had been refurbished and was what we expected, clean and functional. The food was fine but particularly at breakfast the kitchen seemed to be understaffed which makes it hard for a chef to do their best."
4477,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Did not stay overnight as self catering in the area, had evening meal only. Pre booked a table. Good menu choice and daily specials available. Good table service. Food delivered quickly after ordering. Big portions. Had scallops for starter - cooked well. For main had venison burger served with chips and salad. Big portion and could not finish as full. Wife had Cullen skink for starter and Cumberland sausage with mash. Again big portions cooked well. Noticed that restaurant also did takeaways of fish and chips. Good place for a meal."
4478,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We called into this remote Hotel for lunch whilst driving in the area, we had two pizza’s which were freshly made in house, very tasty. Service was excellent, and good value. The only comment whilst the place is out in the wilderness with fantastic views from the dinning area, the grounds could be a little more inviting and cleaned up. But well worth a visit if in the area."
4479,Loch Shiel Hotel,"This establishment is off the beaten track but so worth a visit if you’re touring Scotland. We enjoyed a lovely quiet stay and took advantage of eating an evening meal there in addition to our breakfast. Both were substantial and offered many gluten free options. Rooms are spacious and toiletries are provided. Within a few minutes walk, there is an old pier which leads to the loch. Thoroughly recommended."
4480,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Good Location Great views Brilliant evening meal Good cooked breakfast Great serving staff We have used alot of B&B recently in Scotland As a hotel it is a poor B&B when it comes to breakfast Poor No decaff tea (available in all other places we stayed) Mint tea only one bag Fresh fruit (well orange apple and turned banana for you to peel/prepare) look at the competition they all serve fresh fruit assortment and this was Outer Hebrides. Jam choice for toast strawberry, strawberry and strawberry."
4481,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Myself ,my wife and two grown up children decided to have a weeks holiday together in the Highlands and chose a property in the village of Acharacle in Lochaber. We arrived a couple of hours before we could get into the house so we stopped off at the Loch Shiel Hotel for drinks. We had a really warm welcome and felt immediately at ease. After looking at the menu we decided to book a table for the evening. We were not disappointed. The restaurant offers a great selection of local seafood and produce and also caters well for vegetarians. The food was well cooked and was fresh and tasty. We booked on two more occasions across the week and we would thoroughly recommend a visit to this hotel if you you are in the area."
4482,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We stayed here for one night but we would have happily stayed longer! The Lochsheil hotel was one of the most chilled and relaxed places we have ever stayed in, surrounded by beautiful scenery. It is an old hunting lodge and has charm and character. The decor and fittings might not be the most up to date but this doesn't detract from the cosy and friendly bar, frequented by locals. We ate in the dining room, I had haddock and chips and the batter was melt in your mouth delicious. Staff were helpful without being OTT and the Kipper my husband had for breakfast was the best he'd ever tasted. Would certainly stay again."
4483,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We popped in for lunch one Saturday as the café over the road was not open and we had been walking all morning- we met with a warm welcome and sat down to some lunch. I had the fish and chips which were great and OH had the sausages with mash, again was good. Good beer on tap too, so not disappointed at all, the view from the dining room os lovely down the loch too."
4484,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Called into the Loch Shiel hotel last weekend when it was very busy, but the staff were charming and fitted 7 people in for dinner without a reservation. Food was excellent, and the atmosphere and staff very welcoming - don't miss out on the brilliant fish and chips ( and the monkfish scampi was pretty tasty too)"
4485,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We visited Loch Shiel and stayed for one night eating in the restaurant for dinner and breakfast during our stay. It’s a funny place, it definitely seems popular with the locals as the bar was bustling when we walked in. We were checked in quickly by a friendly lady, and went up to the room. The hotel as a whole needs a bit of refurbishment, I understand it’s a hunting lodge and you want to keep character but it does look like it needs TLC. The room was a good size and nice and clean. The bed was comfortable although the radiator in the bathroom was in full and couldn’t be turned off so we slept with the window open, which then lead to us being disturbed by raccous people leaving the pub late. The dinner was okay, to be honest I think I made the wrong choice going for the…"
4486,Loch Shiel Hotel,Stayed there for one night got there late still sorted out some good food friendly locals good selection of drinks this is not a premier inn its a hotel with character Would stay there again no problem
4487,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Spent a lovely evening at the hotel. Sam was fabulous and extremely helpful. Dinner included a starter of haggas nachos....seriously you need to try this at least once in your life! Miss Lynda prepared our breakfast the next morning, it was like meeting and old friend. A great experience all round."
4488,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Not a place you chance upon unless you are aiming to explore the Ardnamurchan peninsula but it is a very welcoming Hotel with comfortable rooms and excellent food and drinks. We arrived earlier than planned in a storm and were disappointed to find the place completely deserted. However, on checking our booking, we discovered it did say ""from 4 pm"" so we explored the area a bit more and got soaked...but it was beautiful. Sure enough....at 4 pm the manager arrived and thereafter our stay was excellent. Dogs were very welcome, despite being drenched, and the food was superb, particularly breakfast. The chef was extremely entertaining and friendly as well."
4489,Loch Shiel Hotel,"The Loch Shiel Hotel is a Victorian lodge which is clean, bright and comfortable. It includes a modern bar, good food and exceptional staff and if you are a lover of scenic beauty, peace and quiet and countryside second to none, then staying in the Loch Shiel Hotel will provide just that. Also the hotel allowed us to bring our well behaved Border terrier. This stunning area, good food, warm and friendly staff made our stay so enjoyable and we will look forward to returning next year."
4490,Loch Shiel Hotel,Very relaxing atmosphere in this place. The service is very good and very quick. Lovely selection on the menu. There can be busy times in the bar area where the locals are very friendly. Great selection of whisky.
4491,Loch Shiel Hotel,"We were not served for dinner at 8:30. Tables were available. Not even a soup at the bar. Reason, kitchen is too busy! What a poor statement! Just remember. The Harry Potter hype will end and tourists that fill your purse will no longer stray to this dump."
4492,Loch Shiel Hotel,"A fantastic hotel in a stunning location. A little remote if you expect everything on your doorstep, but if you like peaceful, relaxing locations with unspoilt views, friendly and accommodating staff and a relaxed atmosphere, it's perfect. Wonderful breakfast and dinner menues and spotlessly clean and comfortable rooms. Very highly recommended."
4493,Loch Shiel Hotel,"having just driven the entire UK coast line in a month, I can say hand on heart this hotel was by far the best one, the rooms were big, the showers was amazing, the staff were just second to none (well done the lot of you) the food was good and just what I needed after a day behind the wheel. Wifi was weak in the bedrooms but then thick walls do tend to thin out signals. Then even went the extra mile and did my laundry saving me time and effort the next day finding a laundry in Tobermory. I would stay again without a seconds thought."
4494,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Pleasant enough place in a remote location , and to be truthful not many other options nearby but the food could be improved. We just came in on the off chance and there was plenty of space ( only one other couple eating) both of us had fish and chips and it was mediocre at best and not particularly cheap, however I suppose costs are higher in these remote areas Staff were very friendly"
4495,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Friendly staff, pleasant surroundings, good beer choice, extensive menu, quality food, good value for money, good blend of locals and visitors, all positive. Would advise to book a table for dinner because it did get busy."
4496,Loch Shiel Hotel,This location was a beautiful stopping point overlooking the Loch. The manager was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and very comfortable. The food was amazing!! The best food that we ate during our week long drive through beautiful Scotland. The road to and from the Hotel was an experience as it was primarily a 1 lane road. We booked 3 rooms and the views from 2 of the rooms was amazing!
4497,Loch Shiel Hotel,"I can highly recommend this hotel, situated in a lovely position at the bottom end of Loch Shiel. It may not look impressive from the outside but inside you are assured of the best of Scottish hospitality. The staff are excellent, in particular the manager, Lynda, who went out of her way to make available an impromptu drying room for wet walking gear. The room was recently renovated, clean and comfortable. The restaurant didn’t have a Michelin star but was more than adequate. In short, a little gem."
4498,Loch Shiel Hotel,"Popped in for lunch whilst passing by and we were both really impressed by the food and the service; I had the langoustines and soup and my husband had smoked fish and fish and chips. They were some of the freshest and tastiest and best priced I’ve had - and we’ve been coming to Scotland for over 25 years and make a point of seeking out fish restaurants to eat in. The waitress (and I can’t remember her name) was fantastic; genuine, friendly, helpful. We felt very welcome and she was giving us directions to lovely beaches andpaces to see. It was such a lovely experience that next time were up, we will make a bee line for this hotel. It’s very worth the 2 hour drive for."
4499,Loch Shiel Hotel,Stayed one night and used as a base to explore the area and this hotel was perfect. It has plenty of Highland charm and VERY WELCOMING STAFF. We had a room with a view of the loch on the 2nd floor and it was perfect for our needs. We had a great sleep in a very comfy bed with lovely bedding. You cant beat a small local hotel with an open fire and friendly conversation with locals in the bar.
4500,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"The BEST place to land after an overnight flight! Big bed, the best linens, blackout curtains, soaking tub. It was the perfect antidote! The restaurant was a little confusing (also we were confused with jet lag) but within 2 blocks there are tons of ethnic/vegan/yummy takeaway shops, and a great coffee shop at the corner. Easy walk to the Castle, and the hop-on-hop-off tours."
4501,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"As usual we had a great stay at our preferred hotel when in Edinburgh Our family and friends use the hotel quite a lot and I did not want post this review on Tripadvisor as few niggles annoyed us. We love this hotel and agree with the whole ethos of the business We stayed on 6th and 7th April 2 rooms 314 & 307 and on the first morning we couldn't get breakfast, arrived at 9.20 and felt so sorry for staff on duty that day was informed that 100 people arrived at once no were to sit lounge was being used as well , had a quick look at the food it was wiped out so we ate out. 2nd day much better but no pastries? Dinner in lounge that evening once again staff lovely food limited and no kids menu and drink shockingly expensive We notified staff on check out and apologies was given.…"
4502,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"I took a long time researching hotels in Edinburgh before deciding on Ten Hill Place. I was not disappointed. This hotel is wonderful; the rooms are spotlessly clean, the bed very comfortable, large bathroom- I loved my cozy room. The staff are all very nice and helpful, everyone I encountered was amazing. The location is terrific, about a 15-20 min walk to the Royal Mile. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. Breakfast was good, the usual buffet offerings. The price was great, especially in Edinburgh where everything is quite pricey. As is typical in Europe, there are no washcloths for us Americans-I brought old ones from home and tossed them after a few uses. My only dislike was the shampoo they offered; it was more water than shampoo. I used the body wash…"
4503,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights here. It's a modern, stylish, independent hotel in a great location. All the city centre attractions are within a 10-15 minute walk including the castle, Royal Mile, Prince's St and Holyrood Palace. Also, numerous bars and restaurants. You can even walk to the top of Arthur's Seat in less than 1 hour. Our room was lovely, a good size with a large bathroom and very comfy bed. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night. There was a good variety on the menu and the food was well cooked, presented and tasty. Breakfast was standard buffet but with some welcome Scottish elements including haggis. All the staff were friendly, helpful and gave a great service"
4504,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Hotel is a managed property. Not a hotel. It is clean but it’s very loud! Also there was trouble when checking out. They do not give you face cloths or any toiletries, you have to ask for them. They try to say it’s for the environment but it is a cost savings to this property and completely ridiculous. It’s a very budget hotel. Staff is super nice."
4505,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Excellent hotel!! Room was spacious & spotlessly clean. Little touches were greatly appreciated such as bed made & our nightwear neatly folded. Tea & coffee replenished daily. Staff were all helpful & pleasant. Hotel located a 10 min walk from main restaurants/Bars
4506,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Spacious room, large bathroom, spotlessly clean, excellent view, friendly informative chatty staff, 10 min walk to Royal mile, tasty breakfast, dinner menu, maybe slightly more choice, highly recommend"
4507,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Went here on Easter Friday arrived early but reception staff were fantastic. They took our bags and put them in the room for us whilst we went out in Edinburgh. The rooms were spacious, clean and the bed was so comfy. It’s a 10 min walk from Waverley Station so it’s a perfect location, As it’s situated in the surgeons quarter it’s was really quiet ( stayed in room 208) which looked right into the square ( no traffic) so was lovely and had the best sleep considering it’s a busy city. I will definitely go back to this hotel the staff were so accommodating and the breakfast was superb, it’s buffet style, but it was fresh and has excellent choice, including haggis, continental as well as lovely croissants etc. they made fresh poached eggs as requested with no additional charge and…"
4508,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Straightforward and quick check-in/out. Went to make a tea as soon as we entered the room and the teaspoon was dirty (dry tea stain). In the room is a feedback card to indicate is something’s wrong with the room (you fill in and drop off to front desk) but the room didn’t contain a pen to write on it. Asked front desk for info on travelling to the airport and was given wrong price for the bus.
4509,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Lovely hotel. Very clean and comfortable room. Excellent service from all staff. Within easy walking distance of the Royal Mile and Princess Street. Highly recommend. Have stayed 3 times now and have never had any issues.
4510,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Excellent choice of a hotel when in Edinburgh. Beautiful room, plenty of space, and a lovely big, comfortable bed. A good location not far from the Royal Mile, National Museum etc and Princes St (east end) an easy walk down from the hotel, about 10 minutes. Plenty of places to eat around the hotel if you’re not dining in. A minor quibble would be that the restaurant menu is a bit “ safe”. Nice enough offerings but nothing too adventurous. On the other hand, breakfast was excellent with locally sourced haggis, sausages etc. We arrived on public transport so I can’t comment on car parking. A lovely stay."
4511,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the stay. It’s a little bit away from the centre but an easy walk to the Royal Mile. The rooms are very comfortable and well equipped. They have a nice bar where you can get the superb 1505 Surgeons Quarter G+T and a very good restaurant that serves a great breakfast We will definitely return
4512,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Loved this hotel. Nice, spacious and clean room (safe, hairdryer, fridge, kettle) with a modern bathroom. Excellent sevice at the reception. Loved the beautiful horse themed art around the hotel. The location is nice, 10-15 min walk to the old town/Royal Mile. A number or supermarkets and restaurants around. As the New Town is an additional 10-15 min walk, tram isn't really a convenient option e.g. for airport. As for breakfast, we tried it one morning, but luckily hadn't payed for it for total of our stay as it was quite a mess. A buffet with average options, quite okay, but coffee and eggs to be ordered from the staff. The orders were lost and mixed up and took more time than they should. But otherwise brilliant hotel."
4513,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Can’t fault this hotel, arrived 2 hours before check in time and our room was already ready, also informed at the desk we had be given a free upgrade to a deluxe room. Upon getting in the room we noticed we had an issue with our air-con system which was very promptly fixed. The hotel was in a really great location within walking distance of majority of tourist attractions and plenty of nice dining places near by. Would definitely return to this hotel in the future."
4514,Ten Hill Place Hotel,An excellent location and super comfy room - Excellent staff - with lovely beds and super nice shower. You can walk to all the tourist sites within 10 minutes its that good Only one downfall the fridge could have been a lot cooler
4515,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"We used value voucher and had the best couple of nights in a great hotel. The room was very spacious and comfortable with kettle, tea, coffee,biscuits and some unexpected chocolates. The large bathroom had a bath as well as an over bath shower. We were provided with bathrobes and slippers. Our deal included breakfast both mornings and £70 towards an evening meal. The buffet breakfast was very decent with traditional Scottish fare. Eggs could be ordered freshly fried/poached, very nice. There was some continental fare and fruit as well as fresh bread, croissants and pastries. We had a lovely evening meal our second night. Beautiful food in a very comfortable dining room and prices very reasonable. I would eat there even if I wasn’t a resident. Staff were very pleasant and…"
4516,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Stayed in two rooms in the hotel between Christmas and New Year. Ate breakfast each day (good, though perhaps could do with more choice) and dinner once (also good). Good choice of gins and cocktails at the bar, though modern lounge area can seem a little stark and unwelcoming. Friendly and helpful reception. Very well located, in quiet area (no night time noise). Used multi-storey car park about 10 mins away; not the nicest/easiest access but safe. Would stay again."
4517,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Had a lovely stay, accommodation was first class,staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful,Although the restaurant was quiet when we visited the food was of a very high standard. It is well situated for all of the attractions. Would stay here again."
4518,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Excellent location: handy for the city centre and simply perfect for the Festival Theatre which is literally around the corner. Numerous shops, bars and restaurants within walking distance. A short walk to the railway station and about 15 minutes from the Airlink bus and the tram to the airport. Professional, kind and courteous staff. Spacious, modern, well appointed and very clean rooms, with a large and well lit bathroom. Nice breakfast!"
4519,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"We’ve just returned from a Sunday night stay. The hotel has had good offers over the winter. We previously stayed just three weeks ago. Last night we were treated to a complementary upgrade, which was a much appreciated surprise. The hotel is consistently very clean, extremely comfortable and well maintained. The staff are very pleasant, the receptionist who checked us in yesterday afternoon particularly stood out. We’ve not eaten there apart from breakfast, but always enjoy a drink in the stylish bar. 10 Hill Place is now our main “go to” for weekends in Edinburgh, and we look forward to returning soon."
4520,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Lovely clean modern hotel in a great location. The room was clean and a good size with a nice bathroom -(would have been nice to have had some hand soaps to use to wash your hands) I did ask but we didn’t get any so I brought some. Nice powerful hot shower which is always a bonus. Breakfast was good, a nice selection and a good price of pre booked it’s cheaper. Friendly happy staff and a great hotel, would definitely recommend and stay here again"
4521,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Stayed for one night in February. We had the most fantastic, huge room with floor to ceiling windows where we had views towards Arthur's Seat and over the rooftops to the Firth of Forth. The bedding is immaculate, top quality and the bed so comfortable. Slept well. Great bathroom and powerful shower over bath too. We were bed, breakfast and evening meal. Breakfast was excellent. Continental and cooked. Great choice and the cooked part was hot and tasty. Evening meal too was excellent. Food was delicious and service friendly and with a smile. First class, immaculately clean hotel with friendly staff. We would stay again next time we visit Edinburgh."
4522,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"This is a first class hotel and the fourth time we have stayed here. Immaculately clean, ideally situated to walk into city centre and reasonably priced. Staff are exceptionally helpful and food delicious - sorry we missed you George 😃 . We will return and wouldn’t go past 10 Hill Place when booking a trip. We drive from the borders to Straiton Park and Ride and get the bus to Nicolson Square which is a 1 minute walk to the hotel front door. Love this hotel testimony to the number of times we have stayed."
4523,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"We stayed three nights and have nothing bad to say about the place. The staff were all pleasant and helpful, the food was decent although we only had the breakfast buffet, and the rooms were great. The rooms were cleaned daily and all the used towels were changed, not that they need to change them. It’s a well situated hotel in easy reach of the attractions and the Royal Mile. I would definitely stay there again."
4524,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Stayed 2 nights and from the moment we arrived we felt at home. What a lovely,ethical hotel this is! Staff are just so friendly and helpful - even helped sneak banners and balloons into our room as it was hubby's birthday. Stayed in a superior room which was spacious and well designed. The public areas are lovely too. The attention to detail is amazing....the different size menus line up to depict a horse's head and the subtle decor is just lovely. There is a lovely well equipped gym too. Ate in the restaurant on one night.... delicious! Breakfast,buffet style, the best we have had....I even had choice of 2 vegetarian sausages without having to put in a special order!! I honestly can't fault anything about this hotel. Looking forward to sowing the flower seeds which are given…"
4525,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Fabulous stay. Staff were lovely and friendly. Hotel was exceptional clean.Breakfast lovely but alas no kippers this morning. Definitely will stay here again and recommend it to friends . Only walking distance to princes street and most facilities.
4526,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Wonderful stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, rooms cleaned perfectly and with attention to detail. walking distance to most of the things we wanted to do. The on-site restaurant is also quite good and reasonably priced."
4527,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel in a great central location within easy walking distance from the Royal Mile and Edinburgh Old Town. Hotel is modern, comfortable and spotlessly clean. My room was tastefully furnished - looked like new - and I had a fantastic walk-in shower and comfortable bed. This was my fourth stay and I'll definitely be coming back again!"
4528,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"What can I say! Me and my husband try to visit Tenhill twice a year and we are never disappointed. Food is great, staff are friendly and welcoming. We initially booked for 3 nights but during our stay changed to 5 nights . Heading home to book time off so I can book our return thank you again"
4529,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Just got home from a two night stay, a very nice hotel which was spotlessly clean, great decor throughout and the staff were welcoming and helpful however the food in the restaurant was a big let down. Firstly we were told half of the starters on the menu weren't available due to supply issues, we decided not to have a starter as we didn't fancy what was on offer, we both had fish and chips as our main, it's is £24 so I thought it would be nice, unfortunately I was wrong, the tartar sauce was lovely but the chips were frozen which you can buy from any supermarket and the fish was greasy. The breakfast wasn't much better, the bacon, beans and sausages had run out and took a while to be replenished, the black pudding was rock hard and the scrambled eggs looked sloppy. It's a…"
4530,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Recently returned from a 2 night stay after enjoying our last trip. Reception excellent, décor and room super, clean and warm. The biggest disappointment was the restaurant. We were not advised on arrival that there was a function on that evening so we should book a table. We appeared and the dining room was practically empty but were advised we could get a table in approx. 20-30 minutes as they were busy preparing food for the function. We didn’t bother, plenty of local eateries. The best was yet to come. Breakfast, a good variety to chose from as long as you don’t expect it to be hot. On both mornings the eggs and mushrooms on offer from the serving area were empty/cold requiring you to hang around for 10/15 minutes while the dishes were refilled. There was a good selection of…"
4531,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Lovely room as usual,very spacious and nicely furnished. Large bathroom. Staff were very friendly and explained everything well at check in We ate in restaurant and found it very overpriced and breakfast was not great. Selection of baked goods was poor and continental plates not replenished . It was ok for what we paid but on asking the cost of room for end of June for friends was quoted early £400 ! No way would that be value for money so sadly will be looking elsewhere in June."
4532,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"The hotel is situated not far from the Royal Mile, excellent location, near everything but in a quiet street. We booked room only but we took breakfast each morning, at £15 each it was good value. The hotel is very modern and although the room we had was small it was immaculate and had everything you needed and to be honest if you are in Edinburgh you spend little time in your room. The bed was really comfortable, one of the best we have experienced in any hotel. We didn't eat in the restaurant, the menu was not to our liking but there was plenty of guests who did. The hotel is only about 15mins walk to the tram which takes you to the airport so no need for taxis. The outstanding feature of this hotel is the friendliness of the staff, we arrived at 11am were just going to leave…"
4533,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Stayed for two nights for Christmas experience. Arrived early so left bags and returned at around 5pm. Checked into the room and noted the bed was not king size. Unfortunately the receptionist argued about this and was insistent this WAS indeed a UK king size bed. I have a UK double at home and it was exactly the same size. We were told that the hotel was full and we could not be moved but when we continued to push the point they were able to find a room with a king- but told us this was a “super king” Also had to argue about the complementary chocolates that should have been provided. We were told they were only for people booking directly through hotel- however this isn’t the case at all and when they were delivered to the room the receptionist just started telling us about…
4534,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Just stayed for 3 nights. We booked a half board package with EasyJet. We arrived at 9am after an early flight so checked in and dropped our bags. The lovely receptionist was very helpful and gave us a map so we could start exploring. We arrived back at the hotel about 5pm and our room 201 was ready and our bags waiting for us. Room was large and nicely decorated. Bathroom was large too but showing signs of mildew around the bath, this needs addressing sooner rather than later. The air conditioning kept the room warm but was so noisy, it did however black out any other noise and we all slept really well for our 3 nights. Breakfast was a simple buffet, again all the staff were welcoming. I would have liked to have seen a better/fresher quality bread but it was fine. We were on a…"
4535,Ten Hill Place Hotel,Stayed in room 532 for 2 nights. Paid £270. Unfortunately our train was cancelled on the day we checked out. So being stuck in Edinburgh we asked if we could stay another night (luggage still in their storage room). The girl on reception put us back in the same room we had left earlier in the day. I asked for an improved rate as she was asking for £209. I informed her of us staying the last 2 nights and the room rate we had paid for the previous 2 nights. The reply I got was I’m sorry I can’t do anything about that! I expressed my disappointment but the only interest was getting the best room rate! I feel like I have been ripped off with no loyalty or help to the situation shown what so ever. On any return trip to Edinburgh which was lovely I will never stay at that hotel…
4536,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Airport taxis costs £28-£29 each way. Really lovely presented rooms and public areas in a good location. Be prepared to argue for the room upgrade you’ve paid for though. We’d upgraded to superior with king sized bed but but were allocated a double bed. I was told this was a “standard UK king”. I was only moved when I became insistent, and although I’d been told they were full, a room suddenly became available. If this is actually their idea of bed sizing two people wouldn’t fit in a double! Also, the 8 handmade chocolates listed as supplied with the superior rooms were missing. This resulted in a phone call followed by an argument in reception before they appeared. Very disappointing having to stand in reception and go onto their website for the room list and also bring…"
4537,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"On arrival the place looked lovely and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. We were able to check in early too. Room looked nice with a large bathroom. However, went to bed on the first night and were unable to sleep. The bed was rock hard and uncomfortable and there was a green light on the ceiling that couldn’t be turned off and we were bathed in a bright green glow all night long. Breakfast wasn’t particularly great either. It’s a real shame because on first appearance, it’s lovely and it’s very conveniently placed within walking distance of shops and local attractions."
4538,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Lovely 3 day stay with partner . Hotel was best high standard and very modern inside and out. Hotel situated with loads of restaurants, cafes and well known food chains near. Lots of supermarket express near which was handy . Room was big and spacious . Modern bathroom . Situated around 20 minute walk to princess street . Lots of amenities and attractions near. Looking forward to visiting again !"
4539,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"We've just come back from a 3-night stay. We stayed in a skyline suite which was beautiful. Prosecco and chocolates were in the room waiting, which was a lovely touch. They also brought our bags up to the room for us. All the staff were very helpful and answered any questions we had. Room service was quick and food was good. The only negative was the breakfast. The food was cold and wasn't the best quality. I didn't eat much at all and left hungry. I had read reviews before staying and knew some people had said the same. We thought we'd paid extra to try it on our first morning but were left disappointed. We decided to find other places during our stay. Really good location for everything. We will definitely come back again 🎄🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿"
4540,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay at this hotel. The staff are very helpful and all ways happy to help. The buffet Scottish breakfast is a must try freshly cooked. Definitely will come back in the near future, close to the Royal Mile, Xmas Markets etc"
4541,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Great hotel, well located and within walking distance of the Royal Mile and associated attractions. We arrived at around 1.30pm expecting to drop off our bags and check in later but our room was ready so after a friendly and seamless checkin we went up to our double deluxe room that we’d booked for 3 nights. It was a clean well equipped room that was perfect for our stay. Breakfast each morning was excellent, a warm welcome from the Staff, followed by a great choice of food and endless tea and coffee. A great start to each day, wouldn’t hesitate to use this hotel again."
4542,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"This hotel is amazing. Arrived at 11.30 and asked to leave bags as check in was 3pm, was greeted by friendly staff told room ready and given keys. Offered any forgotten toiletries as these not supplied in room as standard. Which it does state on website. Also given £20 voucher to spend on food and drink in the hotel as booked direct. 4th floor room but window didn’t open at all, luckily air on was good. Room was clean and stylish with white soft bedding. Shower was amazing, large, powerful and plenty of hot water. Towels were huge and soft. Slept well, did have concerns as our room was opposite the lift, but didn’t hear anyone else. Black out curtains also helped. Breakfast was hot and fresh, with unlimited tea/coffee. Would definitely return to this hotel"
4543,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"We arrived on the 29th November for two nights to celebrate my wife’s birthday On arrival we were upgraded to the roof line room which was a really nice gesture Reception staff very friendly and helpful during our stay We ate at the hotel on our first night recommend the 10oz ribeye steak cooked to perfection Again staff very welcoming in the bar and restaurant area Sleep was great on both nights Breakfast was lovely and hot, again staff very helpful and friendly. We booked direct with the hotel and we’re given £10 voucher each to spend on food or drink in hotel. Thank you Ten hill place for a lovely stay room 403"
4544,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Lovely hotel, welcoming and friendly staff, very clean and comfortable rooms, excellent location away from Princes Street but walkable distance to most attractions - will definitely stay again. This will become our go-to hotel when visiting Edinburgh."
4545,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Me and my Partner stayed here for 3 nights in Late November 2022. We were impressed with the hotel, the staff and the overall experience. We really enjoyed the small touches of wild seeds to plant when home. The hotel has an amazing eco ethos that encourages guests to be mindful of carbon footprints. The room was comfortable, spacious and well decorated. We visited the Surgeons Museum that is part of the hotel an interesting museum and well worth the visit. The hotel is in the heart of the Old Town with Edinburgh castle and St Giles cathedral about a 10–15-minute walk away. We highly recommend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying here again the next time we visit. Thanks to all the staff at Ten Hill Place for making us feel so welcome."
4546,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"This hotel was in the perfect location. We were able to walk to all the tours we signed up for. The room was clean and you have the option for a “green” clean if you want to reduce the environmental impact of your stay. The only complaint I had was there were two of us but they kept leaving only a single bath towel. Easily and quickly rectified with a call to the front desk but it surprised me that two towels weren’t automatic for two guests. The warm goat cheese salad with gnocchi and sweet potato was hands down one of the best dinners I’ve ever eaten, anywhere. I highly recommend staying here, as it was a quiet location but close to everything."
4547,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"The room was rather spacious and quiet. Good consistent A/C temperature and comfortable bed. Friendly and helpful staff. Good amenities provided in the room as expected from a 4-star hotel but additional toiletries (e.g. lotion) had to be requested from receptionist at lobby. The central location makes it ideal for tourists when visiting most city centre attractions. However, the cleanliness of the room could still be improved. There was a lot of dust accumulated above the door frame in the toilet and under the bedside table (but still visible from standing height). The roof window could do with a bit of cleaning."
4548,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"Great 3 night break at this lovely hotel. From the start the staff were so friendly and helped with all of our questions. Delicious breakfast each day - so much choice. Lovely classic double room - comfy bed, 2 pillows each, super bathroom with toiletries if you would like them (you're asked at reception when you check in). Plenty of hot water at all times. We asked at Reception how to get to the Royal Yacht Britannia at Ocean Terminal, Leith and were advised to get the 35 bus from Chambers Street which took us straight there for £1.80 each! Only a few minutes walk from the hotel up to the Royal Mile so great location too in the Old Town.Would highly recommend this hotel"
4549,Ten Hill Place Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights over Halloween weekend. We had a classic double room which was small but perfect for our short break away. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The hotel is in a quiet location. We enjoyed that the hotel was walking distance to all of the central sites but in a quiet part of the city for sleeping. For booking directly on the website, we were given 3 x £10 vouchers which we could use in the café or in the hotel restaurant/bar. We had nice cocktails in the hotel bar. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. Overall, it was a great stay!"
4550,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Stayed here with my husband for our anniversary. Had a really lovely stay. What makes this hotel great is the staff…. From housekeeping, restaurant staff, reception ladies, up to managers, are brilliant. Nothing is ever too much to ask for and everything is done with smiles on their faces, plus they always have the time for a little chat. Shout out to Kayleigh and Victor who really made us feel welcome. Lovely views, a quite lunch in the Champagne Lounge and dinner in Elizabeth’s. Everything was just fabulous. A lovely week away, thank you."
4551,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Everything in jersey costs . That is just a reality. For this hotel the only standout for me is the breakfast. It would be a very harsh critic or someone with very exacting needs to find any fault with the breakfast service or variation or quality. I would book again just bcs of the breakfast.
4552,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Recently stayed a few nights here excellent service special thanks to Luke Eastaff for making our stay very welcome nothing was to much trouble always polite and pleasant . Hotel was always clean food was brilliant and our room was lovely with a fantastic sea view.
4553,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Just home from a wonderful stay at this Hotel .. it really was five star ⭐️ throughout our stay .. Room was amazing plus we had a balcony to sit out in the sunshine .. that was a nice surprise.. room had everything you needed .. Hotel facilities .. pool/spa was again fantastic .. Breakfast buffet had everything .. had dinner twice in the hotel .. both times food was perfect .. would also like to say that the service from everyone was first class ... 4th time in jersey but first time staying here .. won't hesitate to book again ... Beautiful Hotel
4554,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"This island is a perfect place to enjoy and relax.....plenty to see and do....only downsize very expensive at moment...mainly because of cost of living crisis.....but ...the grand hotel is fantastic Staff,food,amenities, all first class...."
4555,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Went for our wedding anniversary and was looked after. The breakfast was good and enjoyed the food in the champagne bar, we didn't try the restuarant as it wa booked with conferences. What made it a bit special was on our anniversary day the housekeepers made 2 love swans out of towels and placed them on the bed. The bed was comfy and the whole place was spotless. The only bit I couldn't understand was why did they put blurred pictures on the walls in the corridors"
4556,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Beautiful room, very spacious and couldn’t fault the quality of facilities or service. All staff super helpful and polite. We used the spa facilities too and loved the luxury. My only niggle is that you have to walk through smokers at the entrance - and that smokers are allowed on the terrace - really off putting when eating ."
4557,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"I have enjoyed staying at the Jersey Grand on several occasions and I was really looking forward to the pleasure again. I had booked two nights 9-11 May but, unfortunately, my flight was cancelled due to foggy conditions over Jersey. I telephoned the Jersey Grand, to explain that I had been forced to cancel through no fault of mine and to ask not for a refund but to ask for a rearrangement for a stay at any later date. I received a curt reply that their policy was no refund and no rearrangement. I hope to be compensated by my travel insurance and I will not be staying again at the Jersey Grand."
4558,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,We enjoyed the best few days staying at this hotel. We were returning to stay here again after 6years. We found it to be even better than we can remember. We were given complimentary upgrades which gave us sea views from refurbished rooms. The rooms were most comfortable. The staff are first class as is the food. Location is very central for walking and public transport to all amenities.
4559,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"We spent 4 nights at the hotel last month with 3 other couples. It was fabulous, the staff were all extremely friendly & helpful. The beds were very comfortable, as were the pillows. The spa was great for relaxing in after a day out. I have to say though, the piece de resistance was the breakfasts. We have stayed in many hotels, but never had such a fresh buffet breakfast and a choice of specially prepared options. They also facilitated an early continental breakfast for us on our last morning as we had an early flight home. We also ate in the cocktail bar & that was great too."
4560,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Perfect location 5 minutes walk from the bus station where you can catch a bus to anywhere on the island, we bought a 3 day ticket. lovely friendly hotel, the staff couldn’t be more polite our stay here will be well remembered and hold to return, when we get chance"
4561,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"St Helier as a whole is a little ‘dated’, however the Grand stands out as a hotel that the owners have put time and money into keeping as a true 5 star experience. We had a very nice, modern room (deluxe Park view - recommended) with all the facilities we could want. The staff all go the extra mile and are clearly very well trained as well as being friendly and welcoming. The breakfast is superb, and it’s a nice touch that this will be delivered to your room at your choice of time with no additional charges (unlike other hotels who like to load up a “tray charge” on your bill). We didn’t have dinner in the hotel but the restaurants looked like they were top quality. My only reservation is that spa and gym is quite limited - if we had come here hoping for a “spa weekend” I…"
4562,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"A short swim and use of the facilities, then Spa treatments with Elemis (amazing) followed by a lovely glass of champagne and tea in the lounge. Bliss!! Highly recommend alone or as a couple especially if it is a lovely day with a view of Elizabeth Castle!"
4563,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Nice hotel, nice sea view room, spacious, well equipped. Breakfast good, catered ok for gluten free although oat milk is not suitable for coeliacs so odd to see it on a gluten free section. Free parking which is rare these days. Only downsides, lack of channels on TV and even with the air con on 17.5 and the windows open the room was stupidly hot."
4564,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Wonderful stay hotel was really nice try and get a sea view room well worth it ,room was spacious and clean and had everything you need breakfast was amazing and so much choice all the staff were really pleasant and helpful the hotel itself was spotless the only downside was a lack of parking but there is a lot of paid parking close by"
4565,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Lovely hotel with superb staff. We had booked a superior sea view room, but got upgraded to a suite! Fantastic room facilities - comfy bed, lovely bathroom, fab “living room” area and superb view of the castle. Concierge, reception and waiting staff all friendly, polite, efficient and professional. Breakfast excellent - a choice of table service or comprehensive buffet selection. Super-efficient maitre d’ too. Spa facilities and treatments fantastic - we didn’t have time to use the pool, but looked really inviting. All in all an excellent stay in a great hotel!"
4566,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Just back from 4 nights here with my partner, her son and my mother. A mixed bag if you will. (The group that us, not my mother) We were in a suite with stunning views of the sea from both the bay window in the living area and from another window in the dressing area looking right down the promenade. My mum had a view of the hotel roof and a lock up garage. The food in the hotel was excellent, breakfast was buffet style but you could also order food from the menu. Plenty vegetarian and vegan options. Location wise it was a 5 minute walk from the shops and restaurants and was also right across the road from the beach. Would certainly go back. All staff were super helpful and very informative regarding Jersey and things to do."
4567,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Having last stayed in October with my old Labrador, we enjoyed our time and wanted to come back. We made direct arrangements with the hotel to secure the same room as previously, a very well appointed corner suite, by the main staircase, with small balcony and lovely views straight out to st aubins bay and Elizabeth castle. It was a lovely 3 days with attentive service and great quality food, 2 nights we dined in the champagne lounge where Poppy Labrador was welcome to join us and a 3rd night some indulgence in Tassili fine dining, which was 7 courses a beautiful fine Jersey inspired dishes. The weather held overall for us so we visited Gory harbour for lunch and also St Aubins Harbour for late morning coffee with an afternoon in St Helier, with a look at the fish market. …"
4568,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Lovely hotel with lots of old world charm. Staff were efficient and pleasant. The ocean view room was spotless with complimentary water and a pint of milk. We had most of our evening meals in the champagne bar but there were other alternatives. Breakfast was buffet style with certain choices available directly from the kitchen. It was the first time I've ever seen poached eggs on a breakfast bar as an alternative to fried..well done! The only downside was the poor parking places.There were a few places underground but a tight fit and about half a dozen near the entrance.
4569,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,We stayed at the Grand Jersey for a sporting event and had a fantastic experience. From the time we arrived to the time we left all the staff were friendly and professional offering excellent service. Thank you Grand Jersey for hosting us and for putting up with us. Nick
4570,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"I'm prompted to write this after seeing the negative review. I have stayed here four times so far this year, and a couple of times last year, for work and have always had a very positive experience. The staff have always been friendly and helpful. Breakfast is excellent. Nice gym, excellent pool, sauna and spa. I've previously stayed at a number of other hotels in Jersey but this is now my first choice."
4571,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Felt thoroughly looked after by the hotel staff, they couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast and afternoon tea delicious. Wine expensive but seemed to be the same across the island. Only downside was the spa. Double price of treatment elsewhere but staff fairly surly and not particularly great compared to treatments I've had in the past. I wouldn't bother next gime. Only 2 chairs by the pool so don't plan a long time in the spa."
4572,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Spent 3 days here in mid March for a long weekend. Staff wonderful, facilities great and food fantastic. Room was very comfortable with everything needed. I particularly liked the non-standard corporate feel to this hotel which you often get in larger chain hotels. Really enjoyed staying here and will do so again."
4573,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,We booked this hotel on Hotels.com without a cancellation and were due to arrive today 1/4/23. Unfortunately our father passed away and we were unable to go. The hotel refunded the price of our rooms when they had no obligation to do so. We intend to come next April god willing. Thanks for everything.
4574,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Right outside the hotel is the ferry boat that goes over to Elizabeth castle which is very nice to visit. But actually the ferry is really a bus because it will drive when the tide is out and the sea is not high.
4575,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Just back from a 4 night stay at the Grand Hotel. I got a very good deal through Booking.com. The room was quite compact, but had all amenities including fridge, ironing board, toiletries, well equipped tea making facilities, etc. I'd probably upgrade to a Seaview room next time. Housekeeping did a very good job of keeping the room clean and replenished. Breakfast buffet was very good, large selection of breakfast items, all well cooked, plus you could order items cooked from the breakfast menu. Fresh breads, juices, smoothies, cereals, pastries etc. I ate my body weight in Full English breakfast over the 4 days...all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Special mention for Patrick the manager who resolved a minor problem very quickly, and got us into the afternoon cream…"
4576,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"We’ve just got home today from Jersey and yes some things didn’t go to plan at first, just mentioning one, we had a room which the heating wasn’t working properly so a wonderful gentleman Paul came up to take a look and wasn’t able to sort it so he took me down to reception to find us another room which due to the hotel being booked up we weren’t able to get a room for the whole 3 nights so we were upgraded for 1 night to a room with a balcony which was lovely then for the 2nd and 3rd night we were upgraded again to a suite room number 200 which was absolutely amazing, we’ve stopped in many suites before but this was the best ever. We’d planned to eat at different places over our stay however the food, cocktails and great service we cancelled the booking and with the upgrade we…"
4577,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"We recently stayed for three nights at this delightful hotel. The location is excellent, with views from our room over the sea and Elizabeth Castle. The ferry to the castle leaves from right opposite the hotel and it is well worth a visit. Staff at the Grand were fabulous. Everyone we met was very friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good and the dinner we had in the restaurant was amazing. (Try the filet steak!) We made several visits to the champagne lounge for drinks and coffee. Quality and service was always first class. We will definitely be returning to this excellent hotel and can't wait! Thank you all for a wonderful stay."
4578,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,5 star service - we recently stayed at the Grand hotel for my husbands 40th birthday. The Staff and service was amazing and could not fault a single thing. Tasili was just out of this world and the waiting staff amazing !! Thank You for making our stay so special.
4579,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Absolutely fantastic hotel, one of the best I have ever stayed in. Faultless! Make sure you stay here, the breakfast was just perfect. Room was very good c/w air conditioner, spacious bathroom & unlimited tea / coffee. I have stayed in many hotels on the island but this beats them all!"
4580,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Fantastic room in terms of the view of the sea and garden. Facilities in the room were great like the fresh milk, heated towel rail with fluffy white towels. Concierge were very knowledgable with buses/sightseeing etc. Breakfast was high quality and loved the ‘help yourself’ style to it. Easy to get around the island because the bus stop was right across the street to go yo St Auben’s/St Brelade’s Bay and also to the airport. The only down side to this hotel was the slight patriarchal undertone to the service we received. I visited with my boyfriend. The booking was under my family name. Despite that, every time we were together some staff spoke to my boyfriend rather than myself. The worst of this was at breakfast when the member of staff said “What’s your room number sir?” I…"
4581,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"The hotel is going through some renovations which are needed. Reception staff - excellent and welcoming. Concierge - Alvis wasn’t genuine but the other colleague was - he allowed us to wait in the champagne lounge. (Although they reacted quickly), the chef in the breakfast area, clearly was not used to dealing with people who looked like us: at one point he responded to me via the grill when I asked a question! I had to deal with 3 days of his responses which left me feeling cold, especially when seeing his interactions with others - this is why I have such a poor review - he literally spoilt my holiday! It was remedied on the last day. We don’t believe we will visit this hotel again, although we will return to Jersey."
4582,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Loved this hotel Had a very warm welcome and could even go into our room earlier than the check in time as we arrived very early We had a lovely room with comfortable beds. The room had all amenities we needed such as tea/coffee , nice hot shower , hairdryer, safe The Breakfast was delicious with friendly waiters /waitresses .. I can recommend the vegetarian breakfast!! Had a lovely massage and went for an early morning swim and sauna … very clean spa , dressing gowns provided in the bedroom for this Great location with a lovely view of Elizabeth Castle About a 15 mins walk to the main town area Bus stop across the road -only £2.10 back to the airport Would highly recommend this hotel and would love to visit again one day"
4583,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Very pleasant staff especially the breakfast crew. Well stocked cold selection and lots of coffee. Hit good was ordered but it wasn’t that hot but I still enjoyed it. Slept well and the rooms were warm. Bus stop very close by all in all a very happy stay
4584,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Beuatiful traditional property with idyllic setting across from the bay. If you need to be bang in centre then would avoid although the walk is a short 10 mins away. Bed quality was exceptional and breakfast was to a high standard. The deluxe room has a beautiful view and the aesthetics of the room were very warm and cosy Unusual way to get to the spa however there is a nice gym, with jacuzzi, steam sauna and pool. Champagne bar has good atmosphere and staff are generally very helpful. Normally stay at the Royal Yacht but will stay here in the future even though it is a slightly longer walk."
4585,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Can’t fault it. Staff were superb. Breakfast perfect. Rooms modern and comfortable and - because it’s January I guess - the deal was very good. Surely the most enjoyable and relaxing hotel stay for a long time. First time visit. We will return.
4586,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,From the moment you arrive until the moment you leave the staff are wonderful friendly and attentive and the accomodation is fantastic. When you arrive your case is taken to the room check in staff are first class and provide you with all the information you want. Breakfast is great you can use the buffet and/or have your own meal prepared. We went also for afternoon tea which was excellent value. Look no further for a hotel in Jersey.
4587,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Very nice hotel with wonderful staff. Elegance with a home from home feeling. Breakfast buffet was very good. Room was very comfortable and clean. Excellent location, just across from St.Aubin Bay and easy to reach St.Helier town centre."
4588,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Excellent hotel and service. Stayed for three nights on business. Had an inland room which was luxurious and spotless. Dinner was excellent. Service in all areas was exceptional. They really know how to make you welcome. Top notch all round.
4589,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Hello, Poppy Labrador here, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who made my recent stay so wooftastic. My room was amazing, I know I probably shouldn’t have done but I climbed up on the chair as it had my rug on it and I could see straight out to st aubins bay & Elizabeth castle, it was one of the best rooms I’ve sniffed round, especially the little balcony too! My human friend had their own bedroom and I snoozed in the lounge, we both had a great time. The hotel is great for 13 year old Labrador’s like me, there is a park right next door, and just over the road there is a huge beach and the sea, I went paddling everyday, it was so much fun for an old Labrador. My human friend left me to snooze in the room one night and he said the tasting menu in the Tassili restaurant…"
4590,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,Spent three nights here in October and would definitely recommend. Excellent service from a friendly and well trained staff. Top quality and immaculate facilities including the spa. Loved the fantastic breakfast delivered to our room each morning! A beautiful setting looking out to Elizabeth Castle.
4591,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Another great Handpicked Hotel, further complemented by the amazing staff! We loved that they greeted our son by name every time we walked through the lobby. We had booked a Superior Ocean View Room but were surprised to find we had been upgraded to the St Brelade Suite – wow! The room was immaculate, with separate lounge and WC, and the bathroom looked newly refurbished with freestanding bath and standalone shower. The extra space was a godsend with our son and also meant we could put him to bed in one room and stay up a bit a later ourselves in another. The cot was already waiting for us in the room with bedding, plus milk in the fridge. The suite is on a corner so you get dual aspect views, looking over Elizabeth Castle and St Aubin’s Bay, great to wake up to, and great…"
4592,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,I just want to say a huge thank you to Luis and his team for making the Halloween afternoon tea today so special for my daughter and also for us adults. Luis provided such fun entertainment from the moment we walked into the hotel and this really made the day. The rest of the team made sure we had everything we needed and the afternoon tea was outstanding! The children’s afternoon tea was so cleverly put together and my daughter absolutely loved the candy floss! Luis then provided more entertainment which all the children thoroughly enjoyed. My daughter told me that was the best Halloween treat! Thank you for making it so special - looking forward to more family events with you!
4593,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"We had a meal in the Champagne Bar on Saturday 22/10, this was a celebration meal for my Mom's 80th Birthday. Our waitress (Catherine) was amazing, she remembered everyone's name and made our whole evening that little bit more special. All the staff were helpful and made you feel very welcome. We could not fault anything from the service to the food quality. If we return to Jersey in the future the Grand would be our preferred destination."
4594,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"From the moment we were greeted by the concierge Paul, to checking out we were made so welcome in all areas of the hotel and spa. Firstly we were upgraded to a lovely sea view room (101) and as it was my birthday it was a real treat. Our room was well equipped with plenty of space and extreamly comfortable bed. Facing the sea and Elizabeth castle was super, despite the double glazing there is still quite a lot of noise from the very busy road below. You can however, open the window and side door which was good. Air con very efficient and nice large tv. Coffee machine and tea making facilities with fridge stocked with fresh milk and water replenished daily. Bathroom was good, with bath, shower over. We ate in the main restaurant on our first evening which was very good, and in…"
4595,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Really difficult to criticise anything in this hotel, the staff, the breakfast, the room, the swimming pool. All were perfect. Parking is limited. There is a Morrisons literally round the corner if you want a snack and don’t wish to use the hotel. Location is amazing. Minutes fro the ferry port"
4596,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Amazing hotel, staff were all really nice and helpful. Daily breakfast each morning was very good. Spa and swimming facilities very nice. Great location on sea front and will defo be returning. Thanks for a great stay"
4597,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"Husband and I have just returned from the most lovely weeks holiday in Jersey, staying here. We could not have been happier with our room, and the hotel is lovely to look around. I note some of the complaints of it not being 5 star, and having an industrial feel when looking out of the window, which was the view we had, but for the price we paid, I was amazed at what we got for our money! I knew we weren't going to get a sea view so I was not expecting anything like that. Our room was just lovely and was cleaned every day ( or so it seemed). The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept in and I would like to know where to get the mattress cover/ saver as we want the EXACT ones! We had plenty of tea, coffee, milk etc every day and there was everything we could…"
4598,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"What a lovely hotel. The rooms are very clean, the food in the Champagne Lounge was lovely and breakfasts were good - either waitress or self service. The staff were all very friendly and helpful, but especially mention must be made of Jamin and Winley who were exceptional. The hotel is very well situated and, although parking appeared to be inadequate we did manage to find a space when we needed it."
4599,Grand Jersey Hotel & Spa,"My experience was not five star. The room had the most horrendous industrial outlook onto concrete, steel, air conditioning pipes and rubbish bins. Terribly noisy above at night and you can hear other residents performing their ablutions. TV noises from adjacent rooms. Grubby surfaces -unhygienic and in the days of covid dangerous. It is amidst the hub of St Helier adjacent to a very busy dual carriageway. Cannot possibly recommend."
4600,Casa Hotel,"Experience from check in to check out was seamless. The hotel is very well presented throughout, the room was comfortable with plenty of power sockets, good wi-fi, a good sized TV, a very nicely laid out shower room. The restaurant was superb, both dinner and breakfast the following day being excellent. Great wine choice for dinner. Highly recommended!!!"
4601,Casa Hotel,"Booked five rooms for a sales meeting, alongside a separate meeting room and it was faultless. Firstly its easy to find with loads of parking, and check in was a breeze. The rooms are large and bright with air conditioning, and the breakfast was excellent."
4602,Casa Hotel,Absolutely amazing service the staff went above and beyond to make my sons wedding the best it could be .the hospitality and service were amazing the food was fabulous tge staff were excellent xx
4603,Casa Hotel,"My partner and I visited for the second time cocina restaurant served by Emily.Excellent service by her she was so helpful,polite,welcoming nothing was too much trouble and we felt that she went out of her way to help us .as to have an enjoyable evening as we are disabled. We ordered sirloin steak and it was cooked to perfection We had an amazing evening Mark and Mayte"
4604,Casa Hotel,"Me and my wife ended up at Casa by accident. After dropping our hired van we wandered over to KFC but we turned around and left within 30 seconds. It was bad in so many ways and deserves its own (one star) review. We saw Casa in the distance. We walked in and a female member of staff was leaving having just finished her shift. She passed us saying 'hello'. We exchanged a few polite words and she turned around and guided us to our seat in the Tapas Bar telling us that she would get the chef to come back on duty after he had already finished, and recommended a couple of items off the menu. Come on, how many times have you seen hospitality staff return to serve the customer when they are off the clock! The young Spanish-born waiter took over and he was a delight. Friendly and…"
4605,Casa Hotel,"Really clean, comfortable hotel with a decent breakfast. The location is a little out of town so if you don't have a car get a taxi (around £5-6) or a 25 min walk from the train station. However it's right opposite a huge Tesco if you need anything!"
4606,Casa Hotel,"We recently stayed at the casa, cannot fault this hotel at all, from the room to the staff, everything was exceptional, the reception girls were fantastic and extremely helpful. The bar staff were also fantastic as were the night management. Highly recommend and will definitely be back"
4607,Casa Hotel,"Such a lovely hotel. The staff are absolutely brilliant, the rooms are incredible, lovely and clean and well appointed. The bar is fab, love the tree. Good wine and great olives. Attended a ball which was fabulous. Great food and service! Well done Casa!"
4608,Casa Hotel,"Amazing stay again, as always stunning place & great staff always go above & beyond for our stay. Rooms are spotless & have great facilities, with plenty of clean towels. The food is amazing had a great time celebrating my husbands 50th birthday. Will definitely be booking again."
4609,Casa Hotel,What an amazing stay. We stayed here as part of our wedding at a local venue and they were sooo helpful from beginning to end. With every swap and change they accommodated us in ever way. Staff were lovely and couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast was to die for. We are already planning a trip back eventhough we are local as it really did feel like a luxury staying!!
4610,Casa Hotel,"Excellent reception but no information about breakfast time's and not in room. Room facilities are excellent with fresh milk and fridge provided in room, full range of glasses. The TV guides could do with being check as channels didn't match. Excellent food with great quality but the service is incredibly slow with mains arriving ober 1 hour after starters. Possibly too busy for the team to cope ?? Atmosphere is great, good lightling and rooms clearly labeled and easy to find. Possibly could argue the food offering is quite expensive. On the whole a great hotel which we have been to a few times now and would continue to go back."
4611,Casa Hotel,"What a top notch hotel! Very comfortable rooms, great restaurants & ALL the staff were just so polite, courteous & helpful 👏👏👏 Although situated on a busy road it was the perfect base for exploring The Peak District."
4612,Casa Hotel,"Had a business lunch in the Barca bar, and was impressed at the update they've done with the decor. It's a lovely relaxed environment, and there's a good choice of different types of seating areas. Perhaps the best part of the experience was the fabulous food and super friendly and helpful staff. Thanks, will be back! :)"
4613,Casa Hotel,"Fantastic location, luxurious, clean, soundproof and marvellous breakfast. The staff was courteous and smiling. Cheap charging bays for EVs. Plenty of parking. Wasn’t a cheap option but prices were reasonable with regards to facilities provided. Tesco extra (24 hours) at 5 minutes walk."
4614,Casa Hotel,"A lovely stay in our favourite hotel in Chesterfield, which is so convenient when we visit our relatives. The hotel has had a partial upgrade since we last visited. The bar area is now fully refurbished and has an excellent selection of gins all served by friendly staff. The room is comfortable and on request a suitcase stand was provided very promptly. Breakfast was delicious and beautifully cooked. Great value for money and highly recommended."
4615,Casa Hotel,"The Casa catered for wake and could not do enough to help in every way. The service and food was fantastic huge complimentsto the Chef. Can not fault anything the staff especially reception, bar staff and catering was faultless. The room was spotless and very welcoming. Loved the fridge having complementary fresh milk and water. The bed was so comfy and definitely the best night sleep had in a while. Very impressed with the restaurant for evening meal and breakfast was all incredible. The staff are an absolute credit to Casa could not do enough for you. Thank you"
4616,Casa Hotel,"I decided to eat in their Barca bar for lunch, I had a lovely beetroot & goat cheese salad, it was delicious in every way. Staff were fast & friendly, which is what you need for a lunch break. I decided to have a hot chocolate for afters & it was divine!"
4617,Casa Hotel,"The hotel has a great ambience as soon as you walk through the door. We received a warm welcome from the reception staff and we were checked in quickly and efficiently. The room was comfortable and the shower was great, good food served in the bar and a delicious buffet breakfast - absolutely recommend!"
4618,Casa Hotel,"The Casa is ideally located and offers very comfortable, well-appointed rooms. This was our second stay and -as before - we were impressed by the efficiency and friendliness of the staff. The one criticism of the accommodation is the poor quality of the towels - too small and too flimsy. Not acceptable in an up-market hotel. My other gripe was at breakfast on the Sunday. The selection and choice of buffet or specials from the menu is fine - and the food good - but waiting well over forty minutes for poached eggs and smoked salmon, because room service orders took priority is not very impressive. On the Saturday evening, we dined in the restaurant and were fortunate to experience Tom Marr's cooking. A truly excellent meal and the definite highlight of our stay. Casa is lucky to…"
4619,Casa Hotel,Room was spacious and bed was extremely comfortable. Breakfast was excellent with good quality products. I particularly liked the berries and yogurt as an additional choice. The bread was very tasty and moreish! A very enjoyable stay.
4620,Casa Hotel,"Our first meal at Cocina was simply superb. The finest quality food beautifully presented and served by professional waitresses who looked after us with a smile. The Head Chef Tom really runs a top class restaurant with exceptional menu choices. My party of 12 were thrilled with the seafood / fish dishes particularly with the squid, scallops and an Incredible monkfish bouillabaisse. His turbot main was also top drawer. We had a wonderful table just near the kitchen which was perfect for our group and slightly private. We would unhesitatingly recommend Cocina Restaurant at Casa Hotel Chesterfield for a special celebratory meal. Five of my party were residents and found the hotel of a very high standard. We will return"
4621,Casa Hotel,"This is a good 4 star hotel (assuming you're looking for a comfortable place to spend a night and not a luxury weekend away). Our room was comfortable - a good size, clean, modern. Hot, powerful shower. A couple of minor points - one of the bedside lamps wasn't working (though it didn't bother us), and the Kingside bed seemed to dip in the middle as though two beds had been pushed together. We also had cocktails and tapas in the Barca Bar. The food and drink was excellent, and service mostly good, except for having to wait a while to order in the first place: it was table service, but no-one came over for some time, and had to ask twice before someone took our order. Aside from this, it was a lovely evening. We paid an extra £10 (£5 each) for breakfast on booking and this…"
4622,Casa Hotel,"Friendly helpful staff,, great food ,,clean comfortable room ,,junior suite was great.. Everyone seemed happy to work there and took as much time and interest with us as they did with events etc so highly recomend"
4623,Casa Hotel,Great hotel but I’ve never understood why it takes so long to check in despite having stayed at the hotel since it first opened.Why do they NEVER remember/record that you’ve stayed there before? Surely repeat business is important. And why do I need to write 200 characters 🤬
4624,Casa Hotel,"Went to the Barca Bar with family. Everyone was impressed with the staff, food and atmosphere. We all enjoyed the Tapas as well as the excellent service provided by the Barca Team, especially Jai who made sure my family were looked after and enjoyed themselves for the night. He is an absolute credit to the Bar as well as all the other members of the Barca Team. Would definitely recommend!"
4625,Casa Hotel,"My friend and I visited your Bar today for lunch. We were impressed with the decor and ambiance. We ordered the club sandwich, which was delicious. Our server ( Kai) was a delightful young man, so cheerful and polite. We will definitely return! Thank you Kai."
4626,Casa Hotel,"Let me start by saying we did have a lovely time but the price tag and stars dictates the review. We were staying in the spa room with its own sauna and hot tub. This is a fabulous idea for a special occasion. With the price tag you would expect perfection. It was clean but there was debris from the previous occupants (clothes tags), there were scrapes and marks on the walls. The mirrors were smudged. There was a coffee machine but only two expresso and one americano pod. I would have thought a latte or cappuccino and a few more would have been better. Please however understand there was a kettle as well with usual coffee/tea. It stated there were slippers but none in the room. As it was a frosty night you then had to walk across the freezing tiled floor to get to…"
4627,Casa Hotel,The Casa Hotel in Chesterfield is the best hotel in the area. The rooms are very comfortable and have all the amenities you expect in a 4 star hotel. The staff are very friendly and really make sure you have everything you need for a pleasant stay. There is a bar which is well stocked and a restaurant where breakfast is Buffett and also made to order. If in the area again we would definitely stay here.
4628,Casa Hotel,"After a warm welcome, we made our way to the 4 floor to our room, once inside we found everything we needed, plus it was clean with a fresh aroma. Our bathroom was very clean and spacious, the late bar was enjoyable with good drinks menu. Breakfast was very good overall a great weekend and experience."
4629,Casa Hotel,"I can honestly say the best hotel I've ever stopped in. To start the review off at half 9 on Saturday morning I called in to ask the staff if they would be able to put the flowers that I had bought my fiancee for valentines day in the room as a surprise. They replied that they would be able to and sorted it all out for me. When me and my partner returned at 2.30pm ish to checked in to a suite with hot tub and sauna, the reception staff was extremely friendly as they checked us in and asked went though our detailsof our booking ie that we had breakfast when it was served all that stuff. Went down to the Barca bar at half 4 for some drinks before we went out for a meal outside of the hotel. The bar staff was really friendly. The bar area was very clean (they had just had football…"
4630,Casa Hotel,"Fantastic hotel, real gem that I stumbled across on Google, really friendly staff with a personal touch! Breakfast was wonderful with all locally sourced produce! Well-appointed room and all at a very affordable price."
4631,Casa Hotel,"Staying in a large suite 235. Impressed to walk in the room. It's clean, huge and nicely decorated. However, I booked the room so I could work while staying and the wifi is worse than a 3g phone, probably the worst I have ever experienced in a hotel. The room temperature cannot be changed with the thermostat and there are 6 lanes of traffic outside the window with poor sound proofing. It could have been good but certainly, bang average with all things considered."
4632,Casa Hotel,"We stayed here for a family event and I can’t rate it highly enough. The rooms were lovely, the food was excellent t and the staff went out of their way to make everyone’s stay perfect. They have free parking and their bar stays open all hours - top marks"
4633,Casa Hotel,"FANTASTIC HOTEL. The best and most friendly staff, could not fault it. Highly recommend! We had the loveliest stay. Room was great and we had everything we needed. Nothing was too much trouble. I would definitely stay again!"
4634,Casa Hotel,"We've stayed at the hotel quite a few times this year and on a couple of occasions we've also taken an extra room for our daughter. Sadly I can honestly say that each time we stay there is an issue with the room. A/C not working - reported and promised to be looked at, nothing happened. Lights not working - reported/nothing Shower water pressure - non-existent Shower - no hot water. I stay there because it should be the nicest hotel in Chesterfield. The bar/restaurant are both nice but there's always, always an issue with the room. For £150/night it's just not worth it. Just think about that - £150 and I can't even get hot water/AC or a decent shower. I also do not feel that when we report the issues to the front staff that anything actually happens."
4635,Casa Hotel,"Excellent value, comfortable room, large bed with fresh and crisp bedding, nice and clean, professional and polite staff, nice breakfast and no surprises. Looks like it has good facilities and plenty of parking even if the spaces are quite tight. Some EV charge options would be nice but not essential. Would definitely stay here again."
4636,Casa Hotel,Walked in to an impressive reception and a warm friendly welcome with the team helping us bring in a large amount of equipment and luggage. Rooms are large and luxurious and all areas of the hotel have wonderful unusual decor …breakfast was superb …highly recommend!
4637,Casa Hotel,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Casa last night. I have stayed several times before and this stay again did not disappoint. From the check in through to checkout it was exceptional. The staff throughout the hotel were so welcoming and went over and above to make sure the stay was the best it could be. The team in Cocina were exceptional as was the food. The Barca Bar too did not disappoint and the choice of drinks really is worlds apart from any other bar in the area. The room was extremely comfortable and I always enjoy the fresh milk in the fridge when making a brew in the room! Breakfast first class as ever! Thank you Casa for a great stay, the Christmas Decorations are excellent too! I will be back!"
4638,Casa Hotel,"Barca Bar has amazing relaxing decor, pretty twinkly lights, very modern and Jai the Barman is SO friendly, welcoming and makes great cocktails 👌🏼 Goes out of his way to provide an exceptional customer experience. Highly recommend! Especially his twist on the classic Cosmopolitan 🍸 #sweet!"
4639,Casa Hotel,Food was fabulous. Staff were attentive and helpful. bottles of water in the room amd a bottle of milk in the room fridge were well received rather than the typical milk cartons left at room temperature. The hotel was set for Christmas and looked lovely
4640,Casa Hotel,"What a great hotel. Met by friendly reception staff. Rooms are lovely, very comfy bed, good powerful shower, everywhere nice and clean. Restaurant, can't fault it. The food is gorgeous and all staff are very polite, friendly and helpful. Brilliant place to stay."
4641,Casa Hotel,"Well located close to train station. Nice rooms and in house restaurants. Small but ok fitness room (although one treadmill was out of service). Small but fresh and nice breakfast selection, both continental and English traditional. Friendly staff."
4642,Casa Hotel,"My favourite place for a working lunch, great food and coffee backed up with brilliant service, give them a try and you will not be disappointed, I have never had a business associate complain and are always complementary."
4643,Casa Hotel,We had a lovely overnight stay for my partners birthday. Excellent service with a thoughtful text from reception to check we were happy with the room (we were) and a birthday card. The restaurant was fantastic and if I lived nearer I’d go for dinner regularly. Connected to a local farm you could certainly tell that the chefs are fussy about their produce and it looks very high end. Lovely atmosphere. I booked last minute on spec and was a little disappointed to find it was on a ring road (which they can’t help) but once you’re inside it’s so nice it doesn’t matter. It’s a while since I’ve stayed somewhere where the team really seemed focused but n delivering a great experience. Breakfast was a little chaotic as I had to reorder my cooked food but by that point it didn’t really…
4644,Casa Hotel,"Hotel was very well presented. Room furniture seemed new. In the bathroom, there was a lovely walk in shower and a night light came on under washbasin as you opened the bathroom door. Dinner was excellent but slightly expensive. Staff were very friendly."
4645,Casa Hotel,Lovely hotel just outside the centre of Chesterfield. Within walking distance of a retail park. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Loved the Spanish themed decor and tapas menu in the bar. Would definitely stay there again.
4646,Casa Hotel,"What a lovely place. The staff are really helpful and friendly, the rooms are well equipped and comfortable and I had a really good night's sleep. The next morning, the breakfast was delicious, best sausages I've tasted for ages! Would definitely return and recommend."
4647,Casa Hotel,"The hotel has been the crowning jewel in an extensive 20+ week stay working away. The staff are perfect, personable, helpful and always warm and welcoming. The tapas bar is the place to relax and eat."
4648,Casa Hotel,"Evening Ladies Festival food, main meal was not hot and beef quite tough two on our table had risotto and they both left most of it. Men upset on our table because there was no draft bitter or Guinness on tap and on tap cider was cherry flavour? Only bottled beer and tinned Guinness available. Told it was a Spanish hotel and therefore did not cater for British tastes. Bedrooms and cleanliness were very good and staff at reception friendly and helpful. Would stay here again but would drink and dine locally"
4649,Casa Hotel,"Perfect for a quick overnight for a business night dinner. Room had everything we needed, including iron and ironing board. All amenities in room perfectly situated, very good shower and plug locations. Bed very comfy, pillows not quite as much. Nice toiletries and very clean and well designed. Car park free at weekends and straight out the front. Dont go for the view !! Buffet breakfast very good, plenty of choice. All staff very attentive throughout, Jamie-Lee very helpful receptionist, would happily stop again"
4650,The Arden Hotel,"Have stayed here in the past but not for some years. Its a fantastic location for the town and the RSC theatre. Everything is walkable. Free parking with complimentary EV chargers. However, they did nothing about non EV cars using those spaces. They should work out a way to keep them for EV cars. The reception area has been decorated since we were last there and its very welcoming and nice. All the staff we interacted with were excellent. Stayed in a classic room. Decent enough size for a short stay with a bit of a view over the front to river and RSC. Bathroom a tad tight to manoeuvre around. Comfy bed and pillows. Just a bit of TLC required, a handyman would sort it in a few hours. At the price point a little bit of maintenance would be good. Breakfast was very good. Decent…"
4651,The Arden Hotel,"Went here for afternoon tea with a friend for our birthdays The sandwiches were okay nothing exciting or different and a nice sausage roll slice Scones again were okay, not enough jam or cream for them and they were quite dry Cakes were again okay but the chocolate orange delice was lovely Really nice loose leaf tea and nice to have juice included We were told they would come around and refresh this of which they came round once early on and then it was like the staff had disappeared we had to go to the bar to ask for the bill For £33 (including a service charge not mentioned on the menu and not warranted in my opinion) there are much better afternoon teas you can go for which you get a bigger selection of things at a better quality too"
4652,The Arden Hotel,We stayed here for 2 nights recently. We had a lovely bedroom with a separate dressing room and super big bathroom with bath and walk in shower. Large fluffy towels. Comfortable bed. All of the staff were wonderful - nothing was too much trouble for them from the moment we arrived until we left. I would happily stay in this hotel again.
4653,The Arden Hotel,Visited today for afternoon tea. Was faultless. Alex.r served us and was so welcoming and helpful. Food and drink were amazing. Will be telling everyone to visit. We had a wonderful time. We will be going for food on a regular basis . 10/10 for sure
4654,The Arden Hotel,"We celebrated a special birthday at The Arden Hotel and enjoyed their delicious afternoon tea which was so beautifully presented by the attentive and friendly staff. Such a relaxing experience, one we will look forward again when we next visit Stratford in the Spring."
4655,The Arden Hotel,"This was my 2nd visit to the hotel in 2022 and just like on the 1st occasion my friend and I had a fantastic stay. Nothing was too much trouble for the very friendly staff. The facilities were all first class and the breakfasts were superb. As many people have already mentioned, this hotel is in a superb position for visiting Stratford with the benefit of a large secure car park. I look forward to another stay when I next return to Stratford."
4656,The Arden Hotel,"Superb service. I am gluten free and they took great care to give us a menu tailored to our needs when attending their New Year's Eve Party. Staff were so attentive, efficient, pleasant service. They looked to be enjoying their work. They made the occasion very enjoyable."
4657,The Arden Hotel,"Stayed as part of a dinner/B&B/theatre package which was excellent value. Our room was very large, well appointed but had a broken light over the shower which the reception staff tried to fix but it needed an electrician. Otherwise, everything was great - quiet, comfortable, hot shower, good restaurant"
4658,The Arden Hotel,"A lovely warm welcome from reception staff, although there was a minor issue with my booking but no fault of theirs but all sorted without any problems, just incurred an additional charge but not a problem. We were shown to our room through a slight warren of corridors. The room & bathroom were extremely roomy, we were shown where hospitality tray was located, along with the fridge, hairdryer etc. Lovely quality complimentary shower gel, shampoo etc. I was asked via an online concierge form for any additional requirements, so asked for bathrobes, slippers & feather pillows, which were all in the room. Everything was spotlessly clean, however on closer inspection, there were some issues which were noticeable on check out day (see photos). Breakfast was lovely, all cooked…"
4659,The Arden Hotel,"Fabulous afternoon tea with my son who is 26, far from a teen visiting from Australia having many fond childhood memories of Stratford. The waitress Mary was so attentive and professional she was kind and made sure our experience was a memorable one! Thank you all at the Arden, your hospitality was amazing"
4660,The Arden Hotel,"We love the proactive and supportive nature of the staff at the Arden. We love its proximity to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and its excellent parking. We love the well-appointed rooms and comfy beds, but wish the taps were a bit more user-friendly to less mobile hands! The in-house restaurant is excellent with very good food and good service too. Perfect scrambled eggs for breakfast. And then there’s the cocktail menu! Best place to stay in Stratford IMO and its sister hotel Brockencote Hall is also well worth a visit."
4661,The Arden Hotel,"I took a small group of business colleagues for an Executive meeting. We all found the staff to be very welcoming and friendly - nothing was too much trouble. The bedrooms were very comfortable and everyone slept well. We had the Christmas menu which was very tasty and well presented. It is a great location in Stratford, right by the theatre with the lovely town just a few minutes away by foot."
4662,The Arden Hotel,"The staff here were super - thank you. We stayed with our elderly mother and the staff were so kind and supportive. The people on reception who operated the access lift, the chap who drove her mobility scooter along the road around the hotel to reception and the thoughtful waiting staff all worth a mention. Their attention to detail was excellent."
4663,The Arden Hotel,We went for afternoon tea at The Arden for a special occasion. It was a really wonderful experience! Our charismatic and lovely waitress Alex made it particularly special. She was attentive efficient and very friendly. The sofas were comfortable and the room was beautiful. The tea itself was absolutely delectable. We weren't hurried at all - and had as much tea as we wanted. We can't wait to go again!
4664,The Arden Hotel,"I have been fortunate enough to have afternoon tea at several places over the last few months - The Arrow Mill, The Lygon Arms, Ettington Park and The Arden. I won’t be returning to the Arden! If you are looking for a cafeteria style vibe then the Arden is for you. If you are looking for the kind of luxury surroundings and vibe the price would usually warrant then I would go somewhere else. I wasn’t offered a choice of tea and there were only 3, fairly boring sandwiches, rather than the usual 4. And before I receive a waspish reply back from the hotel pointing out that there was also a sausage roll, this is true, and my husband did enjoy it. However, a tart or sausage roll has become standard on the level of afternoon tea this is trying to be - and you still get 4 sandwiches.…"
4665,The Arden Hotel,"Excellent hotel, very clean and comfortable. Good size rooms. Friendly and supportive staff. We had my 93 year old mother with us, and the staff were very good attending to her needs and slightly slower pace, and in particular Alex R."
4666,The Arden Hotel,After staying at Arden. I feel I need to share my experience after staying there last night. This is the third time I’ve stayed and the worst. The hotel is looking very tired. With ripped towels with make up marks on. Bath robes That have seen better days. Mould in the inside of the window. And having a invoice slipped under the door for £9 which was an optional charge??? When I asked Peter at reception. ( who’s really helpful) I said I was disappointed of this extra charge. When we had no extra services. Apart from calling reception for a taxi. I said I wouldn’t pay the charge . It’s left a bitter taste. And I won’t be going back. That saddens me because it used to be a really lovely hotel.
4667,The Arden Hotel,"This is a lovely hotel in a perfect location near the river. It is very close to many restaurants, bars, shops and tourist attractions. The hotel staff are friendly, professional and attentive. The hotel decor is a pleasant mix of modern and classic and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious (ours was a superior city view which overlooked the RSC and the river). There was a great choice for breakfast and the food was delicious and well presented. We would definitely recommend the Arden Hotel if you’re looking for somewhere to stay in Stratford upon Avon."
4668,The Arden Hotel,Cosy yet luxurious private space for a team of 9 ladies to enjoy a delicious Afternoon Tea with a glass of bubbles. Very attentive service - thank you for looking after us Alex R. Huge thank you to the team at The Arden Hotel thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon and look forward to the next one.
4669,The Arden Hotel,"We visited The no.44 Restaurant for Afternoon Tea. The staff we’re all so welcoming, friendly and couldn’t do enough for you. The restaurant area is so clean and lovely, we got the choice of where we would like to sit. Great selection on the afternoon tea of sandwiches, sausage roll, cakes and scones with cream and jam. So worth visiting and will defiantly be back."
4670,The Arden Hotel,Sometimes the actions of a hotel prior to arrival or booking are an indication to be taken on board of what might follow. Around 3.00PM a day or two ago I phoned to make an inquiry prior to booking for two nights. After about 30 seconds or more the call not being answered I hung up. OK; such things can happen so I submitted the hotel`s inquiry page with that observation and a request about my intended dates. I had expected a response by phone or e mail. I heard nothing. Seems this hotel doesn`t care whether a traveller books accommodation or not.
4671,The Arden Hotel,"Booked an evening dinner at this lovely Hotel and we were not disappointed. The service was impeccable and charming (as always) and the food was absolutely delicious. The food presentation was so beautifully done and the steak was cooked to perfection. We live local and very often stop by at The Arden to sit on their lovely terrace for a drink, and now we will certainly make dinner a regular occurrence. Thank you to everyone, we really love this place and would definitely recommend it."
4672,The Arden Hotel,"This is a little gem of a hotel. Right in the town centre, ver the road from the RSC and with parking. I had a confusion over the booking which they could have enforced with extra costs for us, but they graciously agreed to waive these. Very friendly and helpful staff too. Also gods vfm. We’ll certainly go again."
4673,The Arden Hotel,"Very pretty hotel with great parking and location for the town centre. Above and beyond customer service for guests. My family had a wake here which the staff handled excellently and ensured everything ran very smoothly. Unfortunately, after leaving the hotel I realised I had left some important, sentimental items in my room. Luckily this was taken care of by Alexandra who dealt with this in such a kind and understanding manner and made sure these were returned to me as quickly as possible. Overall have been left with a great experience and impression from this hotel and will certainly be returning."
4674,The Arden Hotel,"We stayed here 3 weeks ago and wanted to bring friends from Scotland to visit Stratford this last weekend, but unfortunately the Arden was fully booked. We came for dinner, as we knew how good it had been when we were guests. All I can say is fabulous! The restaurant & bar staff were all so pleasant & attentive. Alex was one of our waiters and has to be one of the funniest guys I’ve ever met - he read that our group had a sense of humour & made us all giggle. He’s a massive credit. The food was just ace, and I definitely recommend the scallops to start, and the Ribeye. We’ll definitely be back, thanks all 🙂"
4675,The Arden Hotel,"Visited for afternoon tea whilst on a day trip to Stratford Upon Avon, I had to phone a few times for various reasons before we actually visited and each time my calls were handled in a polite and friendly manner, when we visited, all of the members of the Arden Hotel that we came into contact with were very welcoming and again, friendly and polite. The afternoon tea was lovely and served in their beautiful venue. I would definitely recommend a visit to the Arden Hotel to others."
4676,The Arden Hotel,"The hotel is ideally situated for the town and the theatre. There is ample free parking too. The reception are very welcoming and the rooms are of a good size in the main hotel. Facilities good, but decoration ids a bit old and needs attention. Food excellent including the breakfast but at £20 you would expect a reasonable start to the day. The hidden surcharge of 5% isn’t made clear and for the level of service is frankly a bit of an insult. Overall good location, friendly staff but priced a little high for what is a nice but not great hotel. Beware the hidden costs."
4677,The Arden Hotel,"Lovely hotel with helpful staff. We stayed one night and had an afternoon tea which was very good. The evening meal was fine. The room was comfortable and we had no complaints until it came to breakfast, don’t bother it was a rip off. £44 for two breakfast which comprised of one full English, one porridge, three slices of toast with marmalade and a pot of tea. At half the price it would still be expensive. Very disappointed after an enjoyable in Stratford."
4678,The Arden Hotel,"Stayed for one night. The hotel is right in the centre of the town and opposite the river. We had a feature room which was large and very comfortable.. we ate dinner in the hotel restaurant, which was very good and all very fresh. Breakfast was also good."
4679,The Arden Hotel,"We were bought an afternoon tea (and river cruise) as a present. The tea at The Arden was excellent. Great service, lovely location, home cooked food, no rushing and complimentary parking in their big car park. They were happy for us to stay parked whilst we explored Stratford, just needing the exit code from reception to leave the car park. The hotel grounds were beautiful and a sun trap."
4680,The Arden Hotel,"We’ve just had a faultless three night stay at The Arden. The hotel appears to be extremely well organised. The staff were very friendly and attentive; we were greeted by smiling faces throughout our stay. We found the food to be excellent and well presented in the restaurant (breakfast only), and we also enjoyed having a drink in the attractive garden when we returned to the hotel in the afternoons, or before we ventured out for dinner. Our spacious bedroom was very nice with all the usual amenities; a large bathroom was an added advantage. The air conditioning working very well - so important in the last few days! Other than Ann Hathaway’s cottage (open-decked bus) we walked everywhere because the hotel is so central, and there are are several excellent restaurants on…"
4681,The Arden Hotel,My wife and I stay in Stratford at least once a month during summer months. We had never stayed here but thought we would give it a try. Due to the price ( compared to other hotels in the area ) I was expecting more. Nice hotel. Staff where brilliant allround. Breakfast very good. Downsides where no ironing facilities in room. Had a bill slipped under door on the morning we where leaving for a 5% service charge ??? When I questioned this at reception they told me it was a new charge for the staff ? I was told nothing about this. It’s an expensive place as it is. Just greed. I wouldn’t stay here again. I’ll stick to crown plaza in future. Much better value
4682,The Arden Hotel,"A strange experience, not the normal friendly experience we have had here, we have stayed many times it was our special treat place and often meals, afternoon teas and drinks in a special part of Stratford upon Avon over the years Arrival, name repeated .. 3 times…. Welcome very stiff as if you are not really wanted there Sated down, waited and waited, considering only 2 other people in the restaurant and 3 out on the terrace eventually more people came and they also had a frosty reception Asked if they had vouchers for their afternoon tea I think they should stop selling vouchers as they don’t like them being used, I have them as a gift from ours sons at Christmas and other celebrations but this last experience I will not have any more, £65 bill and a £100 voucher and told…"
4683,The Arden Hotel,"We were given an Afternoon Tea Experience as a present at this Hotel and we would like to say that it was smashing. They catered for a pescatarian as well. Three small sandwiches each, two scones and all the trimmings, as well as little cakes. To drink we had OJ and then a Pot of Tea. But the best of all was the service and attention by the staff and especially Grace who was very helpful indeed. Thank you Arden and Thank you Grace."
4684,The Arden Hotel,"As we are local we visited the Arden Hotel for a drink as only two of the outside tables on the terrace were in use. Once we had found a way in (the terrace gate was barred) we were politely told that we needed to reserve in advance. Strange, the place looked empty! We went to the Dirty Duck just up the road and enjoyed great hospitality. On walking back past the Arden it was still almost empty. They obviously don’t want customers, certainly not passing custom, it’s a strange situation indeed."
4685,The Arden Hotel,"Didn’t stay but I travelled to this area from Wakefield, my car broke down and I’ve been stuck here two days, I was approached by a lovely member of staff called Alicia. She offered parking to leave the car overnight so I didn’t get another ticket. Extremely polite and offered us inside for a drink until our lift home arrived from 2 hours away. We were then introduced to Mehmet, amazing person and really down to earth bringing his politeness skills and looking after us. Could not recommend this location enough. Once my car is sorted we will definitely be revisiting and staying for the weekend. Unbelievably clean hotel, beautiful rooms and customer service. Thank you so much guys! We appreciate everything you have done for us!"
4686,The Arden Hotel,We really enjoyed our stay recently at the Arden. Everything was very clean and the staff were very friendly. Food was lovely too and special shout out to Hussein in the restaurant who was very welcoming. The hotel is in a fabulous location with the town very close by and our room looked out onto the RSC theatre and views of the river. Would definitely recommend.
4687,The Arden Hotel,"My wife and I live locally and decided to have a couple of drinks in town before dinner. It was a rare outing out for us without the children so we really wanted to have a nice experience. We thought we’d have a drink outside the Arden Hotel on their nice terrace (we got married in a sister hotel of theirs, plus it was our wedding anniversary the weekend in question). We arrived around 5.45pm and the terrace was empty save for two tables. We found an empty table in the sunshine but it was dirty and hadn’t been cleared up from before (there were plenty of staff around twiddling their thumbs). My wife went to order some drinks but was told that we couldn’t be served as we weren’t residents. This was a really officious and dogmatic attitude to take by the hotel: it wasn’t as if…"
4688,The Arden Hotel,My husband and I had afternoon tea at the Arden yesterday as part of a Virgin experience day. We were made to feel very welcome by the lovely reception and waiting staff and were looked after very well. The tea was delicious and plentiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon. Intend to visit again.
4689,The Arden Hotel,"Lovely hotel in perfect position for sightseeing and theatre. Beautiful spacious deluxe room , clean and tidy., very comfortable bed and lovely and quiet.Lovely gardens and outside seating area. Overall beautifully decorated hotel. Staff were outstanding, friendly and amazing customer service."
4690,The Arden Hotel,"Excellent service throughout our stay. Most comfortable bed ever, central position for town yet perfect peace and quiet. The lady on reception was really friendly. Hot plentiful breakfast which we couldn't fault. Will return and hopefully enjoy the garden!"
4691,The Arden Hotel,This hotel is faultless . From the arrival when unusually for these days our luggage was taken to our room and we were shown our room to departure the next day the service was excellent. The room was lovely and spacious and thoughtfully equipped. The decor is nice and stylish . Bathroom was big with lots of storage . Bed was big and comfortable although the bedside light was poor for reading. Dinner was good although the £25 allowance only really paid for a main course but the free drink with our deal was a bonus . Breakfast was excellent too. The hotel has a lovely garden and it’s very central plus the free parking is great! One bar was closed for renovations but should be a nice addition to this characterful hotel . My only gripe was the vase of DEAD tulips in the…
4692,The Arden Hotel,"Very comfortable hotel in great location opposite the RSC and very close to all the attractions. Good sized rooms, great breakfast and very friendly staff. Well worth booking if paying a visit to historic Stratford. We enjoyed our overnight stay. The thing lacking would be a gym or pool"
4693,The Arden Hotel,Visited the Arden hotel on Good Friday 15/04/22 to have lunch on their beautiful terraced restaurant on a beautiful sunny day. We were received and looked after by Ashley throughout. Nothing was too much for him. Always smiling and obliging. It was so refreshing to see a man who was obviously enjoying his job and had everything under control. Truly a pleasant day in a pleasant and friendly hotel/ restaurant with delicious food. Thank you Ashley. You are a big credit to your employer. Bijan Shafighian
4694,The Arden Hotel,"Excellent service recieved. Staff was superb. Alicia, jack, Ashleigh the kitchen manager and the night staff were all wonderful. Nothing was too much. Looked after us first class. Would highly recommend the Arden Hotel to friends and family. Would like to thank all the staff for looking ater us."
4695,The Arden Hotel,"At Christmas we received a Virgin Experience voucher for afternoon tea here followed by a boat trip. So we visited in early April. Everything was perfect. We parked in their car park and received the friendliest welcome from the reception staff. The lady who served us was so helpful and explained all our options. The sandwiches, cakes and scones were delicious and plentiful and our coffee and tea pots were topped up twice. There was no rush and the surroundings were charming. It was a real treat and a great present!"
4696,The Arden Hotel,"Visited the Arden Hotel as part of a gift package for an afternoon tea and decided to stay overnight. We had a good on-line price for a superior room including breakfast. Excellent room, nice decour and quality drinks. Breakfast was possibly the best we’ve had in a 4star hotel!! Last, but definitely not least, was the lovely attitude of all the staff, (it would be unfair to single any out) as they were without exception helpful, polite and happy to spend a few minute of their busy time taking an interest in what we had been doing and giving us ideas for a future visit. We will return!!"
4697,The Arden Hotel,"We stayed for two nights, dinner, bed and breakfast, booked through Great Little Breaks. The hotel is ideally located with good parking. The dinner should have been on our first night but the restaurant wasn't open so the hotel moved it to the second night, luckily we were flexible and hadn't made plans for our second night but we were only informed when I emailed a few days before to book dining time. The rooms are lovely and very well equipped. Breakfasts were delicious and plenty of choice. Dinner was a disappointment, incredibly small portions. £25 for what was essentially a small pork loin steak sliced into strips and arranged artfully on the plate with a tiny potato. Overall a good stay but a little expensive for what it was."
4698,The Arden Hotel,"Just returned after from the Arden hotel and I must say we were very impressed. We were greeted by the young man on reception, sorry I didn't his name but he made myself and my husband feel very welcome. The room ( the acer) was immaculate in every way. The breakfast next morning was good, helped ourselves to a good variety of cereals and various fruits. The cooked breakfast was served on nice hot plates and presented lovely. The young lady Alex who served the breakfast was very professional also nice and friendly. When we departed, we spoke to another young lady named Boga on reception who was also very nice and helpful. So overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definately choose the Arden again, could not fault it in any way. So 10/10 to all staff involved. A…"
4699,The Arden Hotel,"Only stayed for one night, but we were impressed by the friendly staff and overall presentation of the hotel. Excellent central situation with good car parking facilities. Hope we can return for a longer stay in the future"
4700,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for a long weekend whilst doing some sight seeing and taking part in a charity event nearby. The room was clean and tidy with a very comfy bed. We were able to take our bicycles into our room for storage without any issue. Only disappointment was having no normal coffee and only decaf for the weekend, just took the edge off a perfect weekend. We've been before and will be back just need to sort the minor issue as it's sometimes the little things that matter. Overall though very good and the staff are very polite and friendly."
4701,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"We stayed in a family room, which was huge and gave us plenty of space. My parents double room was next door and they too had a huge room. Rooms were clean and well presented. The staff were all so friendly, helpful and attentive. Mo looked after us each evening and was lovely, thank you Mo!!! The manager (we think) was also fabulous. Breakfast each morning was delicious with lots of choice and topped up often. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and send thanks to all the staff. People are always so quick to complain, and not compliment, so I hope all the staff can read this and give themselves a Pat on the back. Would be sure to come back and stay here again if we come back to London."
4702,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Surprised by the size of our room. We requested a quiet room and were not disappointed given that it is in central London we could hear a rumble of trains/DLR in the morning but no sirens or traffic. Breakfast with kids eating free was excellent value and good quality.
4703,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Room was double booked, hotel was understaffed, and staff they had were very undertrained. Everyone was pleasant and in fairness the manageress on at the time deserves credit for the firefighting she had to do. Bar and restaurant service was ridiculously slow, food took over an hour from ordering despite restaurant being quiet. Bar service was equally shambolic."
4704,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"We booked this hotel to recoup after completing a 15 mile moonwalk for charity. We arrived back to the hotel 30 mins before restaurant opened for breakfast and didn’t want to return to room before eating as we knew we would collapse so waited in reception. The manager and receptionist kept staring at us and when approach was very rude. We did look a mess so I guess this was an indication of good security. The day staff were friendly and check in easy. Rooms clean and plenty of room. Breakfast was really enjoyable, it did beat the best hotels Iv stayed in London in the past in terms of tastiness and very organised."
4705,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,The staff are what made this place so enjoyable. So so friendly and we're super efficient for the ride london weekend. Banana and bars out in the morning and the option of an early breakfast. Staff were still smiling
4706,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,I was put in room 11 (I was told it was the only room available in the hotel) which was below ground level. The view was as pictured and the room was next to the restaurant. This meant that from around 6am there were people congregating and talking loudly outside the door of the room. It was a generally noisy and depressing experience. The bed also needs replacing. I stayed in a different Premier Inn the next night and the bed was much better. The room was a decent size though.
4707,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Building looked un cared for ,windows to front very dirty .No chance of early check in arrived 2.30pm was told no check-in before 3pm ,despite ,rooms being cleaned from 9.30 in morning ,people who had long journey complaining and asked staff to use some discretion, no chance .Abroad after flight I have checked in at 7.am and 8.30 am no problems ..When we left three rooms had been cleaned in our corridor ,people leaving in front of us told cleaner their room was empty as we did that was 10 am on last day . Room clean and tidy ,bed comfortable ,hot water ,but room view was of bins and pile of rubbish in bags ,Staff use area at back for breaks ,outside constant humming from air con units from building opposite could hear in room .. Restaurant downstairs in basement ,as you…"
4708,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,I recommend this hotel very much! The staff were all kind and eager to help and my bedroom was really cosy! You should definitely book a room here on you next stay in London. And the tube station is a three-minute walk.
4709,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Great hotel,we have stay here whenever we come to London, lovely breakfast, staff really friendly, would recommend staying here for a stay in Central London, great view when you come out of Tower Hill Tube Station of The Tower Of London"
4710,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"The staff at the hotel are great! They greet you with a smile and “hello” as you enter and exit the premises. They are always available to help and answer any questions. The hotel itself is outdated and needs some serious upgrading. Lack of comfortable pillows in the room and access to outlets to charge phones, etc is not sufficient. The website states king beds are available in the standard rooms however that is totally inaccurate. The beds are more of double beds and not very comfortable. If you want a basic place, reasonably priced and be close to major attractions, then this is a good option."
4711,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,We stayed one night as had View from the Shard booked and Lunch on the Thames.. good location hotel for both .. large room… comfy bed.. all you could want from a help yourself breakfast.. pleasant welcoming staff.
4712,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Great location for sightseeing. Very clean hotel with basic facilities as you would expect. Bathroom a little small but perfectly fine. We got a great nice sleep despite facing the street but no traffic noise disturbed us. Breakfast was great. Very fresh , both the hot options and the continental."
4713,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Have stayed a few times now and it’s a great location and I always try to book this when we want to visit London. Stayed 2 nights. Room on 4th floor was very comfortable and so quiet in hotel and no traffic noise! Wetherspoons just down the road for food/drinks and a 5 minute walk to Tower Hill tube. Plenty of tea/coffee etc in reception and you can leave your case so can spend time sightseeing. Love this Premier Inn!
4714,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"This is quite an old Premier inn but was absolutely fine, it was clean, comfortable, friendly staff. Totally fine for a business stay. It was a good location about 5 mins from the tube and the rooms were large. It wasn’t glamorous but we were only in the room 6 hours"
4715,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Although technically all I needed was a bed for the weekend and a hearty breakfast the hotel was great location was fab and easy and I’d definitely stay again next year. Top tip on the coffee don’t have the latte the milk is too cold and ensure you book dinner if you want it in the area otherwise I cannot complain
4716,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"The team is excellent - Duty Manager Elena, team members Mo, Jamaal, Maria... are super friendly and helpful. So sad a superb team let down by one guy at overnight shift (don't even bother to know his name). One extremely rude staff ruined/offset the whole team's hard work."
4717,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Whilst the location is good the room allocated was dark and faced a railway embankment meaning that sleep was disturbed by each passing train - This hotel is a blemish on the brand of Premier Inn - never again!
4718,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Great place to stay eat and enjoy at an affordable price with the luxury of a 5 star hotel.ideal site and location for all the sites of london .we visit time and time again .well worth it .car park just around the corner with security 24/7.
4719,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,The room was very clean and tidy as i expected and the bed was very comfortable. The one thing that spoiled it for me was the fact there was train tracks right outside my window and the noise at times was very annoying to the point where it basically made it hard to get to sleep or it woke me up early in the morning. I probably wouldn't book this particular hotel again
4720,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Room very comfortable, staff sooo friendly, we went to the premier inn as we were visiting London for my daughters 9th birthday! I popped to the bar to ask if I could take a cake in later in the evening when she was having hot chocolate, they said absolutely of course! Little did we know when I was arranging the cake and candles the 2 ladies working in the bar said they would come and sing and surprise her, they came out with balloons and a lovely treat box of chocolates for her! The guy working aswell was also super helpful and wrapped the remainder of her cake in cling film! So much nicer than other hotels we have stayed in in London- Will defiantly return! Thank you so much for making my daughters birthday extra special"
4721,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,When you need customer service and they let you down and fail you miserably by claiming you are basically lying about what happened when you try and claim on their ‘good night sleeps guarantee.’ Very poor and simply no point having them if their remit is to blag their way out of honouring the guarantee when the claim is valid and not listed in the exceptions on their website. Hotel ok but like a lot do now needs refurbishing and the prices are getting ridiculous for some. Simply not what they were and need management to sort otherwise I will be looking elsewhere for another reliable budget chain. Sorry but on this occasion you failed us completely and let us down massively.
4722,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"We couldn’t fault the location. Easy walk to attractions and transport. Staff were really helpful and helped us to change rooms as our first room was not good at all. The hotel is comfortable but feels very dated compared to other premier inns we have stayed in. Tiny TV’s in weird positions and a/c was not great. Bathrooms looked really old - first room was really bad and noisy but second was better. That said, location was good and staff were terrific."
4723,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"As with all Premier Inns,this is good value for money,with comfortable beds,warm rooms and a good nights sleep.The dinner was good and the bar area was nice.The breakfast was very good and the staff were good.The hotel itself is a little tired,but it's location is excellent,a stones throw from the tower of London and tube station."
4724,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"We booked this property because we were going to see Abba Voyage and it is in a perfect position for Tower Gateway DLR station. My friend and I were really happy with the Tower Hill Premier Inn. Every single member of staff we had cause to speak to were friendly and helpful. We had asked for quiet rooms which is a big ask in a city centre hotel. I’m not sure if we just struck lucky but both our rooms 513 and 515 (so 5th floor and that’s the highest floor here) faced an internal “square” which yes, has the big wheelie bins… we stayed from Sunday evening until Tuesday morning and never heard a thing. I had room 515 and I was very, very satisfied. The room cost was brilliant for the Sunday night stay especially. The room was exceptionally clean and the option of softer pillows…"
4725,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"There was no bottled mineral/drinking water provided in the room.The queen bed was very comfortable but the single bed was not comfortable and stable. There was no noise heard eventhough the locatio next to train railway. Overall, stay was very ggod.Definitely will come back for next trip."
4726,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Hotel is well located, 5mins walk from Tower Hill tube and dlr station. As well as the tower and tower bridge. We booked a family room for us and 2 kids. We checked in well after the check in time and they still had to check the room was ready for us. Room was clean, but a little tired. Bathroom needs some TLC, but was still clean. On the second morning g we decided to have breakfast in the hotel, but there was no sign of any breakfast service. No staff or any indication that breakfast was available (apart from all the advertising everywhere!)"
4727,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,I’ve stayed in many premier inns but this was has been the worst I’ve stayed in. Very outdated. The view was facing the rubbish bins. We got woken up at 6am on the morning as the bins was being moved around Which made us very annoyed as we had a busy day head of us. The air con was barley working we did report this to a staff member but nothing was done. The breakfast we had was very disappointing. All the food was dried out like it had been out for hours. Didn’t enjoy it at all. We tried using the Wi-Fi that was available but would never load anything which frustrated. Wouldn’t stay here again. It has also put me off going to another premier inn
4728,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Perfect location for me, nice friendly kitchen staff, with good food. Room very average. No intercom or fridge in the room. Had to go down 3 floors everytime I needed to ask something from reception or order food. Old, worn-out looking carpet. Ancient TV. I expected a lot better for almost £150/night: I suppose I'd paid mostly for the convenient location as I have had just as nice or much nicer rooms for much cheaper elsewhere in London."
4729,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,The staff checking us in were incredibly unhelpful and dismissive. They also stereotyped our party and made us feel uncomfortable in the hotel room that we had paid for. They did this by threatening to remove us from our hotel room in the later evening for groundless accusations
4730,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,The reception is covered the 24 hrs with complementary tea coffee water and snacks 24 hrs too next to a comfortable sitting area Staff is superb and rooms very spacious Worth the stay and with no doubts will come back for sure
4731,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Just a short walk to the Tower of London, the location of this hotel is very convenient for the river cruise we had booked for my elderly mother. The rooms were spotlessly clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful and friendly, going above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed."
4732,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,My wife loves the Tower of London and wanted to share an experience with our children and show them what it was all about. Both our boys loved it and it was the first time in London I didn’t feel stressed we will be returning.
4733,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Not good not poor, visit was just as we expected. it is aa good location , no complaints other than fairly expensive for a travel inn. It is London though and all hotels in London now seem much more expensive than pre-covid ie double stayed 1 night"
4734,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Good basic accommodation from know brand . Everything you'd expect from Premier Inn. Good location for Tower Of London, Tower Bridge, St Katherins Dock underground, busies,boats etc Places to eat are close by, on the whole a nice area of town"
4735,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Room clean, comfortable and surprisingly spacious for London city. You always know what you’ll get with Premier Inn however what made this hotel stand out was the staff. From the moment we checked in nothing was too much trouble. Staff were pleasant, helpful and always with smiles on their faces. I’m quite a reserved person but when we left I felt I needed to speak to the manager to thank her for our lovely stay and pass on my thoughts to the staff. They really did go over and above."
4736,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"This hotel is in a great location, room was spacious and clean. Staff were very friendly. Only thing would have been nice to have a bigger bed rather than a standard double. I would recommend to a friend and would very likely visit again."
4737,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Stayed for 2 nights visiting London. Staff friendly and breakfast up to Premier Inn's usual quality. Overall the hotel was tired looking. Our room was not properly cleaned on arrival; we found rubbish under the bed and in the bin together with a takeaway spork on the window. It was also noisy, due to a nightly alarm in the services shaft. There was also the nearby underground, but this wasn't a problem and can't be helped by the hotel. Not the usual standard you expect from Premier Inn."
4738,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Location was fantastic for the river, St Katherine’s Dock, Tower Bridge, The Tower of London and many more attractions. Nice big friendly PI, super comfy and brilliant staff, no waiting around as they were very proactive at reception as it got busy - over 500 rooms and reasonably priced if you book early. Breakfast as always at PI was lovely and the kids eat free which is a massive perk for us as a party of 4 adults & 3 kids. Can’t fault the place and we’ll be back - thank you"
4739,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Great hotel, fabulous location, The staff were wonderful and nothing was too much trouble. we received excellent service from Jamaal in reception area - he helped us to move rooms and was so friendly and polite - an asset to Premier Inn, Thank you so much!"
4740,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"You know what you are getting with Premier Inns. Good beds, great breakfast, great location for all the London sites all at a reasonable price. Easy to get to and from and the perfect base for our 5 day stay"
4741,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Our bedroom was next the train tracks for a mainline service and the windows were inadequate for keeping out the rumbling noise - they didn't tell you this on the website. The staff weren't particularly friendly or interested in being overly helpful - they did what you asked of them but it was defintely the minimum effort and no smile / welcoming. I thought I'd put the telly on for a bit seeming I couldn't sleep as the trains started running again around 5am - TV didn't work! It was probably the worst Premier Inn I have ever stayed at - not the usual standard by far. Even the breakfast was disappointing - it tasted great but there wasn't much available and the hot food came out in 10 mins or more apart, so you could have eggs but then no sausages or bacon for ages, and it wasn't…"
4742,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Original room had a leak in the toilet & to not working. Given another room (525) although signs only go to room 524. Room 525 was a store room & made into a room which had a foul smell. Complained again & given yet another room which was extremely small. The tv worked better but not great & bath had hole in it with the bath panel falling off & rotten.
4743,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Greta location and staff. Handy for Tower Bridge and The Shard. Close to underground and also many local bars and restaurants. Hotel is a little bit older in places but did not affect stay. Only issue was unclean pillow cases on spare pillows in wardrobe and took a long while to replace which wasn’t great at end of busy day in London. Breakfast is brilliant though and would recommend.
4744,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"cold, dingy room in basement, close to noisy restaurant, no remote control for TV (despite this being reported and told it would be resolved), and wifi was not worth connecting to. Room and bathroom not particularly clean."
4745,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,We had a long weekend stay and the team were great. The inn was spotless. The bag drop was super helpful as we dropped our bags before exploring then at checkout we were able to leave our bags and head to town before we returned to the airport. The rooms were spacious temp controlled and had very comfortable beds. We would recommend!
4746,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,"Mo, Ian, Yana and Joanna were friendly, efficient and helpful in making our stay a memorable one. Mo was Mr Customer Service, Ian a superb host in the restaurant, Yana highly efficient on reception and Joanna super-friendly in the breakfast room They are a great team and made a positive difference to our stay."
4747,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Woken twice by alarm in service cupboard outside room 301 had to get staff to reset it. Needed to go to reception at 4.00 am and 7.30 am Moved room next day ended up in room overlooking railway with smaller bed.
4748,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,I stayed at Premier Inn in London so I could make funeral arrangements for my Dad. Overall the stay provided much needed Sanctuary for me. The stay was rather expensive and I feel additional meals and drinks could have been provided in the bar.
4749,Premier Inn London City (Tower Hill) hotel,Best Premier Inn so far with great location from theatre and also the Tower of London. Friendly staff and great rooms with twin beds rather than sofa bed. Fresh breakfast made great weekend in London with friends.
4750,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","My husband and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel our room was clean and the bed very comfortable, there was a mix up with our room we had booked but we’re offered complimentary breakfast and drinks for 2 at the bar which was fine, we would stay here again. Special mention to the girl that served us at breakfast(I didn’t catch her name) she was so friendly and welcoming a fab way to start the day and breakfast was fab"
4751,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Very old feeling hotel, great location however and service at breakfast was amazing, i would definitely return, we went for a concert which was only 2 min walk away, super close to the train station also"
4752,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","A very nice hotel. Location I couldn’t be better. Rooms lovely and clean and very comfortable. All the staff are friendly and attentive. The breakfast is awesome. Also the coffee served was good, not the stewed stuff you get in most. Certainly be my first choice when I come back in a couple of months."
4753,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","From the moment I stepped into the hotel I was met by the receptionist with a warm welcome. My stay in the hotel has been so comfortable. The reception staff have been so helpful when I requested a few things. I would like to thank Evie for going above and beyond in the restaurant, Evie is definitely a people’s person who I have had the pleasure in getting to know, I feel Evie is an asset to the company with outstanding customer service. The restaurant staff on duty in the morning for breakfast are so kind, they truly fantastic greeting customers with such beautiful smiles furthermore so helpful. I will be recommending this hotel to my company for future stays. Thank you for making my stay unforgettable."
4754,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",Comfortable and stylish hotel with decent bar / seating area and brilliant friendly and efficient staff. Bathroom and bedroom clean and well planned. Good location in Newcastle city centre. Lots of restaurants nearby if not eating in hotel. For some strange reason the bathroom mirror was only suitable for someone well over 6’ tall ! Not sure what was going on there. Staff at breakfast were super efficient and friendly.
4755,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",We are in the IHG club and have therefore stayed at other Indigo hotels. This was our first visit to Newcastle. We got off to a bad start because when I tried to phone the hotel prior to our arrival I was put into an endless loop which didn't get anywhere. I eventually had to contact Indigo Central who had the same problem getting through. Someone from the hotel did then contact me however and apologised that there were issues with the telephone system. Not a good first impression however. The other issue we had was with the room cards which I had to have re-calibrated a total of five times in the two days we were there. We were eventually told that if we kept them in the same pocket as a mobile phone or in its vicinity this would stop the card working. This is not an issue…
4756,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","I have previously rated Indigo in Newcastle with 5 stars on a number of occasions, and it was both our favoured hotel in Newcastle, one of the best Indigo Hotels nationally and the best of the IHG offerings in the city. However on our latest visit we were disappointed all around. Generally hotel rooms appear not to have been upgraded for some time, and are now looking dated and tatty. No attempt has been made to try and cover this up, or to make your stay bearable with any extras or personalisation. We booked a King rom with a furnished balcony, which claims to be 22 to 24 m2, and comes complete with a stocked mini bar. This description is very misleading: the room is only this size if you include the outside balcony, so in reality it is more accurately 18m2, and therefore…"
4757,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",. The room was small compared to photographs. The wash basin didn’t drain at all meaning we had to wait after each of us washed. The coffee and tea were not re filled after day two - toilet room wasn’t refilled either - we bought our own. Breakfast was the only good thing about the stay.
4758,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Hotel is very tired, bar area chairs are worn and lumpy, and was empty our entire stay. Paid substantially extra for a balcony room, big mistake. The balcony area was tiny, grotty, with a nasty view and zero privacy from adjoining rooms, bedroom itself was very cramped, with holes in the pillowslips! Did not spend any time in this hotel, staff behaved like they really didnt want to be there, we didnt even hang around for the breakfast wed paid for then to top it all we received a £100 parking bill on our return as our parking payment at the hotel had not been processed. One of our worst hotel experiences."
4759,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Visited this hotel with my husband for 2 nights. A bit pricey for the Friday night but I think it was due to Peter Kay being in the city. Lovely hotel, got an early check in when we arrived and were so grateful as we had a 3am departure from home that morning. Receptionist was really welcoming. The room was spacious and very clean, side street view. Didn't eat in the hotel so I can't comment. Location was perfect, near to all shops and restaurants. Would definitely come back again."
4760,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Not worth the expense. In comparison to other Hotel Indigos it overpromises and underdelivers. The balcony rooms have no privacy - I went out on our balcony, turned around to go back in and could see the couple next door..well… Why did they invest the money in expensive glass screens between the balconies and not make them more private? The only shower is an overhead rain shower. Hate having to shower halfway out of the shower as I’m not washing my hair. A shower rail wouldn’t cost much more, but the hotel feels like it is cutting corners. Damaged paintwork, 1 chair for a double room… At the Indigo in Chester, the complimentary mini bar has still and sparkling water, 2 bottles of beer, a G and T, a Diet Coke and an OJ. Here, for the same price, there is water and a Tango.…"
4761,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","1st time here and vert impressed. We had a corner balcony room and it was spacious and well equipped. Spotlessly clean and a very comfortable bed. The breakfast spread was amazing, as well as comprehensive cooked options (I had eggs benedict and the egg was perfect) there was a fantastic choice of baked good, muesli, fruit, cold meats and even smoked salmon. Outstanding."
4762,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",Best hotel we have stayed in in Newcastle. Only one i know which has rooms with a balcony. Food choice at breakfast great. Parking next door £14 for overnight. Near station and concerts at NX And Tyne theatre. All rooms look like they have walk in showers if you have problems clambering into a bath. Highly recommended.
4763,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","We have stayed at this hotel previously. Location is very good, 5 min walk from Central station and excellent location for bars / restaurants. Check in was quick and smooth, was slightly disappointed not to be offered an upgrde due to my IHG platinum staus, however we got a couple free drinks at the hotel bar. The room itself was fine, prob do with a lick of paint but clean enough and was fine for a 1 night stay. Breakfast was very good, plenty of options available and could also order from the menu for the likes of eggs Benedict, poached eggs etc. We prefer to stay at the Maldron hotel which is 5 min walk away from the Hotel Indigo."
4764,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","We have stayed here a few times and never been disappointed. The staff are very welcoming and can’t do enough for you. We arrived early not expecting to check in but we were told our room was ready. We had a room with a balcony,the bed was so comfortable and the shower was amazing. The location is perfect for mooching round the shops, restaurants and bars. It was my partners birthday treat which indigo hotel made it extra special! Thank you, we will defiantly be returning. Regards John Scully"
4765,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","We’ve been staying at the Indigo in Newcastle regularly for years and have always enjoyed our stays. However, in the past few years, since the pandemic started, we’ve noticed a real downturn in the quality of this hotel. The front-of-house staff, I have to say, are always fabulous, I have no complaints there. But the rooms are being left to run down and get shabby, and corners are being cut, presumably to save money, that really affect guest comfort. On our last visit we arrived at 11pm after a very long drive. It was during an extremely cold spell of weather and the temperature outside was about -5. When we opened the door to our room we were hit with an icy blast - the heating was off. I understand in these difficult times for hospitality, it makes sense not to heat rooms not…"
4766,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","I always used to try and stay at the Indigo for work but will give it a miss for a while. The location is perfect for Station, Town, Metro access etc. and all the staff are very good. All of this is still true. The problem is there is currently no Dining/Breakfast room. They are trying to press-on with a sort of market stall arrangement but in the morning I was met with a chaotic situation with people stood everywhere trying to eat, about 7 random chairs for about 30 people and in truth all the continental food tasted rather stale. I took mine back to the room and had to bin quite a bit. I don't think the situation will be a permanent one but I won't be back until it's resolved. Its absolutely not what you pay a breakfast charge for. The rooms are all clean (if a little…"
4767,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Many sites will list this as 4 Star Hotel, it is most definitely NOT. At best it's a 3 Star.The reception staff do what they do efficiently and are friendly enough. Just don't hope they will answer the telephone from your room if they are busy - there's often only one person on duty at the desk. Housekeeping is variable, sometimes spot on but sometimes not up to scratch. The Marco Pierre White restaurant is unrecognisable as an MPW restaurant if you have actually eaten in any of his real restaurants. Prices though do reflect it's a poor imitation, thankfully. It's a great location, minutes from the railway station and the main shopping. The beds are comfortable and the showers are good. Just check the shampoo and soap dispensers have been filled BEFORE you get in the shower!…"
4768,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Hotel staff were great - especially Trina in the breakfast room. Room was basic but good enough (comfy bed and clean) and hotel location is decent. Problem is the breakfast - truly poor quality; - First day ""Full English"" with one over-cooked, skinny, no taste sausage; bacon with soft fat left on (50% of the bacon); black-pudding so hard it would make a decent door-stop; cold beans; served on cold plate >> during the week breakfast has to be cooked to order so why not hot!! - Second day ""Eggs Royale"" (salmon eggs benedict) - un-toasted and un-buttered, stale muffin; virtually no salmon and no taste; lumpy, cold hollandaise sauce obviously from the fridge not made there and then - should be served warm and therefore the poached-egg was also cold inside the sauce >> again had…"
4769,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Booked for my daughters birthday, had booked dinner but when she got there told couldn't have dinner. Asked for refund speak to booking.com booking.com speak to hotel indigo. Backwards and forwards loads of emails and only 50% refund even though they have said they ate wrong. Ruined birthday and taking so much time sorting out. Don't bother plenty of good places to stay in Newcastle"
4770,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","This was a lovely location in Neew Castle, the hotel was ok, quite deated, but still lovely. Staff seemed lovely and atentive. I would return. The night manager was friendly, as was the breakfast staff."
4771,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Excellent location with a car park (huge bonus!) Very comfortable bed and really great shower Great breakfast with THE best breakfast staff-all smiley,attentive,chatty and helpful…huge plus point in the morning. The hotel is beginning to look a bit shabby and could now do with a refurbishment but it is spotlessly clean. It is the second time we have stayed there and would have no hesitation staying again."
4772,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","I was feeling ok about the hotel when l entered. Nice reception, bar, restaurant and smelled lovely, however whilst waiting on lift l spotted how dirty the paintwork was on the door to staircase. That pretty much continued into hallways and room. Room was very dated, slight smell, small and probably the noisiest night lve had in a hotel. Air con/heating sounded like a jet engine. I turned it off so was cold but ended up listening to the next room one anyway…along with their loo flushing, shower on, noisy heels on hard floor and right into early hours 2am. Room service meal was poor value for money…took 45 mins and was Luke warm at best and tiny portion. Was also overcharged even above the £4 tray charge! Shower barely a drip and also warm not hot. Phone In room not connected.…"
4773,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Recently toured Ireland, Scotland and England and this was our favorite hotel. Bright, Clean, modern, fantastic staff, walkable distance from train station , great location in town. Reasonable price. Would definitely stay here again and prompted me to search out Indigo hotels when traveling."
4774,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Kerb appeal it doesn't have much at all, though is ideally placed very close to Newcastle Central station less than a 3 minute walk... bear right out of the front and cross the main road 1st left slightly up hill and you will see the BLUE (indigo) no doubt bits on the outside... Don't be put off... If the staff are anything like the ones I met the first thing they will do is cheer you up!!! Be nice to them though too !... I stayed in room 119 normally I would prefer a higher floor but for one night I didn't mind... The reception area is pretty comfortable if not exactly pretty but is very light and with a bit of a buzz... the bar and restaurant are also at that level and attached... My immediate impression was one of VERY CLEAN and quite well cared for but as with all…"
4775,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Staff: firstly I'd like to start off with the staff and how welcoming and friendly they were. Extremely attentive throughout our stay and were very knowledgeable about the local area when we asked for advice. Rooms: clean but basic. Require a pick of paint and a bit of a refurb in my opinion. The room looked tired and lacked personality for a 4 star hotel. Bed was comfortable. Restaurant: this is where it falls down. I had high expectations of the marco pierre white restaurant. I was bitterly disappointed. We opted for dinner bed and breakfast. The 3 course evening meal most of the menu required supplements which I felt was misleading. The menu was also quite limited. You could have £25 from the main menu rather than the 3 course offered with the stay. However, the menu was…"
4776,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","I've recently stayed at both the Maldron and Indigo in Newcastle and thought it would be good to compare these two 4 star hotels located so close to each other right in the city centre. Style wise I prefer the more scandi style of the Maldron to the Indigo that sometimes tries too hard to be quirky or blingy, plus the Maldron still has that new hotel feel whilst the Indigo must still be newish but in places is already starting to age and be a little rough around the edges. The room in the Maldron was also better as it was more spacious and had carpeted floors compared to smaller one in Indigo with vinyl that are cold to the feet. Staff wise is where Indigo was better with them being friendly and helpful whereas at Maldron they didn't seem very interested. Breakfast was better at…"
4777,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",As a regular IHG guest I know the excellent Hotel Indigo Chester extremely well We upon Newcastle on business I book two rooms at this hotel via the IHG app The positives are the on site parking although there’s a convoluted route back to the hotels reception The interior follows the familiar Indigo design but is a little worn in corners The worst issues were at breakfast we were served curdled milk and upon checkout the IT system was down and despite being promised an emailed receipt three days later I haven’t received it. The hotel in convenient located for central Newcastle If ever in town i would definitely return hopefully this time without curdled milk and with a working IT system
4778,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","First let's start with the positive. It's slap in the middle of the city centre and there's an NCP nearby. That's it. The service is very poor. I had to drag my suitcases from the car to the front of the hotel. The hotel receptionist could see I was moving 1 suitcase at a time but didn't bother to inform me there was a door from the hotel round to the back of the car park. I only found out at the end. As you can see from the attached photos, there is paint in odd places, chipped paint, dirty windows, the list goes on. Shower pressure is extremely poor, I might as well have splashed water from the sink around for all the use it was. They didn't provide a mattress topper for the so-called ""double-bed"" which was 2 singles pushed together. Avoid"
4779,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","The room was very comfortable and clean. The security was a little suspect as anyone could have walked in the hotel and used the stairs r the lift to access each floor (no requirement to use your room key to access these areas). The staff were very friendly and informative. However, we stayed using our IHG Reward points. We have previously stayed at an IHG hotel in Liverpool where our Reward points stay included breakfast. This was not the case at the Newcastle IHG hotel and it appears that the either this hotel charges more than the Liverpool one did or that IHG have devalued its reward points system. If it had not been for that, we would have rated the stay higher."
4780,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",Rooms are very basic but adequate. We dined in the Marco Pierre White restaurant & the food was exceptionally good. The wines are a bit pricy though. We had breakfast included in our stay & the offering was varied & large. All in all a perfectly adequate hotel in a good location.
4781,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",Third visit...everything still as good as the first time. Central location. Convenient for train station or parking under hotel. Terrific service. Staff prepared to go the extra mile.. Not overly expensive for a city centre hotel. We'll be back..
4782,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","No restaurant open but there's a big party in tonight REALLY ?????? Wouldn't stop here again and not even been in our room yet, os train your staff in lying better they re not very good at it , plus £30 for a bottle of wine really ??????????? Good job newcastle has plenty restaurant s to eat"
4783,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Shabby room in need of desperate repair. The walls are marked and stained, but the worst bit was the horrible mouldy patch near the door. The photos say a thousand words. They markets the rooms as either standard or premium. Therefore you would expect the “premium” rooms to have bathrobes, slippers and a coffee machine as in other Indigo hotels but No not here you don’t"
4784,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",Can't praise this hotel enough. The room is stunning and the staff are wonderful. So professional yet friendly and relaxed. The breakfast vouldnt be better Had a wonderful stay. Our daughter is at Northumbria University and this will be our base when we come to visit.
4785,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","I would have gone for 4.5 but no option for that. The hotel itself was lovely. The staff excellent. The breakfast was 1 of the best buffet breakfasts I have had (there have been many) the food was great the staff also couldn't find anything wrong at all. All of the above were 5 out of 5. The only failing for me was no on site parking. But there is a car park to the rear cost of £13.50 per night reduced for the hotel, I believe so very reasonable for the centre of Newcastle but not marked clearly. as a company this should be more easily ensured as it left me unsure if this was the correct hotel car park. my fault to a degree as we didn't use it till after midnight. Other than that small issue everything else was spot on. And my thanks to both the hotel and staff for a lovely stay."
4786,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Wow ! What a fabulous little hotel in the centre of Newcastle ! Real value for money. The staff, food and service I cannot fault ! 5* food at breakfast and dinner. Positives - Food and service. Location brilliant. Downside … expensive at the bar.. £10 for a glass of wine. I had emailed the hotel for a special request but it was never replied to. Had to change my room as it had an awful smell but changed straight away."
4787,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","On arrival, staff very friendly at desk- check in was 1500, we arrived earlier, but were allowed to access our room sooner, which was nice for us after our long train journey. Fantastic central location, literally a 3 minute walk from the station and central city only 5-10 min walk away from hotel. Room was average I would say, very clean, but small bathroom- understand not all hotels have bath facilities available, but this probably would have topped the rating to a 5/5. Fridge ?working - as drinks inside remained tepid even though kept in all through day and night. Overall would come back for central location, but wouldn't pay for king room with balcony again as didnt really feel it was worth the price and I think bed was a double, not a king."
4788,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Visited the hotel with friends and family for a family wedding, from making the original booking with the reservations team, to check in at reception, drinks in the bar and breakfast in the restaurant.... I / we cannot praise the staff enough. The service was second to none and the hotel was spotless, bedrooms to a high standard. Close to everything you need, we will be sure to recommend and return should we be traveling to Newcastle in the future. A great team 👏"
4789,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Booked 5 rooms for a family reunion. Location in Newcastle was perfect. A few minutes walk from the station, bars, shops and restaurants. Despite being a very busy Friday night in the town we all slept well and outside noise was minimal. Rooms were clean and well thought out, some furniture could do with a bit of tlc through everyday wear and tear but nothing major. Breakfast was delicious, good value, hot, plentiful and a good variety of choice. The thing that made this hotel for us was the staff. Everyone was so helpful and friendly and what ever time of day it was we were welcomed with warm smiles."
4790,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Very clean and very central. Yet quiet rooms, Personally, on this occasion, the staff, particularly Nicola went above and beyond. The rooms are well equipped, with fridge etc. Very powerful shower. Highly recommended."
4791,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Ideally located for the city centre. Onsite parking at a reasonable cost. Friendly, helpful staff who were not fazed by anything, they had an answer for everything any guest threw at them from what I saw. Great rooms. A real pleasure to stay here."
4792,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","We stayed here for just one night but wish I had made it two. It doesnt quite make 5 stars but would have liked to given it 4.5. Location - perfect, 3 minute walk from the station and 5 minutes from all the main streets. Quiet at all times, never heard a thing from outside or from other guests. Cleanliness - perfect, I`m in Hotel Management so I`m very nit picking. Even the tops of pictures and light fittings. Well done housekeeping. Breakfast - the best breakfast I`ve had in any Hotel ever. So much choice, I could have stayed a week and not tried everything on offer. Staff - all pleasant, but some friendlier than others. The night guy and the waiting staff were particularly pleasant and helpful. Accomodation - the room while blissfully clean was small and crowded. The…"
4793,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel",Had two nights here at the start of our Hadrian's Wall walking holiday. The room was clean and comfortable. The shower was great. There was lots of choice for breakfast - certainly wouldn't go hungry! The young woman who served us at breakfast was like a ray of sunshine - so friendly and welcoming!
4794,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","We came by train so the location was good and the hotel also benefits from being in a quiet street. The restaurant is branded Marco Pierre White which meant the staff were all well switched on especially Trina. Breakfast was excellent. Our room was spacious, the bed comfortable with a choice of pillows and the shower had different pressures. But, the sink was round and there was no where for the soap, which seemed a silly oversight. Overall, I felt we got a better deal for the price than the other hotels we considered going to."
4795,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Thursday visit, parking at side of hotel with signs, friendly reception let us check in 2 hours early as room was available (407).decent size room, open window, view of top of buildings, fridge with bottled water, biscuits, sachets of hot chocolate, robes, big towels, great shower, shower gel, shampoo and smaller bottles, comfy bed, plenty of pillows, quiet room, great breakfast, if your a fat lad like me you'll enjoy it,wetherspoons and railway station 5 mins away, shops ten mins away, all staff very friendly even the doorman."
4796,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Good for overnight stay, room spacious and all amenities required. Central location, parking onstite, Food was good had both dinner and breakfast. My wife left a dress in the wardrobe only realising when we got home.. Staff member Lauren very helpful located it and sent it via post."
4797,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","I stayed here with my son for 3 nights. The room was okay but the 'city views' are an exaggeration. You get to look at roofs of buildings next door. That's it. Breakfast was average (lovely head of staff, though) and you only get one chance to order any hot food. The main disappointment was with the cleaning staff/room service. There seems to be shortage of shower gel as you get a tiny 30ml bottle per room per day. If the bottle has been opened and half used, it didn't get replaced. Shocking. The same with milk. I felt embarrassed every time I had to ask for shower gel and milk. Also, during the first evening my son spilt some lemonade on the table on the balcony. The sticky patch was still there three days later. I'm deeply disappointed and won't stay here again. AVOID!!"
4798,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Stayed on a Saturday night - actually booked on a “secret” Groupon deal. The lovely girls on reception let us leave our bags as we arrived a few hours before check in. Were allocated room 328. Really comfy bed, almost no light getting through the heavy curtains, and all the amenities that you’d expect. Rainfall shower was fab, decor, furnishings etc. Didn’t get any noise from neighbouring rooms, which is extremely important to me. Breakfast was amazing. Hotel was also very clean and in a great location. Couple of points - couldn’t get a hot shower in the morning, which was disappointing. The mirror in the bathroom was hung a bit too high (I’m 5’5” so not overly short!) Some of the lamp/plug sockets didn’t work. Would 100 % return - thanks! :)"
4799,"Hotel Indigo Newcastle, an IHG Hotel","Arrived at 2.10pm & our room wasn’t ready so decided to have a drink in the bar until the official 3pm check in time. Were allocated a room on the first floor which had a broken bed, torn wallpaper, holes in the curtains and certainly didn’t look the size of the King Premium 32 sq metre room we had booked. My husband went back to reception to complain and we were allocated a corner room (still on the first floor). Same size and in slightly better condition so we unpacked and went out, having already wasted part of our afternoon. Whilst having a drink on the quayside my husband looked at his IHG app and noticed we were in a standard city view room and not the premium one we had booked. As a Platinum Elite member, we have often had an upgrade but never a downgrade!! To make…"
4800,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Stayed at this premier inn as have used before always know what you’re getting no frills was comfortable and in the position we wanted for the theatre and where we wanted to eat also on a bus route very reasonably priced for London
4801,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Premier Inns suit us perfectly and in Knightsbridge it's perfectly situated with lots to see and do locally. There's great transport links too. We've stayed in ""Posh"" hotels but we always feel at home in a Premier Inn."
4802,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,This was as you’d expect from Premier Inn. It’s a great location and good value for money. Only downside was that my room was in the sub -1 floor. It had a window but below street level. Didn’t really matter as not much time spent in the room. Don’t be put off by entrance - it’s in a back street and the upside is it’s very quiet!
4803,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Stayed here for 3 nights this week and couldn't fault it at all. The location is great 5 minutes walk from the railway station and underground. Walking to St Pauls , the Tower, Fleet Street and Covent Garden takes no time at all. A big thumbs up to all the staff who go above and beyond to make you feel welcome, they couldn't do enough for you. I've stayed in 4/5* hotels in London many times but will be going back here as the service was second to none. Thank you to all the lovely staff you are a credit to the Premier Inn"
4804,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Charged for early check in. Had to request room to be cleaned as it wasn't done automatically. Had to ask for shower mat. Felt like the set up was to accommodate the hotel rather than the guest and to save money.
4805,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Enjoyed our 2 night very comfortable stay at premier inn while transiting through London on our international trip. From arrival to departure we were made to feel very special with the very helpful and attentive staff, especially the black scarf girl in hot buffet . Delicious meals right there in house and superb fresh breakfast choices"
4806,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"I stayed here with my 5 year old daughter, the hotel was nice and comfortable, you know what you’re getting with a Premier Inn. The staff however were excellent, they went the extra mile to make my daughter feel special and I’m sure she will remember this lovely experience."
4807,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"The location is great. Hotel was clean and staff were very friendly. Our room was awful though (waste water pipe in the corner (or just outside) was very noisy from 5:45 am, woke us and the kids up. We had no hot water so had to have freezing cold shower. The staff were happy to change our room later that day, but next room also had no hot water (although came back at 9pm). Staff did what they could but 1/3 of the stay was pretty awful."
4808,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Such a shame we had a bad experience as the hotel itself is lovely and clean. Beds comfy. Check in easy. Food lovely. Good location. But they had a faulty fire alarm which went off at 6.50. We got dressed headed down stairs and it stopped. Tried to get back to sleep but it went off another 5 times! Was hoping for a Lay in but didn’t happen on this trip! Such a shame!
4809,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Nice clean room. Power shower and bath. Not really too far from the west end and even walking distance to Liverpool St. Lots of coffee shops nearby if you don't fancy a hotel brekkie. Would stay again.
4810,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Comfortable and good location. Room was comfortable, good size, good bed and pillows. Location is also great. It would have been nice to have a small fridge in the room and a bath. Due to some issues in the hotel, I had to take a cold shower in the morning of our check out."
4811,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Excellent location for train and tube links from Gatwick. Staff are always friendly and efficient. Breakfast plentiful. Room was very clean and comfortable. Very easy to get to Tate Modern and St Pauls.
4812,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,I need an overnight stay before London Ride 100 and having stayed before the location was ideal. Accommodation was excellent to get a good nights sleep for an early start. Biggest benefit for me was being able to take my bike to the room and leaving overnight bag to collect after the ride. Well done Premier Inn 🤩
4813,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"There to celebrate my wife's Birthday and for me to complete the Ride London 100 mile bike ride. Fantastic location, excellent service, lovely modern and clean room, food great what more could you ask for... thank you team 😊. Planning on coming back to stay with our sons."
4814,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Hotel with excellent location giving the possibility for families to stay with children in the same room. Stressless holiday where you can enjoy cooked or continental breakfast, discover main activities, seesightings on foot and relax."
4815,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Arrived at check in to be greeted by Kate who was extremely friendly and welcoming. Checked us in and offered to make us dinner and breakfast reservations and gave us great details for parking. Went to our room which was close to reception so was a great benefit as we had a load of luggage with us and a bike ready for the London Essex bike ride the next day. The room was comfortable and AC a bonus. Had dinner in the restaurant and all three members of staff were very helpful and attentive. Headed out for a walk after dinner which was great as so near and central to so much London has to offer. Would definitely use this Premier Inn again for future London visits.
4816,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Very friendly staff in all departments all willing to look after us. Easy and fast check in with plenty of staff to serve drinks and help with luggage. Very spacious and clean lounge areas. Made the break relaxing.
4817,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Excellent location,great food,clean and tidy, great value for money, lovely family rooms, breakfast great value for money, kids eat free with a paying adult, location brilliant right near the Thames,nice walk to London Bridge, bars, restaurants, London Eye, and all sights to see."
4818,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Spent a couple of nights here for shopping/catching up with friends in London. The evening I arrived must have been after the rush, and I couldn't see many others there for the evening meal. Because of the lack of noise in and outside the room, I assumed there were not many staying. How wrong I was on that one in the morning, trying to get breakfast. Mobbed! So don't expect a quiet breakfast, but definitely up to good premier inn standard, and staff working very hard to meet everyone's expectations. This hotel has brilliant sound insulation, I didn't hear the doors around me banging and superb ceiling insulation meant I couldn't hear the folks above me. Will definitely consider staying here again. Oh, by the way, wi-fi in my room onthe 4th floor was fantastic.…"
4819,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Standard Premier Inn providing comfortable room at a reasonable price. In surprisingly good location with good transport links. Our room was small but had all we needed. Good breakfast and good, but not flashy, restaurant for an evening meal."
4820,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,The hotel is very well located very near St Paul and Covent Garden and very clean. The team in the hotel are very kind and helpful. I spend five days there and I recommend this hotel. The only thing is that the second bed in the room was a sofa bed that was uncomfortable.
4821,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"We absolutely loved this hotel: great service, clean, comfortable, lovely view of the St. Pauls, courteous staff, super convenient location to the tube and Thameslink. Great value for the money indeed. Wifi was the only issue I could complain about."
4822,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"It is a modern hotel, clean, with good breakfast. Very near to Blackfriars and St Paul Tube Station. Good Location. Recepción was sometimes a little bit chaotic or there was nobody at the front desk. Beside this it was fine. ."
4823,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,This premier was in a great location for central London. The check in process was easy and the staff helpful and friendly. The room was clean although missing was shampoo and conditioner. The carpets were a bit dated but clean throughout.The breakfast had plenty choice and was freshly cooked all in all a great stay.
4824,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Awesome location off main road but close to underground. Very quiet hotel with very friendly and helpful staff especially the maintenance guy (sorry I forgot his name) who would always be asking and checking if everything was okay. Great lounge area in main reception to relax with a drink and lovely breakfast to start the day before a busy day of sightseeing around London. Would definitely stay here again.
4825,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"We stay at a lot of Premier Inns across the UK and this has to be one of the best run we’ve ever visited, which is why I’ve taken the time and trouble to write a review. Great central location, very keen, polite, pleasant and attentive staff. Rooms are relatively large for a London hotel and are clean and modern. The only thing that let the place down, and why I never gave it five stars, was the absolute rubbish Wi-Fi connection across the hotel. Whether it was the free version or ultimate, whether it was Samsung or Apple devices, none of them stayed tethered to the network for more than a few seconds. Reception were aware of the problem and tried their best to resolve it but without success, blaming their third party provider for the ongoing issues. But that aside, the place…"
4826,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Booked 2 rooms for a 2 night “explore London” stay! The VERY best thing about this spot was starting the day with a fantastic affordable breakfast to kick off the day. Service was great, rooms were comfortable. Only issue was after a delayed flight, we arrived later than expected to start our exploring. 25 min before check in they said “wait or pay 10 pounds”… NOT “sorry your room isn’t quite ready” - then At 3pm a long line formed for everyone checking in - makes no sense - staff standing around people before 3pm, why not just let people in if rooms are ready? After the line, we were after 3pm before getting room - this policy will likely result in booking other chains in future."
4827,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Stayed for 3 nights over Coronation weekend and would highly recommend. As a single female traveller, I felt very safe and secure. Tube 5 minutes walk and you can be in central London within minutes, if you feel like a walk you can be at Embankment Tube within 15/20 minutes. Room was on first floor, very quiet and slept very well. I did not have any food or drink but it looked very good. Staff were all very friendly and helpful."
4828,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Top class. More than happy with everything. Superb comfort. Very relaxing. Location superb. All seamless. Breakfast was feast. Very quiet location. Room top class. Everything that you needed. Staff super friendly. Will definitely use again.
4829,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"No complaints, nice staff, clean room, excellent locations, good food in the morning, easy check in. This hotel exceeded my expectations and provided a nice and comfortable nights sleep , good aswell that they could store bags."
4830,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Clean, well maintained hotel in easy to get to location. 2 minute walk from Blackfriars station. Stayed on my own and felt very comfortable. Room was spotlessly clean. Staff were friendly and helpful even though hotel was very busy."
4831,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"We were wowed by Premier Inns friendly and accommodating staff. anything we asked for was provided for quickly and with a smile, felt very welcome. Great Breakfast! Great Drink options. Many comfortable places to sit and relax."
4832,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,My husband has stayed at this hotel many times and loved it. It was my first time and I was not disappointed. The location is so convenient to the tube station and the room was clean and perfect for 2 people. I would highly recommend.
4833,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Was staying at this hotel as I was due to be at the Coronation the next day so wanted a reasonably priced hotel in a central location. The hotel fit all of these and has a pleasant stay. The room was clean and comfortable, along with being quiet. It did have a self check-in rather than a desk, so can’t comment on staff so much as didn’t see them as had to leave early the next day."
4834,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Best Premier Inn I have ever stayed in. The room was so nice, spacious, clean and very nicely decorated. The bathroom was great, nice big shower. The bed was so comfy and the pillows were also amazing. It’s in a great location too, not far from the tube and near a Tesco express, Superdrug and cafes. Would 100% stay again, loved it."
4835,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"One of the best stays at a Premier Inn I've had - room was great, nice and roomy, air con excellent and shower great. I would have set this as an 'excellent' stay however the only quibble I have is the view was not great...oh and the toilet roll is a dispenser type not actual roll (that's not very 'premier')."
4836,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"The hotel has a great location, in walking distance of several landmarks, next to public transport stops. The rooms are clean, there are coffee/tea making facilities and the beds are comfortable. The only but important minus - no wifi in our room, very inconvenient if using mobile internet is not an option."
4837,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Unfortunately our room (54) was on the ground floor and the waste pipe/soil pipe for the bathrooms above must be routed through our room. This meant that we could hear faeces falling down the pipe all night. In my opinion the pipe should've been covered with acoustic insulation and then boxed over with acoustic plasterboard to minimize the amount of noise coming from the pipe. It wasn't pleasant to hear faeces landing all night.
4838,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,The room was clean and comfortable but we were surprised and quite inconvenienced because there was no shaver socket in the room. Apparently this facility is not a standard provision in the rooms at Premier Inn and Reception was not able to loan us a 3 pin convertor plug with a 2 pin shaver socket.
4839,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"The Premier Inn was up to its normal standards - room well appointed, clean, bed comfy and breakfast good value for money. What made it stand out from the crowd were the staff. They were, without exception, extremely happy and helpful, it makes such a difference to a stay if the staff are engaged and appear happy in their role. Every member of staff I came across couldn’t have been more helpful and jolly."
4840,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Another great stay at this hotel. Our room was generously sized, with all the usual Premier Inn amenities. Staff are very friendly. Breakfast was busy and the coffee is not great. but staff very helpful and brought us out well cooked poached eggs. This is a good location for the station and Blackfriars pier, but be warned there are very few restaurants open in the evening in the vicinity. We ended up eating at the hotel restaurant one evening and whilst it was good value with the breakfast and dinner deal, the food quality was not brilliant. But there again, it was good that the option existed. This is now our go to London hotel and I’d definitely stay again"
4841,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Great hotel, 2 minute walk to the train station. The room was clean and had secondary glazing so you couldn’t hear any noise from outside. We had the Premier Plus room, the bed was very comfy. Short tube ride to the West End so a good spot to stay if you are going to see a show."
4842,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Friendly staff, good breakfast, clean room. Great to be able to leave luggage before checkin and after checkout. Right near central underground station and bus stops too. Handy to have plug adaptor available in vending machine."
4843,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Great stay as usual for a premier inn however of course this London hotel is nearly triple the price of London others around the uk! Love their beds. Stayed during the weekend and even though the hotel was fully booked no noise complaints. Breakfast good although such a small area considering how big the hotel is, make sure you pre booked. Luggage storage area. Bar staff too slow for a busy Saturday night. Good location, 10 minute walk to st pauls!"
4844,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Perfect for exploring the city. Easily reached via the 63 bus from Kings Cross/St Pancras and close to Blackfriars’s tube station. We stayed on a Thursday night. Check in was easy and our room was clean and comfortable. We had no problems with noise but this could be different at the weekend. This will definitely be our go to hotel for London trips in the future.
4845,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,Great hotel in a quiet location but within walking distance of many major attractions and restaurants. Also very close to Blackfriars tube station. Comfortable room and good value. Would definitely stay again.
4846,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Good food, handy to transport links and for sight seeing. A good location for those doing London Marathon. Booked a Premier Plus room - great to get a fridge and coffee machine in room. Would stay again."
4847,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Great hotel I’ve stayed in many premier inns and this one is lovely great rooms and the breakfast was lovely I’ll definitely be coming back when I’m next in London, also it’s a great location and next to everything I needed"
4848,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Myself and my partner were being intimate when there was a quiet noise that turned out to be a '' knock "" on the door. We then heard the door being opened with a key card from the outside. Of which my reaction was to jump out of the bed and push the door closed to stop anyone from entering. The door was being pushed from the outside of which I said hello can I help you. The door was released and then closed shut. I put clothes on and exited the room and there was a cleaner outside the room I asked if she was the one to open the door and she replied yes, it's on my list of rooms to clean. I explained that checkout was 12 and asked why she tried to enter our room. She said she'd seen people enter the lift and she thought they were from our room so was going to clean it. I said…"
4849,Premier Inn London Blackfriars (Fleet Street) hotel,"Great two night stay here . Very convenient location. Near to tube, train and bus routes. Lots of attractions within easy walking distance. Comfortable and clean rooms. All the staff were exceptional and went over and above to make our stay pleasant. The buffet breakfast is recommended and great value. Don’t miss looking up at the staircase ~ the most beautiful and elegant spiral! ~ Would definitely revisit ~"
4850,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"This hotel is in a perfect location, so close to everything. We were near all the attractions we wanted to see but also able to walk to the shops for some retail therapy!!! The room was lovely, very spacious and a good view. We were also delighted to have a coffee machine in the room. The bed was comfortable and we slept sound every night as there was little to no noise outside. The staff were friendly, approachable and helpful. One of the receptionists helped me to print my boarding pass without hesitation as she saw I was struggling! 🤣 We will 100% be staying in this hotel when we return to Edinburgh."
4851,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,Nice rooms and very comfy beds. Card holder for room keycard kept dropping off but otherwise a very pleasant stay. Would recommend as hotel is central to most things. It is counterproductive to ask someone to put more characters in a review than is necessary!!! This is all I have to say!!
4852,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"I'm trying to figure out any faults I had during my 3-night stay at this centrally located hotel on the Royal Mile and I have none. Sure I wish it were less expensive, but with the location, quality service, excellent rooms and facilities, it's definite value for money. I cannot speak to the food services since I ate on the town for all meals. Would I stay here again, absolutely."
4853,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,A pleasant stay. Good location. Cozy room. Wondeeful surrounding. Front desk staff can use more smiles. I would definitely stay again here and would recommend a bigger variety at the breakfast. Maybe an open buffet breakfast.
4854,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"From start to finish this hotel and it's staff provided an excellent service, everywhere was spotless, covid restrictions where discreetly in place and maintained, the staff where friendly and very knowledgeable. The bar, restaurant and breakfast all offered great quality and value for money. The location could not have been better, right in the middle of the Royal Mile, an idea location to see all on the Royal mile and beyond. Will certainly be looking to get back there again and again."
4855,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Great for everything - location was incredible, service was great, couldn't fault a thing. We used the facilities every day, including breakfast and spa area, and everything about the whole experience was wonderful. Would 100% recommend."
4856,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Stayed here at the end of July and it was amazing! The staff were all very helpful and friendly. Great to have affordable parking in the centre of the city. The room was ideal with the most comfortable bed I have slept in in Scotland, it was massive and so soft. The room had a/c as well which was a blessing during the heatwave, it was easily adjustable, just perfect. The room and beautiful bathroom have everything that you need for a comfortable stay. We were late going down for breakfast the first day (9.30 am) and had a long wait due to COVID restrictions and the number of people that turned up at the same time, this was handled well and the breakfast - we both had the full Scottish was served quickly, we were not made to feel rushed. The next few mornings we went down at…"
4857,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We decided to have a weekend away at the Radisson Blu on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh, on arrival the room was clean and tidy, the bed clean and comfortable although amenities sparse one tea bag (breakfast). We had a good view over the Riyal Mile and despite being at the front of the hotel it was quiet. Breakfast was first Class, albeit COVID precautions have been implemented. I was not recognised as a Radisson Reward member despite showing. My card"
4858,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,Lovely large clean rooms. Really comfortable and great value for money slap bang in the city centre. Staff really helpful. They also have parking available at very competitive rates. We didn't eat there so can't comment on the food. I'd absolutely go back to stay
4859,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Booked a junior suite as wanted a dining table to eat takeaways in due to Covid 19 situation. On arrival greeted warmly and complementary upgrade to the paradise suite. Wow this was fantastic with superb view of Arthur’s seat and the stunning old town. Everywhere was spotless and we felt very safe, disposable cups, glasses, etc. Room serviced on request due to Covid. Staff wearing visors/masks and screens at reception desk. One way system and clear signage informing of the guidelines. Didn’t have breakfast and restaurant and bar closed but was aware of this when booking. Will definitely stay here again when next coming to Edinburgh."
4860,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We booked into this hotel for one night as a stopover in Edinburgh on our way back south. Oh how I wished we could have stayed longer - friendly helpful staff, wonderful room, comfortable bed, superb location ... couldnt ask for more"
4861,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,Came here to escape normal day to day life and not being able to travel very many places out of the country. Booked a premium room with a view of Arthur's table which l didn't get.. See photos. Really was expecting a little bigger room but OK for a few days. Right on the royal mile and a quick 10 min walk to other side of the train tracks for bars and restaurants. Edinburgh Castle is minutes up the road. OK stay but would not come back.
4862,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We decided to have a few days in Edinburgh after overseas options were cancelled. We booked a city view room (room 401) which was lovely but were upgraded to a suite (room 501) after an issue with a light. Both rooms were clean, spacious with beautiful views across the city. The suite was amazing and definitely something we’d book again. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty. Covid precautions were obvious (in a reassuring way) and we felt very safe. We were very pleased with our decision to stay here and want to thank all the staff who looked after us so well."
4863,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"My husband and I came to Edinburgh as a last minute break (holiday abroad cancelled). Have to say we were not disappointed with our choice of hotel! We arrived earlier than check in time and found our room was ready so we were able to leave our bags and go for a walk. The staff here are great, very courteous, and explained everything to with COVID restrictions. Our room was on the 5th floor with a fantastic view of Arthur’s seat and the spires of St Giles, the room itself was very spacious, coffee machine, fridge, iron and ironing board, big walk in shower. Our room was cleaned each day whilst we were out. Breakfast was lovely, full Scottish for husband each day, whilst I had omelette or porridge, there were croissants & small pastries individually wrapped, fruit yoghurt &…"
4864,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Our stay at the Radisson Collection hotel on the Royal Mile,Edinburgh, was fabulous. Under the difficult restrictions during COVID-19, the hotel was immaculate and provided a freshly cooked breakfast, alongside various cold dishes, each individually wrapped to maintain the highest standards of cleanliness. The staff were helpful on arrival, finding a room that would accommodate my daughter, who had not been on the reservation. The rooms were stylish and comfortable. The hotel is perfectly placed for the Castle,the Grassmarket, Museum of Scotland and many other attractions. We were so impressed by the overall experience, we stayed an extra night. Exceptional!"
4865,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"During Covid- we felt the hotel staff members did everything possible to keep the environment as clean as possible. The breakfast staff, the reception staff and the maids were brilliant. It was a fabulous location, everything was walking distance. We booked a room with a view and had a stunning view of the city. You could see St Giles Cathedral, the ocean in the distance and some hills. The bed was a bit uncomfortable as it was two single beds put together so had a dip in the middle, but everything else was fine in the room. All the breakfast options were lovely. The Scottie breakfast was where we tried the best Haggis during our entire trip! We would recommend this hotel. 5/5"
4866,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"I am writing after being totally disappointed with my stay here at Radisson Collection. Let me first start with my reservation which I made on their website as a member, which included breakfast as I had specifically chosen this option when I made the booking. At the time of check in the receptionist could not see that the room was with breakfast but told me she would check this up and clear it with the management. Late last night I once again logged in to my account on your website to re-check the above and could clearly see that with the rate that I will be paying breakfast is included. This morning when we arrived for breakfast the situation was same as the staff on duty could not see our room with breakfast. The second and to me a far more concerning matter is that I feel…"
4867,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,I had an excellent nights stay. The hotel is conveniently situated in the old town. The hotel was very clean and felt very secure during these difficult COVID times. All staff were very friendly and professional. I had most dealings with a lady on reception who checked me in around 2.30 pm on 21/9 and then checked me out on 22/9. This member of staff could not have been more friendly and helpful towards me. The bed was lovely the linen wash good too. It was nice to have good size bathroom with a lovely large walk in shower. This hotel was one of the cleanest I have been in Scotland since the outbreak of COVID. The breakfast selection was not large but it was adequate for me. I would most definitely stay at this hotel again if I was in Edinburgh.
4868,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Booked this for a special occasion. The receptionist was very welcoming and friendly. The hotel is very security conscious and you need your key to access it . We received an upgrade and had a beatuful room overlooking one of the side streets as some rooms do look onto the royal mile. The hotel is in a great location , you can walk to anywhere from it, with the tourist buses stopping just outside. Few minutes away from the Castle and 5 mins to Princess Street. The hotel is very modern. Room is modern and clean. The hotel does seem quiet but due to current conditions , this might be why. Breakfast is a mixture of continental and cooked - full Scottish, vegetarian , eggs, omelettes, pancakes, rolls, fruit, cereals, yogurts and juices, all just what you need to set you up for the…"
4869,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,We booked a room for a night to celebrate our 25th anniversary and when we checked in we discovered we had been upgraded which we really appreciated and it was a fantastic surprise! Thank you very much for this kind gesture. Our room was amazing and we won’t forget our experience.
4870,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Booked this hotel with location in mind and it did not disappoint. It was super clean and very COVID friendly, and the staff were all a pleasure to deal with. Breakfast was good (and the staff were lovely!), although I would have liked to see some more vegan options please. My only disappointment was the room. We had paid extra for a 'superior city view room'. Well take my advice and don't bother paying any extra for an upgrade because all we could see was scaffolding. I probably should have complained at the time but like most travelers we were too busy."
4871,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"lack of atmosphere caused by Covid-19 restrictions meant the hotel was not seen in its best light. a pity because the location is excellent and the potential for a relaxed, comfortable weekend break is definitely there at this property"
4872,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Everything about the hotel was top notch, apart from the transfer of luggage to and from the car. a bit of a nightmare. Would recommend this hotel to anyone except if they were arriving by car. Great situation for bars and restaurants."
4873,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Lovely friendly and helpful staff. Room was great, amazing view of the skyline. Really comfortable beds and bathroom very nice, good shower. It was really quiet when we were there. Absolutely no complaints."
4874,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Our room was amazing! Made this trip for my birthday extra special! The staff can't do enough for you exceptional service and the breakfast was lovely! We will definitely be back, the location of the hotel is perfect location right in the middle of everything on the royal Mile top of the grass Market and a short walk to prince's Street."
4875,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Friendly helpful staff. Room was excellent, great sleep and lovely bathroom. Bed was very comfortable, quality linen. reakfast was very good although would have liked to see a wider selection of cooked items."
4876,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Spent some days in Edinburgh to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and wanted to stay as central as possible. With just a short walk to both castles, everything on the Royal Mile, and just five minutes walk to Princes Street it was just what we had hoped for. Even it being on the Royal Mile it was quiet and relaxing. The hotel is clean, room spacious and the reception staff was very nice. Would definitely recommend this hotel!"
4877,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Lovely /friendly /helpful staff, who were on hand whenever needed ,nothing was too much work for them. The hotel was super clean and we had the most gorgeous view from our bedroom window,simply stunning."
4878,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We paid for an upgrade and was very disappointed with the room. The floors were dusty, walls and furniture scuffed. TV ariel not working. Complained and was offered to be upgraded to another room with a bottle of prosecco. The 2nd room was exactly the same, scuffed walls and furniture, floors exceptionally dusty, seal around the shower door leaking, TV ariel not working - not what you expect for a 5* hotel and oh we didn't receive the bottle of prosecco."
4879,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with friends. Checked in on Tuesday 10th March Check in process fine , but they did ask to take and extra £200 refundable in the case for meals drinks etc. After unpacking we went downstairs to ask where the bar was , as seen on other reviews about a fantastic quirky bar. Reception told us it was closed at the minute and had been moved upstairs for the time being. So off we went , to be confronted to what looked like a deserted empty restaurant ( which it is , breakfast is served here ) no couches, just tables set for breakfast ( very strange ) no ambience, we had 1 drink and left. So after 2 evenings of the hotel bar being closed I asked on the 3rd evening what was going on , and why were we not informed that basically your lounge area…"
4880,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"This used to be a good mid range option, what happened? The food was really poor, breakfast was fine if you had cold buffett. The hot buffed was a disaster with everything being kept in what appeared to be steamers to keep the food moist, steamed black puding anyone..horible...undercooked sausages, what appeared to be boiled mushrooms...I could go on. If you want a hot drink other than a coffee or tea with breakfast, such as a cappuchino or late beware its tastes like someting from a vending machime. Parts of the hotel are not heated or very cold. My room had secondary glazing that was so ineffectual the blind moved when the wind blew. Room cleanliness was poor as was some of the comunal areas, grubby carpets that would benefit from a deep clean. They spray a lot of room…"
4881,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,The location is superb for sightseeing etc. Staff were friendly enough. The room had very little fresh air in it which made it stuffy. Avoid breakfast at all costs especially if your wanting Scottish traditional type. Far better places to each around and also better hotels that give you more VFM
4882,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,Great hotel chic and very classy perfect location on Royal Mile walking distance to everywhere cool in Edinburgh Rooms are spacious and edgy and bar is perfect spot for pre drink cocktail before dinner
4883,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"A very good experience overall, maintenance program in room could do with improvement though. Little things like light bulbs out, sink plugs not working, bedside lights not staying in position need sorting out."
4884,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"A very well situated hotel in the heart of the Royal Mile, amongst restaurants and attractions. It is well appointed and it’s staff are one of its greatest assets being friendly and professional. Highly recommended."
4885,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Lovely smart hotel, clean and spacious. Wonderful room, super comfy King bed. Fantastic views over Royal Mile. Previous reviewers have niggled on the coffee machine (I’m useless on such things but found it easy to work and delicious). There is an idiots guide as well. Secondly, breakfast. It was wonderful, every day, regardless of time/ number of guests. Spoilt for choice and relaxing in a refurbished dining room. In every encounter with staff they could not do enough to be helpful and kind. Fantastic experience from start to finish."
4886,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,Broken furniture and faulty equipment in room. Not very professional waiter at lunch. Comfortable bed and linen and quiet room meant a good nights sleep. Good breakfast and staff generally friendly. Good location but expensive
4887,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Very nice hotel, helpful and courteous staff, comfortable room.Great location in old town just off Royal Mile. Parking not on site but available at a nearby sister hotel. Highly recommended hotel in Edinburgh."
4888,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"My wife and I recently stayed here for a weekend away in Edinburgh. The hotel was everything you expect from a 5*. Nice rooms, very comfortable bed, very quiet at night, luxury towels, dressing robes, slippers etc. The breakfast was delicious with a good selection. The bar looks great also, although we didn’t use it. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It’s very close to the castle, it’s on the royal mile which is lovely, and all of Edinburgh’s best bits including plenty of nice bars and restaurants are all in walking distance. No negative comments at all, we had a lovely time here and would recommend!"
4889,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We were booked into this hotel by my wife's company and it is really nice staff were all very nice .lots of choice for breakfast, one little niggle was the cups in the room were really small to enjoy a nice cuppa after a long journey.The hotel is in a good location though"
4890,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Room was great.Bed very comfy. Really quiet which was what we asked for. Staff on reception very nice and helpful. Breakfast was calm and tea etc. served to your table. Car parking at Raddison Blu, 5 minute walk. Would stay here again"
4891,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Excellent hotel, rooms clean and modern, well stocked with everything you need. Great location on Royal Mile with plenty restaurants and pubs nearby. Efficient and helpful reception. Highly recommend."
4892,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We booked this hotel via booking.com and we had an excellent stay in room 432 during 11-15 Feb 2020. The hotel is situated just outside the Castle and is in a great location for you to get around. The staff were very professional and very welcoming, thank you. It was a shame the restaurant wasn't open due to renovation or we would have eaten there. We would definitely go back."
4893,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"My partner and I stayed in 401 SkyView executive room which had amazing views of the east of the city down the royal mile. Checking in we were given a glass of champagne and some LoveHeart sweeties. The room was very quiet and roomy. The bed was super comfy where we both had solid nights sleep. The staff were relaxed and cheery and helped where they could. The breakfast was varied, fresh and catered for meat eaters and vegans alike. Great location at the top of the mile. We will defo back and thanks to all the staff 👍🏻"
4894,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"5 minutes walk from Waverley Street and the New Town, on the Royal Mile and 5 minutes to the Grassmarket the Hotel is truly central. The staff are very welcoming and attentive, TV wasn’t working and a bottle of wine given as compensation without even asking. Decent breakfast and reasonable sized room. I did have doubts about sound insulation but to be fair we weren’t disturbed. Room pretty clean, only a crisp left by a previous occupant hiding in a corner- happily stay again."
4895,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"We chose to stay at the hotel for the first time as an extra treat to celebrate a birthday. Upon arrival I was told my card payment used at time of booking online a week before was declined, I feel this could have been highlighted before arrival as I did not appreciate being told this in front of other guests, it was embarrassing. Luckily the issue was resolved when I used the chip and pin with the same card but could have been avoided if I had been told beforehand as I would have contacted my bank to let them know to allow the payment. The bathroom was well equipped with plenty of mirrors for getting ready, however one of the lights was out on the mirror behind the sink. The shower in the room was fabulous, it was great to have the option between the two shower heads, so one…"
4896,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,On arrival after speaking to the reception who were so friendly upgraded us to a suite for our stay WOW the suite was gorgeous with views of Edinburgh and Arthur’s seat what a way to wake up in the morning ! The breakfast was extremely good was on the messimine floor due to building work but was still first class service and the breakfast workers were so polite and friendly and very effective in getting us all seated fast with breakfast orders quickly can’t praise them enough will definitely be back and this is my favourite hotel
4897,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,This was my birthday treat. I was 60. I stayed in the skyline room with a view. But the room was disappointing. Had workmen outside . Noise at 7am. Wakened to see them all in front of me. At times the TV was all squares signal terrible.
4898,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"This hotel beautiful inside and out. When we entered we were greeted by the doorman who was very kind and welcoming. We were checked in by Matt, we got to our room and Our rooms tv didn’t work so once reception was contacted within 5 minutes and engineer called Keith came and swapped it immediately and stayed to make sure it worked. This was amazing service and i hope these men get the recognition they deserve. In the morning we were told breakfast is 7-11. We went down at 10am and waited 30-40 minutes for a table. The tables were dirty and no one was clearing them, there were only 2 staff members that I had noticed. They were stressed and understaffed, we waited another 20 minutes to be served and gave up. When asking reception for my money back I was told this was not possible…"
4899,Radisson Collection Hotel Royal Mile Edinburgh,"Rude male staff upon arrival, demanded a £100 security deposit even though there was no mention of this when booking. Looking to make money where they can. Overall stay was a let down as we did not budget for the surprising demands."
4900,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","This is a very pleasant hotel close to station and the gay village. Our room on fifth floor was both functional and comfortable. Very clean with comfy bed , pleasant bathroom. We had breakfast which was excellent with plenty of choice and great value at ten pounds. We found all the staff both friendly and helpful. This is a good choice for a stay over."
4901,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Nice all round hotel in a good location for nightlife and The Palace Theatre. Rooms were as expected for a Holiday Inn. Nicely decorated and clean. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The only issue for me was the parking. The car park the hotel tell you to use wasnt very close to the hotel. Ended up parking in one that was closer. If I ever visit Manchester again I will definitely be staying here.
4902,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Fantastic staff who could not be more helpful. Clean rooms, beautiful breakfast. Would stay there again. Had medical emergency when there and staff could not do more, including checking up on us and support. At breakfast young staff working the breakfast room showed interest in all customers and got to know you, felt like home."
4903,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","The hotel itself is clean and service good, unfortunately it is on the tram line. My room was at the front of the hotel and it literally shook every time a train went past and was very loud. The trains run from about 6am until midnight, so was awoken early each morning of my stay. Unfortunate, but think the hotel should look into ways of sound and vibration proofing. My colleagues in other parts of the hotel didn’t have it so bad, so would suggest moving rooms if in the front"
4904,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",This hotel is perfectly placed for the centre of Manchester for shopping and entertainment. Car parking directly across the road less than 20 metres away. Hotel reception auto checking in or in person. Spotlessly clean public areas room and en-suite. Very comfortable bed and bedding. Plenty of charging points for iPhone and other electrical equipment etc. Good offering of either an English or continental breakfast at reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend this hotel and we will be happy to return when next in Manchester.
4905,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Centrally located, and easy access to local restaurants, bars, stores. Our suite was spacious and clean. Breakfast downstairs was well stocked, and was rather busy. Would recommend to friends and family."
4906,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","What a warm welcome we had at Holiday Inn Manchester City Centre! We chose from the vibrant Hana Dango menu - Asian tapas! Our favourites were the gyoza, squid and bao buns. Thank you very much for looking after us so well! It's the perfect location for a bite to eat after a busy day shopping, or heading out to the theatre. Highly recommended!"
4907,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","From start to finish, a brilliant experience. Front desk check in was quick and easy, choice of room, and an early check in. Front desk staff were so warm and friendly, as were any other staff I encountered. The room was lovely and clean, the bed was fantastic, best nights sleep I’ve had in a hotel for a long time! Great location, will definitely stay here again!"
4908,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","It is not super fancy, but I have never in 50 years of travelling met a kinder and more supportive staff. My friend was very sick, and they were all sweethearts. I wish I could remember their all their names, but Nate, Stephen, and the manager were amazing."
4909,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Room Poor plumbing: blocked sink and toilet that ran water spontaneously Twin room when booked a double Bed was lumpy and uncomfortable and seemed very tired. And as a result so was I Food Really slow service at breakfast - coffee 20 minutes after finished breakfast! Overall Expensive for the quality of the experience
4910,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","We stayed for one night and one day, we had a wonderful nights sleep and it was such a blessing to have the option of pillows. The buffet lunch after our board meeting was exceptional and the staff were very helpful and I sense that they enjoyed working for Holiday Inn. I’ve worked in the hospitality business all my working life and the staff here at the Holiday Inn went over and above."
4911,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","This is our second time at the City Centre Holiday Inn in Manchester, UK. We have had great experiences both times. The hotel is clean, the staff is very helpful, the breakfasts are very fresh and filling, the hotel is centrally located. Very special shout outs to Isaac, one of the managers, and Conor on the front desk. They were very attentive and exactly what you need when you have any questions. I highly recommend this hotel."
4912,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Excellent location and value…make sure to include the breakfast in your stay…nearby to the railway line and trams..staff is super helpful…lots of great restaurants and shops nearby…don’t miss the imperial war museum down near the quay…
4913,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Wonderful welcome by Tanisha on reception. She was very polite, professional, efficient and cheery. My diamond level was acknowledged straight away and was I offered an early check-in with an upgraded room and even a choice of floor. Will keep coming back to this hotel. Room was spotless."
4914,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Fantastic hotel. Lovely clean comfortable room. Comfortable bed too which is important to us. The staff can't do enough for you. Jose on Reception was so welcoming and helpful while Isaac in the restaurant was just wonderful. Helpful and kind. Took the time to talk to us and make sure we had everything we needed. We will be back and soon hopefully.
4915,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","A massive heartfelt thank you to Lianna,(Restaurant Manager) for the exceptional care & consideration shown towards our teenage daughter during her recent visit to the Hotel. We cannot thank this Lady enough for all the kindness and generosity shown during our daughter’s first School trip away since Coeliac diagnosis. Prior to arrival I spoke to Lianna by telephone, in order to query the Hotels Breakfast Menu allergens, & explain the usual concerns regarding allergens/cross contamination etc. Lianna was most helpful, the level of Customer care she went on to deliver was nothing short of exceptional, totally off the scale, like nothing I had experienced before. Not only did she fully take onboard all my concerns, she proactively took charge of the entire situation.…"
4916,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","We really liked staying here. The rooms were clean and with very comfortable beds, the breakfast was amazing and the staff working at breakfast was super friendly. Best hotel we've stayed in in the UK so far."
4917,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Visited in Oct 22 - Clean hotel, friendly reception staff, lively and busy hotel bar though we did find that the security guard was quite intimidating, found this incredibly off putting and unwelcoming to the point that we literally ran past him! We were not impressed that we were stopped at the door and asked to show our key card to get in and that we felt on edge! Good night sleep, great shower. Enjoyed a nice breakfast that finished fairly prompt at 10am. Nice room though noisy with the trams going past until very late at night and commencing again very early in the morning, didn't really expect to hear this, though we have stayed in other city centre hotels and not heard outside noise - It is worth noting that you cannot get on/off the tram outside of the hotel. This hotel…"
4918,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Really enjoyed my stay here all the staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming will definitely be back The parking is convenient across the road and cheap for city centre, centrally located with easy access to all local amenities"
4919,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","If you are thinking of staying here, don't. I just checked out, they have no water, no showered and toilets backed up. They are still serving food and drinks, and no one can wash their hands. I got back at 5pm, left after 10 the next morning, still no water. I accept that facilities failures can occur, but for goodness sake, it's in sanitary and unhealthy. Look out for a spate of food poisoning/COVID, whatever. Close the hotel especially the kitchen, and move the guests. It's not hard to know this."
4920,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Absolutely spotless hotel, friendly helpful staff, the junior suite room was immaculate, spaceless very modern & tastefully decorated, loads of charging plugs, coffee making facilities, 2 flat screen tvs. Very comfy bed and my children were absolutely fine on the sofa bed."
4921,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Lovely hotel, room was lovely and clean. Friends paid for a an anniversary package, was disappointed as they never did anything bar put petals in the room,. this was a massive disappointment as it was a surprise for us. they gave a full refund in the end. only found this out when I got back into work for my friends to ask how everything was. Breakfast was nice. Staff were lovely."
4922,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",We stayed at the Holiday Inn Manchester city center for 4 nights. Arrived at the hotel early. Our room wasn’t ready but they let us leave our bags. Location is so wonderful for walking. Everything is about a five minute walk away and so close to the tram stop at Piccadilly gardens. I had booked a premium accessible king room as we have a 9 month old and I needed the space to fit a crib and stroller. When we went to the room we were given a basic accessible room with a queen bed. I went to reception and they confirmed this was not correct and we were allocated a different room. The new room was accessible and a bit bigger but was still a queen bed. I didn’t have it in me to ask to be moved again and my baby was ready for a nap so just left it. Was a bit disappointing since I…
4923,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Really good stay at a clean hotel so convenient for Piccadilly Station, shopping and gay village. Staff so welcoming and helpful and service with a smile. Room was really nice and good size with a nice view, even if this place is sort of tucked away behind Malmaison and across from Doubletree. I’d pick it over both of these. Bar is ok, decent sandwiches and good during the day. Lacks a bit of atmosphere in the evening as it’s brightly lit and functional rather than somewhere to spend time over drinks.that aside, nothing to say against this place."
4924,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Hotel was near to everything. Quiet hotel. Breakfast had everything. Staff was always very kind. I can honestly recommend this hotel when you visit in Manchester. In the evening, you could buy some food from the menu. Starter a nacho plate and hamburger. Good sizes and the beer was really good."
4925,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","lovely place to stay if away from home working . Itravel all over now with my new job so like a good meal and a nice room and this hotel did not disapoint me at all. Also in a good area for getting out and about as well while in area,"
4926,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","I organised a company event for 60 delegates over two days at the Holiday Inn. I could not recommend the venue enough. The conference facilities are brand new, immaculate and comfortable. The tea and coffee facilities and freshly baked snacks were great and the lunch provided was truly excellent in terms of freshness, variety and taste! The conference rooms themselves are spacious and really smart with easy presentation facilities. It was really amazing value for money and nothing was too much trouble, the hotel rooms were also really comfortable and modern. It's also a perfect location next to Picadilly train station. Special shoutout to Hannah and Anastasia who looked after us and were so welcoming and accommodating to all our last minute requests. My colleagues were so…"
4927,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Stopped in a suite on the 6th floor (611) and was very impressed. The welcome at reception was friendly and helpful and the breakfast was excellent. I was very impressed at the friendliness of the staff. Excellent all round - would highly recommend.
4928,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","We enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn ,Manchester city centre.The staff was very helpful whenever we needed anything, especially Jose Garcia who went the extra mile to make our stay pleasant & enjoyable, his advice helped us so much.Big cheer to the Holiday Inn Manchester city centre,I will recommend them at anytime."
4929,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Went on a work course (we've been several times actually) so didn't stay over and can't comment on rooms, however the food is always fabulous and staff were lovely & helpful. Will definitely come again! 😊"
4930,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Lovely greeting, we were early off the train but they allocated rooms, one super king and one king, hey ho. The hotel is clean, warm, secure, staff on duty. Rooms clean, great bed and pillows. Bathroom spotless. Great breakfast. Just cannot fault this hotel and the price superb. This will be our Manchester hotel stay in the future, great location, we ate on Can Street just across the road."
4931,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Overnight stay for a Manchester Opera House performance with my partner. Flawless check in (slightly early) Comfy room. Excellent breakfast and easy checkout. Extremely convenient for Manchester Piccadilly train station and all the fun of the Gay Village on Canal Street
4932,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Clean, comfortable, sheets changed regularly and towels every day, good housekeeping. Room had both a shower and bath. Nice breakfast which was included in the price we paid. Had a fridge in the room which is a major plus for me. Near to everything. Will use again if in Manchester."
4933,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Good things: room was clean, spacious and comfortable, staff were friendly, late check-out as a platinum IHG member was honoured, breakfast was fantastic. Bad tnings: clearly the hotel is accommodating a lot of long-term visitors on behalf of the UK Government, and the resulting security guards around the lobby and on the lower floors' lift landings created an unpleasant and rather ""edgy"" atmosphere. Having the restaurant divided up with false walls to separate these people from hotel guests was similarly unpleasant, understandable as it may be. It felt awkward, especially in the lifts."
4934,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",The young man who checked us in was totally indifferent and just before giving us our keys he wandered off to deal with someone else without an apology before or after. The location of the hotel is good and the room clean and comfortable. Breakfast was good and servers fine. The restaurant in the evening however has zero atmosphere and the service is awful. The menu is uninspiring and the food just ok.I will give a special mention to Lauren who did her best to compensate for her colleagues and offered a free drink when our order was confused. I was surprised that orders are taken on a pad then have to be entered into the computer behind the bar. Not very 21st century. The handy location means we might return but we would avoid the restaurant.
4935,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","We stay here around this time every year and there are so many positives about the hotel. Location is the main plus as it's a 5min walk to the main train station, a little further to the shops and around 10mins to the Palace Theatre. The check-in staff were excellent and I enjoyed our little chat about theatre. The room was, as usual, very comfortable and clean. Beds comfy, very quiet and a big spacious bathroom (and that's just a standard room). A few improvements that we felt were needed focused on the restaurant and bar only: breakfast was disappointing. I'm afraid I'd have to agree with one of the previous comments about other venues offering better value for money. We do like the convinence of popping down for breakfast and back to the room. On both days, fried eggs had run…"
4936,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",I had a great stay at the hotel. It was only for one night but it was very comfortable & the room service was fantastic! Thanks to Jose at reception the next morning who made my following day off to a great start. Will be back!
4937,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Stayed five nights in early October. My third time staying here in the last few years. Always enjoy my stay. I was placed in room 601, a beautiful corner suite. Great location, close to gay village, Arndale mall, Northern Quarter, etc. Many thanks to the staff for making my stay great. Namely, Lijun and Liana at the restaurant - thank you for the courteous and attentive service; appreciate those early morning Americanos. Thanks to Fina and Rodica for housekeeping service, and quick attention when I requested my pull out couch be made ready for sleeping. Lastly Jack, the handsome front desk manager and the young lady whose name I can't remember. Thanks for letting me stay an extra hour or so for check out. Looking forward to my next stay. Hoping this exact message is shared with…"
4938,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","The moment I walked in I could tell this was a great HI. The surroundings and atmosphere are first class with a really nice relaxing ambience. Check in was very welcoming with the novel addition of a desktop lucky dip for IHG members for which I won 200 points. The room didn’t disappoint either, very contemporary and light and with everything you would expect plus a fridge. The bathroom too was clean and modern with a walk-in shower. Only disappointment here was the individual small plastic body wash and shampoo bottles rather than the more eco friendly dispensers. Another minus point is you can hear the rumbling trams quite clearly up till about 12 am and then again early morning and I assume this is no matter what side facing room you’re in, but as its name suggests this is a…"
4939,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","The accommodation is ver clean, aesthetic and spacious. The rooms are great with good size beds and very comfy pillows! All the employees are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is lovely with lots of options from a full English to fresh fruit and milk options!!"
4940,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","I have stayed at this hotel on 3 separate occasions across multiple days for work and have always been welcomed by friendly faces who go the extra mile. The reception staff are always polite, greet you with a smile, and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are extremely comfortable and always clean and tidy. I had an issue with a leaking iron on my last stay, called reception and a few minutes later housekeeping arrived with a new iron and took the faulty one away. Great speedy service! In addition, the restaurant was always clean, tidy and welcoming. In particular, Mason, who always remembered my face and made an effort to come over and chat with me at dinner. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again."
4941,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",Great for a weekend trip. Well situated to see the sights of Manchester and walkable from the Etihad on match day for City fans. We had a junior suite with a nice separate area for the kiddo to sleep. Clean and comfortable. The staff was great and made it easy to stow our bags minutes after arriving by train at Piccadilly. Piccadilly Gardens metrolink is also a very short walk away.
4942,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years The check in was excellent as a diamond elite member and an upgraded room to a junior suite The hotel is very modern and the rooms spacious with all the facilities you would expect Wi-Fi is free Service in the bar area wasn’t great again and the food order was wrong as always Just seems they employ young staff with little experience Breakfast was Good Hotel is very central
4943,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","A special thanks to Chloe Schofield & her events team. Chloe had patience with my wife and I the whole time of us planning our wedding. Although it was last min planning she done an amazing job. The rooms that we chose to have our ceremony and reception was both spot on. We had an amazing night. Food was spot on. They also catered to some guest that had special dietary needs. We done our own decorating but it blended in nicely with the room. We did have a hiccup however, we spoke to Chloe about it and she said she would have a chat with the team. Overall my wife and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this location. We also HIGHLY RECOMMEND using Chloe Schofield. Let me not forget to mention our 10 rooms that were apart of the package we chose. All our guest were pleased and happy. OUR…"
4944,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","We stayed here as a family going to a gig at the nearby AO Arena. Good location for the arena, not too near, not too far, short cab ride or walkable in about 20mins. We had a suite with a double, and a sofa bed and cot bed behind a partition. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was nice too. Good to have a walk in shower and a bath when you have a family of four staying together. Reception staff were friendly and helpful and from the stay point of view, couldn't fault it. However, we did eat at the hotel for our evening meal. Mostly for ease, as we were heading out to the arena, but it was very clear that neither the waiting staff or the chef was used to producing and serving many evening meals. We were probably the first guests of the evening in a relatively…"
4945,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","We stayed here for three nights and used it as a base for visiting universities in Manchester and other cities in the region. The staff was always friendly and willing to help as needed. Our room was quite spacious for the two of us, and the bed was quite comfortable. The only quirky thing was that the mirror in the bathroom appeared to be installed upside down as the anti-fog section of it was at the very top such that it was way too high to be useful to a person of average height. The breakfast was decent, with plenty of choices. However, if it had not been included with our room reservation, I doubt that we would have opted to eat there as there were lots of coffee shops and cafes nearby for a much lesser cost. We also had room service one evening and the food was okay at…"
4946,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel",A dreadful night’s stay in a gloomily lit and drably decorated room which was plagued with noise from Manchester United fans staying in the property who were celebrating a rare win in recent times. The room was not as clean as it could have been and the bed and pillows were far from comfortable. I found the front desk staff to be disengaged and disinterested when I highlighted my concerns. Breakfast was passable but otherwise I wouldn’t return here. An expensive mistake.
4947,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Lovely hotel and great location, just a short walk away from picadilly train station. Near to all shops in the centre. Rooms were nice and decorated well. Wanted a full breakfast on the morning but at £16.95 per person we decided to walk a few yards to the Wetherspoons and paid less than that for 2 people including drinks. There are a few car parks near by, NCP and picadilly station."
4948,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Lovely hotel, great location and recently refurbished. I was upgraded to a junior suite on arrival which was a fabulous room with a huge amount of space and lovely bathroom. Couldn’t have asked for more and will be back when on business in Manchester"
4949,"Holiday Inn Manchester - City Centre, an IHG Hotel","Stayed for 2 nights over the weekend. ROOM: The room was spotless and really nice. The bed was amazing, it was huge and so comfortable. There was coffee/tea facilities, biscuits and a fridge, though it would have been nice if they would have atleast put a complimentary bottle of water in the fridge. There was a hairdryer, toiletries, towels, ironing board and iron, a safe, wardrobe with hangers, full length mirror, a desk/dressing table and comfy chair, another comfy chair with a table, bedside tables with lamps, a tv with menu and all channels, bathroom was lovely and shower was huge, aircon system in room was really good. LOCATION: The hotel is in a fantastic location, it is literally across the road from Canal Street and five minutes walk from Piccadilly Train Station. …"
4950,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Stayed here whilst visiting family in Scotland, the room was small but well equipped. Fantastic value for money aswell. I also used their parking offer, so was able to park my car in the close by NCP and got it for 50% off! Hotel was located very centrally and a very short walk from George Square"
4951,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Fantastic price for a stay in a city centre hotel. Staff were great. Room had everything you would need for an overnight. Great to see coffee bags being used instead of instant coffee on hospitality tray. Own room temp controls, quiet and very comfortable. We are members so I got complimentary cheese and wine ! More homely, welcoming and better decoration than Trafalgar Square Z Hotel. But then I’m very biased about Glasgow !"
4952,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Excellent location on George Square, steps from Queen St. Station and many attractions. Rooms are small and basic but very clean. A small but inviting bar area serves free wine and cheese in the afternoon. Charlie and Jurgita were very helpful and kind."
4953,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"I love the compact rooms, they aren't for everyone but for a couple on short getaway it's perfect. The staff kept the room so tidy when we nipped out and kept on top of the mugs used and water. A little thing is I wish that in one nook of the room there was even just an extra shelf that would've been perfect to lay out a few of our things as if it had been a longer stay we would've started to run a little short. The bedding is amazing, pillows are very comfy and made us upset to return to our own bed and pillows, truly a comfortable experience. Very few things we didn't like on our stay, one issue we had was the TV does seem to dim as you get toward night time (could be dim all the time don't fully remember) both being night owls and coming back to the hotel at the end of…"
4954,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Myself and my husband have stayed in this hotel every month since our wedding in 2017 and the staff have always been amazing and very accomodating towards us. We usually stay in the Double room however have been upgraded a few times free of charge. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone whether travelling for weeks at a time or even just overnight you'll be looked after 100%
4955,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Well it’s been almost 2 years since I last stayed here but the good news is that it’s still excellent. Situated right next to Queen Street and a short walk to Glasgow Central it perfect for travellers. A few minute s walk to Buchanan Street so great for the shops too! Rooms whilst small are very stylish and come with a massive tv with all the Sky channels, aircon, and a nice selection of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate. But best of all is that their free cheese and wine is back which has been missed! Be warned though, it’s only available for those who book direct and not via sites like booking.com! It worth booking direct as not only do you get that but you get 10% off and complimentary late check out. If I was being a bit of a Karen the only thing I came across was cooking…"
4956,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Location is great. Beds are not comfortable! Been here a few times and the mattress is VERY firm and dipped in middle. Was under the impression time the mattress was due to be renewed but disappointed that I’ve just returned home from another uncomfortable sleep. Rooms could do with a mop of the floors. Staff are friendly and polite. Didn’t catch her name but lady with long blonde hair on reception was lovely.
4957,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"I had a great stay in a lovely hotel. The staff were excellent including Marilyn,Jurgita, Joanne, Charlie and everyone else not mentioned. I would highly recommend this hotel and will be coming back. Thanks all for all you have done to make my break enjoyable"
4958,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Consistently excellent. Third time here and each stay is notable for the outstanding location and value, friendly staff, clean compact rooms, cool vibe and the best perk if you book direct on the Z Hotels website: complimentary cheese and wine! Paul and his evening team deserve a special mention for going the extra mile. It’s very much appreciated."
4959,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"This is my favourite hotel in Glasgow. In the past year I have spent about 20 days in the city, with the majority at this hotel. While the rooms are quite small they are always spotless and very modern. The shower is huge, the water pressure is great, and the beds are the most comfortable that I have slept in. Additionally, the rooms are cleaned and fresh towels are supplied every day. All rooms have aircons and the majority of rooms are noiseless, except for a small number with large older single glazed windows facing the street (although it's just a side street, so not busy). The TV boasts the full Sky package, including movies and sports. Breakfasts are good, but continental, unless you pay extra for something like a bacon or an egg roll and are served up until 11am. I have…"
4960,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Top rating for a beaut place with great staff. Gary is the minister for first impressions. He rocks. I enjoyed the place and the people so much, I’m going back. It’s written that people make Glasgow. It’s true. And the Zed is where it’s at. Get ready Gary, I’m coming back."
4961,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Paul and Carly working on the night shift, absolute legends. Helped me with my booking, I booked the wrong night and they fixed it for me, served me drinks all night until morning, had great banter, were just extremely amazing to be around. I only had cash to pay for the reservation which was accepted by the night manager Paul making sure I had a bed for the night. Best customer service in Glasgow by far."
4962,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"I stayed on my own and was worried about travelling solo but i was checked in by Jade at reception who was so lovely and then looked after by night manager Paul and Carly throughout the night. Honestly a wonderful stay, I will be back. i felt so safe in the hotel especially being a woman staying alone. Thank you so much guys!"
4963,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Stayed for one night in windowless room, by windowless I mean the window didn’t open…the room had a window. Small but very comfortable room. Sky package and en-suite. Aircon in the room negated any issues with heat from the window not opening which was ideal. Well worth the money and very central. Would stay again."
4964,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"I didn't know what quite to expect in a hotel with rooms without windows. If you are claustrophobic it's not for you however I was surprised on how comfy it was, the bed was a good comfortable size and the way they built the ensuite is smart. As it didn't have windows it was obviously a somewhat dark room. It would be big enough for 2 people but there isn't much space so with luggage and such it could turn into a cramped space. It was very clean, the wifi was good and the tv had Sky. It's right in the centre of the city so you can explore easily. They offer breakfast at around £8 I think but I'm happy I didn't pay for this as in the morning when I was leaving I noticed there wasn't much choice. I would probably stay again."
4965,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"The hotel it’s self was ok for a city centre hotel. Great location. Good shower and bed adequate. Although there is building work going on we were not disturbed. Was a great stay until check out. Went to hand the key card in and get the parking ticket validated when the member of staff said he didn’t usually work here and didn’t know how to do it. I asked if the manager was about and he said he didn’t know where they was and thinking about it he doesn’t think they do discounted parking. I explained I have stayed here many times and never had a issue with validating the parking ticket to the discount rate and it also has signs in the Carpark for the hotel. He then told me if that’s the case they would of validated it when I arrived, I tried to explain they couldn’t of because I…"
4966,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Upon first inspection this hotel was a 10 out of 10 for me. It is a beautifully kept, modern and very, very clean hotel with quite small but definitely great value for money rooms. However the mattress used on the bed was a huge letdown for me. It was sooo firm. It felt like I was sleeping on a piece of wood. I was so disappointed by this and would therefore not rebook at this hotel when returning to Glasgow. Please, please, please review your mattresses as l most definitely would have returned if my sleep had not been so disturbed. (We stayed in room 408. Just incase you want to check out the mattress for yourselves.) You do have a lovely hotel with fabulous staff but a good nights sleep is a must!"
4967,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"We stayed in room 222 an inside room no windows and a great sleep was had. The rooms are small but so cosy. The shower room and toilet spotless clean. Staff friendly and helpful,ideal location for city centre or if like us going to gigs in Glasgow. The down side for us was the steep prices for anything from the bar area. 1x g&t and 1x magners cider £12+, and £5+ for a peroni 330ml. Come on guys!!! Great hotel..."
4968,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"This hotel is situated just off George Square, close to bars and restaurants and a pleasant open space. The building itself is a remodelled printing works, lots of exposed brick and glass, being quite well done. A small bar/bistro on the ground floor is good if you don’t want to go anywhere. Staff are quite young but pleasant, and 24hr parking is available less than 5mins away. Drawbacks were that the room was very small. A comfortable double bed with access only on one side, was in the corner. An in-room en-suite may not suite all tastes, though it was spacious and modern. The room was fine for one night for 2 people but would get a bit claustrophobic after that. Ok for a lone traveller though. Allowing for the price booked in advance, good value with no real complaints."
4969,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"I was so impressed by this hotel! Initially I was sceptical as nearby hotels were more expensive, but I was delighted with my stay. It was a perfect central location / base for a couple of days in Glasgow. Right near the central bus station, shops, supermarkets. Modern rooms, reliable free WiFi and fantastic staff. Karolina made me feel so welcome as a solo traveller and was super helpful and accommodating. Once you stay and join the Z ‘club’ you get benefits like 10% off additional and a complimentary glass of wine :) The continental breakfast for £9 was good value."
4970,The Z Hotel Glasgow,I stayed at the Z hotel in Glasgow for six nights. I liked the fact that it is just one minute walk from Glasgow Queen Street railway station as I spend several days travelling to various destinations on day trips by train. It is less than one minute walk to both George Square and the starting point for the open top bus tour of Glasgow. I liked the fact that the hotel has Sky channels most especially Sky Sports though sadly Sheffield United and not Sheffield Wednesday were shown live when I was staying here. The staff were very friendly most especially Charlie who made me feel very welcome when I checked into the hotel.
4971,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Very pleasant stay here at the Z Hotel. Hotel is located 2 minutes walk from Queen Street and is close to everything Glasgow has to offer. Very modern decor inside as well. Rooms are small but it is only a bed for the night and has a very good shower and bathroom so not something worth moaning about. I would have given this a 5 star but there were ongoing building works that I wasn't informed about which took place in the morning. I do think besides this the Z Hotel was perfect and I will definitely return.
4972,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Great location for this hotel in which I stayed for 4 nights. I had a queen room, which is still very small compared to a standard hotel room but this was perfect for me travelling on my own. I asked to be moved rooms after night 1 as there was a building site literally outside my window and the staff obliged by moving me immediately. The air con is great but it's quite loud and tough to sleep even with it off, as there's a constant humming sound. I had to use my ear plugs to block it out. Staff also allowed me to check out at 12 for free on my last day which I was very happy about. Beds were very comfy and would definitely stay here in future."
4973,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"We were in Glasgow for a wedding in early August, and there were a number of our party / couples who all stayed at the Z Hotel. The quality of the accommodation is pretty good for the price, particularly given its location. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the air-con worked well. We didn't expect too much space or glamour for the price. However there were a couple of very basic things that were skimped on, and surely they shouldn't be. For example, this was a Queen Bed room, designed for two people. How many hooks were there in the bathroom? One. Where is the other person supposed to hang their towel? Or the hand towel? We ended up having to drape one of the bath towels over the sliding glass shower door, and carefully hang the other bath towel underneath the hand…"
4974,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"BEST LOCATION. Great price. Love you can get food/drink in lobby. Rooms are tiny but that’s all you need. Clean and comfy. Friendly staff. Location is just steps off square. Restaurants, bus station, train station, shopping, cathedral - all right there."
4975,The Z Hotel Glasgow,I stayed at the hotel Sea in Glasgow. The location is great. Easy walk to the square. The people at the hotel were very kind and nice. The room is very small and is just really a place to sleep. There's no frills. Bed was a little bit hard for me so I was grateful it was only two nights.
4976,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Overall, my mom and I had a pleasant experience with this hotel. Its location is excellent! Really close to George Square and is just a 15-minute bus ride from Glasgow Airport via Glasgow Airport Express. Hotel staff are also commendable because they are nice, kind, and helpful. Hotel cleanliness is excellent too especially the toilet and bathroom! We would definitely stay here again."
4977,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"I've stayed at the Z hotel numerous times and it just never fails! The rooms are well equipped and clean, location could not be better and the staff are just the friendliest, most helpful people! I cannot fault this place. The rooms are not large and that is not what this place is about, it is such a quality place at a superb rate that giving this place anything less than 5 stars would just be unfair. Thank you to the team for another perfect stay!"
4978,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Great price Central location Small rooms Sky TV Bathroom see through doors with no privacy. OK if with partner but maybe not if with friend or someone not so close to but personally not an issue for us as a couple Would return Have stayed twice Staff nice
4979,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Good access from Queen Street station as just along the road. Very quick check in to a comfortable room with all the amenities needed for a short break. Ground floor was quite loud as 002 is right next to the lift so you can hear other guests coming and going - not great at 1.30am. Would stay here again but request to be on a higher /quieter floor and room.
4980,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Charlie and Carly attended amiably to my every need: gin and tonic, ice, a landline, a stool, and even took the phone while I was on hold just so I could step out to use the toilet as I had been on hold changing my flight for over two hours. Come to think of it, it was a third front desk employee whose name escapes me that handled the phone the brief minutes I was away. Clean accommodations and totally accessible to George Square as well as other important Glasgow venues. Thank you so much."
4981,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"We stayed for my boyfriend‘s 25th birthday. The staff were so welcoming and accommodating. We were checked in by a girl called Carly, she was so friendly, such a credit to the hotel! We were welcomed by a lovely box of chocolates and card in the room, such a minor detail but it meant a lot to us! We later on asked for restaurant recommendations and were provided with multiple different types of restaurants and food options! We will definitely be back!!"
4982,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Bernie's lovely, food ain't bad, great vibes. I strongly recommend this place..great yoga retreat unbeliever chai late macha late for a great unwind. I would recvomf if you are into spiritual get aways"
4983,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"We stayed Sunday 26th, it was really busy due to Liam Gallagher gig. Our check in was just over an hour late due to housekeeping staff not showing up for their shift. We complained that it had impacted our dinner reservations as we had to get ready. They offered complimentary drinks throughout our wait and a very reasonable discount on food to tide us over until the gig. I felt bad for the front of house staff, not a lot they could do really. I think a couple of them actually set about cleaning the rooms themselves to ensure we weren't waiting much longer which didn't go unnoticed or unappreciated. Stayed here loads and will come back for our next Glasgow event."
4984,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Great central location near to George Square. 24 hour reception. I had a windowless room and it was very small. Having said that I only stayed a few nights and was out most of the time so less of an issue. Nice that they supplied free large glass water bottle daily. Friendly staff.
4985,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Well located, sparkly clean, pleasant little bar area, friendly helpful staff (one even printed out directions for us to get to the bus station and kept our suitcases in a locked room when we had to checkout some hours before our departure), good shower. But at the time I booked, the only rooms available were small windowless ones. Wow. Barely room to put down a suitcase. I was able to upgrade to a somewhat bigger one, but still one of us had to crawl into the bed pushed against wall and the lack of window made the room fairly dark. Probably not issues for younger travelers, but harder for us. If it would be hard for you, hold out for one of regular rooms!"
4986,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Brilliant hotel and location, the hotel has got everything you need. Staff are really nice and friendly. The black haired polish girl on nightshift reception is lovely too. Thanks a lot for the complimentary beer."
4987,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"a wonderful stay in a totally solid hotel lovely breakfast for a fiver5..all the coffee you want clean sheets, pure water ,,i bought the bottle in fact staff make experiences and this place is a pure undiluted treat.good manners,nothing to much well done see you in a few weeks jude whyte"
4988,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Great service from the staff. From the very beginning they were so helpful and accommodating. I was checked in slightly earlier which was good. Property was very clean-I got a room with no window was ideal for me but quite compact. Nothing to complain about though.
4989,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Booked in for a night and what a great place. Great value for money and perfect location. But what really stands out is the fantastic staff - as soon as you walk in you feel that you are the most important thing to them and you are made to feel special. The staff are totally genuine. This makes all the difference to a single traveller and regardless of the fact that it is great value for money, I would most certainly choose the Z Hotel over many of the other 2, 3 and 4 star hotels I have stayed in."
4990,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"We stayed at Hotel in Glasgow for 2 nights, and it was generally very good. Great location, just around the corner from the Queen Street Rail Station which is almost right on George Square. The On and Off bus route begins right at George Square, so this was very convenient as well. The hotel is also a couple of blocks from the main shopping and restaurant/bar areas on three major pedestrian ways. In other words a superb location. The staff was very friendly and helpful and there is a nice small cafe on the ground floor. Also, due to COVID, Z Hotel moved our reserved room several times over 2 1/2 years as we tried to go for this well planned vacation, which we greatly appreciated. The slightly weird part was the room itself which was so small that the bed was in a corner,…"
4991,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"This hotel is located not far from George Square and is also excellently connected with Queen Street train station and the airport (Bus 500). The check-in also went wonderfully a few hours before, although I had paid 5 pounds per night on top. The room was quite clean at the first glance, unfortunately I found orange stains on my pillows. The lighting concept of my room can definitely be reconsidered. Otherwise, relatively trouble-free stay. Downstairs there is a cafe, where you can linger as usual in a lounge."
4992,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Stayed one night in a double room (no window). Great for the price and location. I was met at reception by some lovely staff (lady with blond hair) who directed me to my ground floor room. My room was compact but had everything I needed in. Full Sky TV, tea and coffee making facilities and a cool shower/toilet glass room! Room had aircon/heater so was able to cool the room to keep me happy! The staff provided me wirh everything I needed from directions to cutlery for my dinner. On checkout I was met again with the receptionist from yesterday who was super friendly again. I will definitely be back. Brilliant accommodation in the centre of Glasgow and just a matter of minute walk from the Theatre Royal. Parking was also easy (and half price) at Montrose Street just round the…"
4993,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Hotel is generally modern and nice. Cleanliness isn’t the upmost priority as we had an cleanliness issue with the first room we was given however this was resolved and we was offered complimentary breakfast. We felt judged by staff due to this also not the best customer service. Me and my partner overheard conversation amongst staff about other staff doing a bad job which isn’t really something that should be discussed near customers.. Also to mention either the staff don’t wear masks at all or don’t wear them properly considering it is still a legal requirement. The hotel was located in a really good location. Pros- Nice shower and modern hotel Tasty breakfast Location is fantastic Cons- Judgy staff Not very clean Masks not worn
4994,The Z Hotel Glasgow,Donald the manager at this hotel went above and beyond to sort the issue where I couldn’t make my stay. Everytime I have stayed at the Z hotel I have been impressed and the work of Donald in this situation has made me confident of booking again.
4995,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"What can i say about Z Hotel in 1 word?.. Paul, absolutely brilliant service and dedication to his craft with a very personal touch, hotel was brilliant and had everything I needed but Paul definitely made the hotel stand above the rest and will definitely come again and recommend to a friend. Thank you for having me!"
4996,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Booked a last minute trip away to Glasgow and booked into z hotel. What a little gem it was! Perfect location near the train station and main square. Super cosy bed. We got a windowless room, did remind me and my partner of when we used to work on cruise ships due to the size... but had everything we needed and even sky TV! The bathroom is a glass box inside the room, might be a bit odd for new couples or groups or friends. Not much privacy in that respect! Would definitely use this hotel chain again!"
4997,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Excellent location and helpful, friendly staff. We arrived on Hogmanay and were greeted with a complimentary glass of wine then a Prosecco when we came back in after bringing in the New Year in George Square. Hotel is a stones throw from the Square and 2 minutes walk from Queen Street Station. Rooms are compact but have everything you need, well apart from a fridge. There is complimentary water, tea/coffee and toiletries. Bed and room very clean. Only improvement in cleanliness would be the black discolouration of sealant in the shower cubicle, which is easily removed with products that cost less than £10. Didn’t put us off though as would definitely stay here again."
4998,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Amazing hotel, clean and comfortable and very friendly staff. Visited with friends for new year and a great place to stay centrally in Glasgow! Breakfast was fantastic too and all at very competitive prices! Thanks to all the staff for an amazing stay! Xx"
4999,The Z Hotel Glasgow,"Just home from a very enjoyable stay in the z hotel. Nice clean rooms which are minimalistic but had everything we needed (although we just asked for fresh towels etc as required). Only downside of room was that the bed was right up to the windowsill which makes it tricky to get in and out of bed if there is another person in it!! A smaller unit at other side would possibly allow enough of a gap for ease of getting in/out of bed. That said, it was nice to have drinking water in room as well as usual tea/coffee etc. Also a nice touch to have sky sports and movies channels. We were also offered complimentary wine on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day which was appreciated. Staff are helpful and friendly. We had breakfast one morning which was basic but tasty and only £5 per person.…"
5000,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Super hotel. Modern, clean, comfortable. A stones throw from Old Trafford, busy on match days but so convenient. Secure parking is just across the road. Every member of staff we encountered/spoke to was friendly and helpful. Although busy the staff were so efficient it didn’t feel like it was. The breakfast was perfect. Delicious and freshly cooked not like the buffet-style cooked food that is left to congeal for hours. We will definitely stay again. Thank you for a great time."
5001,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Couldn’t fault it, booked this for my partners birthday for a football themed bank holiday weekend, the rooms were lovely, spacious and of course very clean and maintained and the few staff we met seemed lovely. Nice easy check in when we arrived and we went for dinner in cafe football, the service was very quick and the food came out very hot and tasty so again can’t fault it. I booked a standard double room but asked if it was possible to be overlooking the stadium as we’re celebrating a birthday… the view was amazing from our room so thankyou for that! Would definitely recommend! :)"
5002,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"What a nice hotel! Great room, nice extra touches that make you feel the guest’s experience have really been thought of. Staff were really helpful and welcoming. Will definitely return. Even the view of Old Trafford didn’t put me off 😂😂 Thank you!"
5003,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Beautiful view of the famous Old Trafford! Very big room with comfy bed and pillows. Breakfast was very good. Has an amazing football pitch at the top overlooking Old Trafford. Clean bathroom and room. We loved it!
5004,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"An absolutely superb and warm welcome from Lauren at reception on arrival, along with her brilliant colleague Chanel. We were so impressed by the very friendly, smiley and efficient check in, with all of the information we needed to know. I'm sure they've said the information a million times before, but they were so friendly and personal, it was the best welcome to a hotel we have ever received (and we stay in so many for work!). Nothing was a problem, and any questions we had were answered really quickly - and helpfully. A brilliant stay at a brilliant hotel - but namely due to the brilliant staff that set the tone when you arrive, so you know you're in good hands! Thank you Lauren and Chanel! P.S. The Instagram like counter at reception was brilliant!"
5005,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Stayed at hotel football for the Manchester Marathon. Couldn’t rate it high enough! Brilliant location for the start. Special mention for Chanel and Georgia at reception who were so professional, helpful and accommodating. The management are lucky to have such excellent staff."
5006,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"My first stay here - attending a conference/workshop - arrived early evening for a meeting then dinner with talk followed by an all day workshop the next day. Great location. - my room overlooked the Manchester United sign - lit up at night - others overlooked the pitch - as it had been a block booking had no influence on this and was happy with room - which was appointed like many continental motel offerings - think MotelOne, Ibis Styles - i.e. walk in shower, functional bathroom - more male influenced I think - and modern room approach. Meeting rooms were good and evening dinner and breakfast more than adequate. Service was good at mealtimes and on reception on arrival and check out. Found the odd layout a bit strange between the players lounge and the other rooms we used…"
5007,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Just had a brilliant stay at Hotel football The staff are so friendly and helpful The hotel itself is perfect. My 12 year old son loved it. The little touches make all the difference. Like the treats in the mini bar , the football pitch on the roof and the great food. We had a room on the 2nd floor, I didn’t think we would have a great view , but the way the hotel is designed I was proven wrong, had a great view of the stadium. The room itself was very modern and clean. Really can’t wait to visit again. Great Staff Great hotel"
5008,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"This is the 3rd time we have stayed at the hotel-it just gets better! The staff are always friendly and helpful. We stayed in the family room on the 7th floor, what a view. My son loves this hotel and enjoys the treats in the mini fridge. The beds are amazing amazing and the bathroom is one of the best I’ve stayed in. Shower is great and so is the bath. Keep up the great work can’t wait to return. Food also good in the restaurant."
5009,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Hotel was very clean, ideal location and staff very friendly and helpful. Hotel car park was only a few minutes walk from hotel and very reasonably priced. Cafe Football was located in same site as Hotel, only seconds from Hotel reception through internal door, which was ideal. Additional tea & coffee & milk in room would have been better. Only enough for one tea and coffee each. Although I presume I could have asked reception for more. Also, no biscuits provided on tea/coffee tray in room. Complementary items in room fridge were poor. Very few and more suited for children rather than adults. Cost of hotel was significantly higher than similar hotels, so somewhat disappointed. Then on top of that, Breakfast was at additional cost (£15 per person)."
5010,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"CLUB FOOTBALL restaurant. We had a great meal here once again. The staff and service here are excellent. Always friendly, helpful and offering good advice on the menu choices, whether it’s food , beer or wine. Very prompt service. Great place to come before heading to the great stadium!"
5011,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Very helpful staff which ensured that my visit to the hotel was first class. After hearing that it was my first visit they put me on the top floor to ensure I got the best experience. Car parking was very close and not a dogfight as I had expected on match day Lauren and Hamella were excellent
5012,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Bookd a night stay at Hotel Football and what a fabulous stay it was, hotel was beautiful and very clean and both meals we had were excellent. We stayed in a stadium view room which was marvellous, view were fantastic a must for any Man Utd fan, room was spotlessly clean, I highly recommend this hotel"
5013,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Hotel Football. We had won a giveaway titled ""Win Matchday Hospitality for 2 people for the MUFC v Crystal Palace game on the 4th Feb"" and had even booked and paid for a non-refundable hotel to stay in for the trip. However, Hotel Football suddenly withdrew the prize, without providing us with any explanation or compensation. We lost £220 on the hotel booking and were extremely upset. To make matters worse, when we tried to reach out to the management (Jessica Southworth) to express our unhappiness, she was very rude and unhelpful. Even the owners (Gary Neville) were no help; they completely ignored us and the issue that they had caused. Hotel Football's terrible customer service and lack of communication has really put me off…"
5014,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"The location is unbeatable if younare planning a short stay to watch a football match at Old Trafford. There is a very lively atmosphere at the hotel pub at ground floor pre and post match. The rooftop pub is incredible, if you can get in as it is usually very crowded on match days. The breakfast is very good. Do try the three egg omelette."
5015,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Me and my boy arrived at Hotel Football on Thursday 23rd Feb for 1 night stay. We were down for the Man U v Barca game. Can’t thank the staff enough as nothing was too much trouble. Made my 9 year old feel amazing. A special mention to Hermela who went above and beyond for both of us. Overall a fabulous experience and well worth a visit and enjoy the vibe in the hotel. Mark & Alfie
5016,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Popped in here for the build to the barca game and popped in again the following day so the Friday , blond manager girl who runs the food is rude , clearly doesn't like her job , not approachable and needs training on people managment and the girl working behind the bar clearly doesn't like doing Abit of work , two of the rudiest people I've came across, they should be leading by example to the younger employees who were infact lovely and polite ."
5017,Hotel Football Old Trafford,What a great hotel for any football fan not just Manchester United fans. Although situated over looking Manchester United the hotel themes is around premier league and it is a great experience. The views from the top floor indoor football pitch is a must see. Rooms very clean and modern and spacious with everything you could need including sky sports and bt sports on the tv. Free minibar with snacks and soft drinks was also a lovely bonus. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again - I am not a Manchester United fan but we had a view overlooking the stadium which was great - I would say if you are a Manchester United fan the extra upgrade for a stadium view is a must!
5018,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"The hotel location was amazing. We flew from Ireland to do the old Trafford tour. We had an amazing view of the stadium from our room. The soccer pitch on the roof top was a big hit with the kids. The staff were so friendly and chatty, gave us great advise on the local tram, shopping centres and local area. Would highly recommend this hotel and will be back again."
5019,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Went up for United v city and stayed in a stadium view room Which was brilliant.. we eat both breakfast and dinner and I must say the service was the best I’ve ever had names of the staff where Ellen and Owen never had customer service like it … normally stay at budget hotels but will always stay hear from now on when I come up for games really welcoming and friendly atmosphere
5020,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Stayed for Manchester United's FA cup game with reading and the staff were as friendly and helpful as you could of wished for (especially Claire and Adrian). Location of the hotel is extraordinary, just a short walk to old Trafford and neighbouring shops. The rooms are extremely clean. Will definitely be visiting again in the near future."
5021,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"I booked this hotel on a recent trip to Manchester. The hotel is right in front of the Man United stadium which is a plus but the hotel itself is the negative. The lobby is very small & uninviting. The rooms are very small and very basic. Nothing to write home about. The halls were being cleaned and you can tell has a lot of wear and tear. There was a Man U & Man City game going on same day; therefore the relatively small hotel was packed & oozing with people in & out with alot of noise. I could not stay @ the hotel and checked out immediately. Well, I was in the process of checking in when I asked to view the rooms. I knew I cldnt stay @ the hotel. The manager tried to give me a hard time stating they will charge me for the first night. After much back & forth, she said they…"
5022,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Family trip to celebrate my daughters birthday and watch man united women play. Hotel rooms were pretty basic and one of the rooms had a really damp smell. Very good shower was a plus. The restaurant is best avoided. We were given dirty menus, they were paper so I’d guess pretty easy to replace. Placed a drinks order and asked for a glass of water to go with my cocktail, it never arrived. Asked for ketchup and vinegar, they never arrived so asked again after 5 minutes. The ketchup was in a glass dish and tasted awful, like plastic. And then we were told they would have to look for vinegar, then we’re told they didn’t have any! I had the nachos which looked amazing but were pretty tasteless. Breakfast the next day was ok but there was no white bread and none of the advertised…"
5023,Hotel Football Old Trafford,We travelled from Australia to celebrate our son’s 13th birthday. As a avid Man U fan we decided to stay 2 nights and watch a game at Old Trafford. It was an absolutely unforgettable experience made even better by Chris Hull and Chanel. The rooms overlooking Old Trafford were sensational. They were spacious and comfortable but the highlight was definitely the football pitch on the roof. Upon hearing it was our son’s birthday they really made sure it was a birthday he’ll never forget. The proximity to Old Trafford was brilliant and the hotel had great security on match day. It was also surprisingly quiet on match day despite the huge crowds entering Old Trafford. Could not recommend high enough. The staff really go out of their way to ensure you have the best experience.
5024,Hotel Football Old Trafford,I booked this hotel for my son and his girlfriend over New Year as a gift. As my son is a Man United fan it was ideal. They absolutely loved it. They didn’t dine in in the evening. The only issue was when they checked in they were told that breakfast was until 11am. They were staying 2 nights. I had paid for a full hot breakfast for bath nights. On the second night they entered the dining room at 1030am only to be told that breakfast finished at 10am and the kitchen had wiped down so they would need to have only the offerings left on the continental. So they went hungry. Other than this issue I would recommend this hotel if you are a Man Utd fan. The views from the room were amazing.
5025,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Stayed for the Manchester Derby. The staff are all very friendly and helpful! The location is perfect being next door to Iconic Old Trafford. The rooms are clean and have ample space for 2 people. They are well stocked with drinks and treats. The cafe & bar have good selection of foods and great place to meet fellow United fans. We stayed for my son's 18th birthday and would definitely stay there again.
5026,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"You just cannot beat this location for football fans! It is steps away from the stadium and you will realize the value when the match gets over and find people struggling to reach their destination while we just strolled back into our room. The hotel is very basic so please do not expect concierge services, bell desk, executive lounges, etc. The staff are simply awesome and how I wish I had written down the names. As a Titanium member, I was upgraded to a stadium-view room and my son was just glued to the chair and could not stop looking outside. The rooms are very small sized and the minibar is free. The toilet is also small but a useful feature is the heated railings for drying up your towels and clothes. I did not dine there so I cannot give any review on the food.…"
5027,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Just back from what was honestly one of the best family trips we’ve ever had and it was mostly because of the hotel. From the moment we got to the rooms- amazing view over Old Trafford and the memorabilia in the room, it was just top class. The bed was one of the most comfortable we’ve ever had in a hotel. The complimentary mini bar full of retro sweets was a huge hit with the kids. As was the sweet shop for dessert in cafe football. There was a great buzz around the hotel before and after the game and we soaked it all up in Cafe Football. The biggest excitement was for the astro in Heaven, top floor- the kids spent as much time as they could up playing with the other kids staying in the hotel, such a great facility to have for kids. Breakfast was great, super choice…"
5028,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Stayed three nights in a second floor room with great view of the Old Trafford stadium. Helpful and friendly reception staff. Rooms not overly spacious but very clean, comfortable and quiet with coffee/tea making facilities and mini bar fridge with free kids treats. Nice modern bathroom with large shower and nice large towels. Hotel is only a few metres from the Wharfside metro link stop and the metro link has a stop at Manchester airport. Thus you can save a bit by taking the metrolink from and to the airport via the Deansgate metrolink stop. We had dinner in the Resteraunt on a couple of occasions and ate breakfast in the restaurant each day. Menu choice and food okay but not great but service was good even during busy times and it’s advisable to book. The Trafford Centre…"
5029,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"The staff at this hotel are outstanding, nothing was too much to ask they went above and beyond. The hotel itself was fantastic the rooms were very comfortable and decorated with lots of memorabilia and made a special stay extra special. Special thanks to Johanna and Ellen who were amazing!!!!"
5030,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Our second visit to Hotel Football, we first visited as a family when my son was just about 4, now he’s 11 and Football Crazy! I don’t often book a hotel out of town but as this was a Christmas present for my son I had his interests to consider before my own!! He loved being so close to Old Trafford and a highlight for him was having a kick about on the rooftop football pitch which is free to use if they don’t have pre booked events. (Take your own football). We booked a standard room. The room was spotless, we had a great view of the stadium (Room 319) and we both throughly enjoyed the fridge treats. My son loved having access to all the sports channels on TV. We ate an early pre theatre dinner in Cafe Football. The menu doesn’t appear to have changed since our last visit.…"
5031,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Excellent hotel, clean, spacious room, comfy beds, great amenities (and fridge treats!). The biggest credit to the hotel is the staff, each person we met was friendly, happy and nothing was too much trouble. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
5032,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Hotel football what can I say , I have stayed here about 8 times and even though they have all been amazing this has topped them all , in the years gone by from meeting gary Neville to Norman whiteside this time has been the best ,the staff from Arren the bar manager to Chanel Elise goy at the reception they made my son flynn’s first Man Utd match one of the best days and hotels stays of his life thank yous all so much ,hotel football and all the staff , we can’t wait to get back and highly recommend it to everyone and anyone"
5033,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Absolutely amazing service again. From the moment we walked in we was welcomed with a smile. Had a lovely drink in the bar area whilst we waited for our room to be ready as we was very early. I paid for the birthday package and it was just phenomenal!! Breakfast was out of this world again. Thankyou to all of the staff at hotel football. Yet another amazing stay with you again.
5034,Hotel Football Old Trafford,I am at a loss of words to how amazing this hotel and the customer service were. Absolutely everything was no problem and we were made to feel so comfortable ……… if you have never been please do so you won’t regret it.
5035,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"The hotel was great, with the added surprise of the roof top pitch for kids. We were there each side of match day, and my son disappeared up stairs where there were always kids around to play with. The desk staff were super friendly and helpful, making a fuss of my son whenever we passed through. Restaurant staff weren’t as happy, well a few of them at least. Food was okay, not the worst, but for a family friendly restaurant it was above expectations. Filling the fridge each day with candy and pop was a bonus my son loved. Being around the hotel to watch the build up and buzz for the game was amazing. Only one annoying thing, eating lunch when a kids party started with lots of screaming was the best idea, should have a separate area for the parties or warn the other…"
5036,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Just want say thank you for the amazing stay all staff amazing food was 10 out 10 service 10 out of 10 breakfast was 10 out 10 thank you too you all hope you have a lovely Christmas and happy new year amazing hotel hope you all get some rest over Christmas xx
5037,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"As a wheelchair user staying in a hotel you have never visited before can be a daunting experience. My wife and I have wanted to stay at Hotel Football for a long time but it sells out quick on match days so our recent visit gave us the perfect opportunity to do this. As soon as we arrived in reception we were greeted with a very warm welcome by the staff. Chanel and Lauren really helped make our stay special, they took a genuine interest in us as guests and made sure we had everything we needed as well as explaining a few things. As a wheelchair user I can gauge a hotels care for its disabled guests by whether it does a PEEP when I check in or not. A PEEP was indeed done and the two ladies took their time to help with it to make sure we would get the help we needed in an…"
5038,Hotel Football Old Trafford,Suudhdhrjdjhdhehdhdjdjjrjfjfjfjrjh it’s a bit euuririryeuuuuru but it looks way more realistic and it makes sense that it was the same person in a similar situation and they are still in a similar position and it was the right thing for him and he did not want it but it is a very bad situation so it is not the same person who was the one anyway goodbye bye see you later bye love you bye see you tomorrow night and thank you for being there with us bye
5039,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Bedroom fab, shower was one of the best I've used, bar and staff in bar were great and very friendly. However we had booked full breakfast. We went down about 8.30am, there was about 10 people in restaurant, not exactly full. We were shown to our table by one of the staff in the blue football shirts and given a menu to chose from. We had literally just sat down with our cereal and was asked what did we want for breakfast. We weren't given any time to look at the menu. The English breakfast was put down to us before we had even finished our bowl of cereal. (Breakfast was lovely and hot). The whole thing felt rushed. This has really disappointed us after the initial good experience. The girl in the cafe who took our order and gave us our breakfast never smiled once. She…"
5040,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Shocked this hotel has a 4.5 star aggregate as the noise complaints in previous reviews are plentiful and the hotel hasn’t seemed to have made any sweeping attempts to change what’s causing it. The rooftop music bangs on into the morning. We’re currently on floor 6, 2 floors down from the clubbing rooftop, and it’s awful bass and booming music emanating. Other reviews stated they can hear it from floor 3. If that’s the case, changes should be implemented. Crazy a hotel would operate like this, allowing excessive noise and booming bass for their hotel guests trying to sleep, Until 12am/1am. Called the front desk to complain. Was told the music will go til 12:30am. Was told they’d try to tell the dj to turn down the bass. It’s 30 minutes later and we have not noticed any change."
5041,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Just got back to Cornwall from a 3 night stay at Hotel Football and I don't usually bother to leave reviews but the staff here absolutely deserve a fabulous review, outstanding service, they went over and above for my sons birthday, were all really polite and lovely and I can't wait to stay here again. The food was all delicious and reasonably priced as well which was a bonus! Would highly recommend"
5042,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Hate United, don’t like Gary Neville 😃 but what a brilliant Hotel. Great service, excellent bed, big clean room and a lovely breakfast - for a £100 👏👏. The staff were friendly and really efficient. I’ve stayed at hotels that were 3 times the price and they wouldn’t come close to the standard at HF"
5043,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"One of the nicest places I’ve ever stayed. The hotel itself is right opposite Old Trafford so fantastic to be able to look out and see it so close, the location is also excellent for transport links. Although the car park is just opposite it is very secure and we had no problem parking. The hotel itself has a great overall standard, the decor is nicely themed - and brilliant wallpaper! The room was huge with a big bathroom, great shower and toiletries. There was a mini fridge with complimentary drinks and snacks and a great view from the window over the city. The bed was incredible, absolutely huge and so comfortable. Great nights sleep after us leaving another hotel feeling crippled from the total opposite! We timed our arrival well getting to watch a MUFC match on in the…"
5044,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Had some amazing stays at hotels, then had some nice stays, sadly this visit fell WAY below standard. Attended here for a conference at Manchester United Stadium however this hotel really is about nothing but making money. Whoever finances this hotel needs to be ashamed with themselves and hang their heads in shame with the total cattle market that this hotel is. Don’t get me wrong, I do not blame the probably minimum wage staff I met on the day who tried their best, but being laughed at due to the distance I had to walk from the disabled parking to the hotel, is a joke. THERE IS NO PARKING AT THE HOTEL. However there is a hotel car park across a duel carriageway which is dimly light to say the least. Then attended the rooftop bar which had such minimal seating, I had to sit on…"
5045,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Attended a lunch pre-game (Rugby World Cup) in the Stadium function room and found the staff service first rate, very helpful. Food was served piping hot, though menu was a bit poor. All facilities were excellent, made for a great visit. Would recommend, not only it’s proximity to the stadium."
5046,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Stayed here for 1 night for a special occasion and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was very clean and the staff kind and welcoming. Upgraded to a stadium view and it was worth every penny. Also added on the celebration package which was definitely worth doing to add that extra bit of celebration. Hotel is in a great location, you can walk over to Media City. Had breakfast in the morning which was fine but nothing special. I would definitely stay again."
5047,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Rooms are great , Shame about Account Department NOT Putting CREDIT BACK ONTO CREDIT CARD , We didn't use all our credit ,STILL WAITING 3 WEEKS LATER !!!!!!, DO NOT DO IT!!! Pay for your drinks and food as you go , HOTEL, great rooms large shower"
5048,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"Returned today for some match day hospitality, always the best place to go before a game. Well organised and well executed by all of the staff involved. Brilliant atmosphere and best views you could imagine. Looking forward to my next visit already."
5049,Hotel Football Old Trafford,"REMEMBER THE NAME 'HOTEL FOOTBALL' setting the standards for every hotel to aspire to. Easily the best hotel I've ever stayed at. This was my second time staying at Hotel Football, Manchester. And this time was better than the first. Experiencing the match day hospitality package is a must here for any football fan, it's unbelievable and guests are treated like royalty. After a terrible start to the day, travelling from Northern Ireland and having multiple delays to our flight, it was a breath of fresh air stepping foot inside hotel football, and from the first second it was amazing. The girl that checked us in was fantastic, I wish I knew her name to give her praise as she is a credit to the hotel. The hotel itself has a very welcoming atmosphere. The staff throughout the…"
5050,The Royal Hotel,A classic and historic hotel which provides exemplorary service to guests. I was born in Ventnor and for a number of years the family home was immediately behind the hotel so it seemed the natural choice to make for accommodation when - during visits to the UK - I travel to the island to catch up with relatives and school friends who still live there. This was not my first visit to the Royal and I have yet to be disappointed
5051,The Royal Hotel,"Visited The Royal Hotel on Saturday evening of the last May bank holiday of 2023, the service in the bar was exceptional from Jade and Michael who were very professional on a very busy evening. Myself and my partner can not praise them enough. It made are evening very enjoyable and will definitely be returning again."
5052,The Royal Hotel,"On Tuesday 30th May at 3pm we were booked for tea at The Royal. We are avid, high end travellers so know what to expect in terms of service & standards. The Royal didn’t let us down. The people who are submitting lower scores on Tripadvisor, need to learn to manage their expectations, talk to staff, build relations and collaborate to make your experience memorable. Although we were fifteen minutes early, we were promptly seated and were quickly joined by the happy, smiling and confident Mervin. Our dietary requirements were perfectly met as we had advised the hotel at point of booking. Tea is served in the main foyer overlooking the front gardens so you have to accept other guests walking around going to the beach, checking in etc. The food was of very good quality but…"
5053,The Royal Hotel,"Having had dinner with you on two occasions seven years ago, we were keen to repeat the exceptional experience as residents for two nights. We would unreservedly recommend the Hotel to others seeking relaxation, service and a 'classical' environment."
5054,The Royal Hotel,"Great helpful reception staff, comfortable room and bed, well heated outdoor pool. Breakfast very good as was dinner. Limited close parking but additional space behind hotel. Went in May during 20 deg days and room was warm so as no aircon could be hot in high summer!"
5055,The Royal Hotel,"Spent an enjoyable 2 day break at the Royal. Lovely old fashioned hotel with helpful, friendly staff. Very clean. Only drawback was room was very warm even with no heating on and only 17°C outside. Not sure would cope in height of summer!"
5056,The Royal Hotel,"We had a fantastic 5 day break at the Royal Hotel. The restaurant was excellent, food was superb with friendly and well trained staff - in fact all the staff were good. Our room on the second floor was a good size and well equipped with a sea view. The hotel is situated within walking distance of the town centre and Botanical Gardens and within easy reach of attractions on the island."
5057,The Royal Hotel,"This was our first stay at The Royal, my Mum and I, and it was nothing but excellent. Very welcoming receptionist on arrival. Evening meals and breakfast in the restaurant was delicious and service was exemplary. All round the staff were very obliging and helpful. Our room was very clean, and daily housekeeping. Beautiful gardens and views! Would definitely stay here again. 5 * all round!"
5058,The Royal Hotel,"3 night repeat visit was as good as ever. Outstanding hotel on all fronts, room, dining, staff and gardens. Our visit clashed with the retirement of a long serving respected member of staff and we were delighted to be included in the celebrations. Can’t wait to return."
5059,The Royal Hotel,This hotel has the exemplary service that you seldom find today. The location is convenient with a short walk to town or the seafront. (Although quite a steep walk to the sea) We enjoyed 4 nights and had dinner there twice. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.
5060,The Royal Hotel,"Had a wonderful trip to IOW for my girlfriend's 40th birthday, and very pleased with the choice of staying at the Royal Hotel. A charming hotel, if slightly dated, with excellent service and wonderful food and wine for dinner. It is in an ideal location in Ventnor with beautiful grounds and close to the beach. I highly recommend."
5061,The Royal Hotel,Great value for location and excellent service. Also extremely dog friendly. Room was perfect for us too with dog as very quiet (as requested). Only minor fault was pillows were very uncomfortable. Would highly recommend!
5062,The Royal Hotel,"We have just had a disappointing lunch at the Royal. It is Sunday and the roast beef was good however we were made to feel like second class guests. We arrived and were shown to our table, I asked if we could sit at the next table near the garden, oh no came the answer another guest will be cross with me if you sit there! I am sorry. We sat down and ordered our food but whilst we started eating the awaited VIP guests arrived at the table I described. The waiter greeted them heartedly and they carried on a very long and loud conversation which prevented any conversation between us.us.the waiter stood blocking outanylight from the garden window and we endured this noisy accompaniment whilst we ate .We requested extra gravy but when this arrived we had almost finished eating.…"
5063,The Royal Hotel,"We were traveling with our dog, so need dog friendly hotel. This hotel is excellent for this purpose – really dog friendly. The hotel itself is very good, room are spacious, clean, good mattresses. Hotel staff is extremely helpful, friendly and care. Food is beyond any standards – very delicious! Location is great, close to the beach and town centre. We do not hesitate to recommend it and will come back again. Thank you!"
5064,The Royal Hotel,"Whilst the hotel common areas are nice, the rooms are tatty and incredibly over priced for what they are. Again, whilst a lot of the staff were incredibly friendly, as a couple in our 30s / 40's, we were by far the youngest guests, and were made to feel very unwelcome by some elitist reception staff whom whole demeanour was that of ""you don't belong"" The crux is, this is a lovely older building, being run in a manner of trying to relive what I'm sure was it's glory days from years gone by. As a couple that goes on a great deal of breaks, we would not return"
5065,The Royal Hotel,"The Royal Hotel Ventnor Isle of Wight, is a setting representing the best of Victorian elegance and the highest service provided by the equally helpful and friendly staff throughout. It was a pleasure to revisit and enjoy the surroundings and in particularly the the Restaurant which offers a very high standard of cuisine whether it is Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner, backed by a level of presentation and service even some 5star hotels have forgotten how to do. Well done to all the Team at The Royal - you understand, Standards are everything. Thank you."
5066,The Royal Hotel,"Truly spoiled from arrival to departure. Cosy and calm atmosphere with very obliging and attentive staff. Really enjoyed the food, all my companions special dietary needs catered for too. They even provided mon menu items."
5067,The Royal Hotel,"Booked afternoon tea here as a treat for our last day. £39 per person for champagne tea. When we booked we booked to sit outside as the weather had been so nice, when we arrived we were told we had to sit inside as the outside areas were reserved for residences of the hotel. If we had known this we wouldn’t have bothered. In the bar area it had awful jazz/saxophone music playing the whole time. Staff were so close the whole time we couldn’t have a proper conversation without feeling like we were being listened to. We had to sit with our back to everting looking over the veranda… the majority of the time watching over a unknown couple kissing and eating a cream tea, once they left for the rest of our time there we were staring at their dirty plates and table. The sandwiches were…"
5068,The Royal Hotel,"Very nice hotel, staff excellent, food good. Parking was free and easy. Room was very clean and comfortable. Bathroom could do with an update, but perfectly fine to use. Great location for Ventnor. All in all a very good stay."
5069,The Royal Hotel,Such a comfortable and welcoming hotel. Only stayed the one night and in that time I experienced such a warm and friendly welcome from all staff. They were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The bedroom was cosy and very quiet - my rating for sleep quality given was my own inability to sleep rather than any failing of the hotel! My friend and I enjoyed probably one of the best fillet steaks we have ever eaten at dinner - top marks. I would highly recommend and would come back and visit. Thank you all.
5070,The Royal Hotel,"We enjoyed a lovely relaxing stay in the stunning surroundings of the Royal Ventnor Hotel. The family room was generously sized, with excellent beds and good cupboard space. Service was superb, with fine attention to detail. The dining room is most splendid, which adds to the excellent ambiance of the hotel."
5071,The Royal Hotel,"We love the family feel of The Royal Hotel and the food, service and welcome are always excellent. Ventnor is a lovely seaside town from where many of the islands beautiful walks can be found. We certainly look forward to our annual break at this lovely hotel."
5072,The Royal Hotel,Excellent service and amenities. Lack of heat in room was speedily resolved.Good location for visits to other parts of the island and Ventnor itself is a very nice town with outstanding views.Enjoyable trip.
5073,The Royal Hotel,"We had a wonderful short family say at the Royal. Nothing to much trouble for the hotel team. Room 20 has a distinct sea view, quiet location, good bathroom, powerful shower. The room is clean, housekeeping great. Lovely gardens to sit in, great bar and restaurant service."
5074,The Royal Hotel,Good at this hotel is exceptional We had dinner with friend one being and both my husband and his friend said it’s the best fillet steak they have ever had! The seven taster menu was also exceptional. Service from staff is attentive and personal Bed very comfortable
5075,The Royal Hotel,"Have stayed at the Royal before and found it excellent. Unfortunately this time was a completely different experience the restaurant staff, although very pleasant, but not very efficient lots of small things that made the experience unacceptable Also, there was a constant drone in our room reported to reception and was told someone has been in the loft and there was no noise out there. However, on checkout the person in front of us was complaining of the same noise. I feel the hotel is running on its previous reputation and needs upgrading We left feeling disappointed and upset as we enjoy the Isle of Wight and normally the Royal ."
5076,The Royal Hotel,"Disappointing stay, the hotel has lost quality of days gone bye. Ready for significant refurbishment (Corridors and bathrooms in particular). Hotel heating was lacking, rooms uncomfortably cold. Trip also hindered by many IOW road closures."
5077,The Royal Hotel,"Our 4th visit to the Royal for a midweek break . It doesn't change , if anything it has got better. Don't expect chain hotel conformity the Royal has been going for over 180 years and the rooms vary but all are comfortable. The best are at the front overlooking the gardens or if on the top floor some have a view of the sea. The Restaurant now called the Geranium has an old fashioned ambience but the food is modern in style and excellent. My only slight criticism is that the short menu doesn't vary so those staying more than 4 days may need to repeat . The Manager is aware of this and is considering having one daily changing dish which would be a welcome step. The staff are friendly and efficient. The 3 or 4 day midweek break with Half board and Ferry crossing included is…"
5078,The Royal Hotel,"We stayed overnight at the Royal, it was our wedding anniversary. The main reason for going was to try the restaurant, which did not disappoint. It is one of the best places that we've ever eaten at on the Isle of Wight. The staff are polite, helpful and serve you with a smile on their face, and the crew in the kitchen clearly understand how to produce delightful food. Dining at the Royal is a wonderful experience, much to be reccommended."
5079,The Royal Hotel,"The royal hotel is a wonderful Hotel, we had wonderful service, excellent staff, very polite and nothing was too much trouble. Very clean, light and airy bedrooms. We only had breakfast and snacks in the evening but lovely food and plenty of choice. Fast and efficient service. lovely trip of memories. Exactly as we remember it 30 years ogo."
5080,The Royal Hotel,"The Royal is a wonderful hotel in a superb location overlooking Ventnor. It offers a great combination of understated elegance, comfortable rooms and modern fine dining. The restaurant is outstanding, as are the staff."
5081,The Royal Hotel,"Another wonderful stay. Everything up to standard as usual. Always good to see Caroline on Reception and Davinia was also lovely. We had a significant issue (nothing of the Hotel's making) and Paul, the Deputy Manager dealt with it superbly for whiuch we are hugely grateful."
5082,The Royal Hotel,"It's a little like a time warp... but in all the best ways. Staff who smile, are beautifully dressed formally and really care about you and take time to talk to you. I kept expecting Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot to come wandering in - it has that feeling of 'Old World grandeur' and a genteel atmosphere. There is no 'canned pop music' forcing it's way into you day, just a beautiful piano playing in the evenings. We had a seaview and awaking to the view was amazing. The walk down to the sea is not for the faint hearted and bewars, it is steep, but worthwhile the effort if you do brave the mountaineering! The car park is opposite which is fine, but not very large , we just managed to squeeze into an awkward space at the end, but in the high season, parking in there may possibly…"
5083,The Royal Hotel,"Wonderful hotel - we had a fabulous stay last weekend. The staff ware all so very helpful and welcoming, dinner and breakfast were delicious. the rooms were very well appointed, spacious and comfortable - even the dog friendly room. and the views are wonderful."
5084,The Royal Hotel,"The Royal is a very elegant traditional hotel. It is very comfortable and the food delicious. All the staff were polite, attentive and helpful. Our room was very comfortable , good size. There was ample car parking facilities in 2 carparks."
5085,The Royal Hotel,"Excellent place to stay Staff very friendly and nothing to much trouble Great service, food was very enjoyable Would recommend the Royal Hotel to everyone Only did a one night stay but could of happily stayed longer"
5086,The Royal Hotel,"The shower facility was a let down. Very little water pressure and a curtain rather than glass made it an unpleasant experience. That said the hotel itself is beautiful and the service is amazing. Wonderful, friendly staff and the food superb, especially breakfast."
5087,The Royal Hotel,Everything we expected and more. The staff looked after us and we had a fabulous time thank you so much.. Look forward to visiting next year God willing. The weather was very kind to us and we enjoyed our walks around the gardens and the resort. Its like stepping back in time when standards were important and customer care was paramount. Always a smile !
5088,The Royal Hotel,"Three nights dinner, bed and breakfast stay at this hotel. The property is dated and the bathrooms in particular could do with updating but that said the rooms are spacious and the beds comfortable. The food was excellent and the service first class."
5089,The Royal Hotel,"A very comfortable stay with exemplary service and high quality food in delightful surroundings. All members of the team were dedicated, helpful and a credit to the hotel. Friends joined us for dinner on our first evening and were most impressed!"
5090,The Royal Hotel,An outstanding hotel. From the moment we were welcomed by Caroline on reception until we departed we thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of our stay. The staff were attentive but not intrusive. We stayed in room 5 which was large overlooking the front gardens. It was immaculate and clearly well maintained. We stayed for 2 nights. The restaurant is first class both in terms of quality and quantity of food and once again the staff members present could not have been more helpful and welcoming. Perhaps (small gripe) a daily dinner special would avoid having to choose from the same menu each evening The food though did not disappoint. This was our second visit to the Royal and we would recommend without hesitation
5091,The Royal Hotel,"Lovely hotel, our 4th time here, and we just love it, our room overlooking the pool and sea. Food was lovely, my only gripe is same menu every night! Please change it daily. We will return as soon as we can. Lovely little cafe’s in Ventnor overlooking the sea."
5092,The Royal Hotel,We were booked in for a four day mini break but wish we had booked for longer. Everything about this hotel is perfection and it seems to pride itself on good old fashioned traditional values. We had a room overlooking the front garden with a sea view - you can't get much better than that when awaking in the morning. The food in the restaurant was outstanding (don't miss the cheese souffle starter) all the staff were just brilliant and we can't wait to return next year.
5093,The Royal Hotel,"Wonderful relaxing stay with excellent food, comfortable room and staff that were friendly and accomodating. I have mobility issues and the hotel provided reserved parking, our luggge was taken to our room for us, We were spoilt rotten."
5094,The Royal Hotel,"What a treat to stay in this delightful place! Excellent service from the moment we arrived and the meals (dinner and breakfast) were something very special to look forward to each day. All the staff were friendly, polite and professional. The rooms were beautiful and the beds comfortable. We were staying as guests using the hotel's winter break offer, which included ferry crossings and was very good value. Would highly recommend. If you decide, reading this, to try it for yourselves, remember many of the tourist attractions and eateries on the island are shut during the winter. We found enough to do but it is worth doing your research first. The hotel itself is completely open (except for the outdoor pool!) and does not disappoint."
5095,The Royal Hotel,"This is a real jewel of a hotel. Everything about the property is lovely from the rooms to the outside areas. The location is great with excellent restaurants, cafes and pubs nearby. But the best bit about the royal is the service. Coming from a former travelling salesman, they give the best service I’ve ever had in a hotel. The food is outstanding too. The bar is pricey but overall it’s worth every penny. Enjoy"
5096,The Royal Hotel,"This was our first stay at The Royal and we booked the dine and stay option. What a freak. From the moment we arrived, there was a lovely calm atmosphere. Our room was well appointed and very clean. The views out to see were amazing. The staff were wonderful, attentive and knowledgeable. Daniel was a brilliant waiter at dinner. The food was delicious at both dinner and breakfast. We will definitely be back for another stay. Thank you"
5097,The Royal Hotel,A second trip to the Royal Hotel. We can back again because we enjoyed it so much last time. The staff throughout the hotel were hugely attentive to all our needs. Dining is a real highlight of this hotel. Both breakfasts and dinners are excellent. Service in the restaurant is of the highest order (Daniel particularly good) An outstanding 3 night stay. Thoroughly recommended.
5098,The Royal Hotel,We enjoyed our stay immensely and would love to come again Piped music in the lovely dining room is completely unnecessary. The food was outstanding and the staff smiled a lot. WE particularly appreciated a reseved parking spot by the hotel entrance.
5099,The Royal Hotel,"Scones rated up with the best I’ve tasted. Evening meal excellent. All food beautifully served by friendly and helpful staff. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was a dream, with everything you could think of. Fruit yogurt, cereals, all manner of cooked food. The haddock and poached egg with hollandaise sauce was particularly enjoyable."
5100,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Not much to add to the many excellent reviews for the Apex City of Glasgow Hotel on Bath St. We had booked a Superior Double for 4 nights in early May but due to a change of plans had to stay another 2 nights and the hotel was excellent in working out us staying in the same room. We were in Rm 101, nicely furnished, very clean and very quiet (really heard nothing during the visit). There was a window but no view, just the wall of the adjacent building, perhaps the Superior rooms on higher floors have views? Wifi was normally excellent but there was the occasional outage later in the evenings. Front desk staff were excellent and the location of the hotel couldn't be better with Buchanan street a few blocks away and Sauchiehall (Tesco Express, Boots, Pret a Manager, Starbucks,…"
5101,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,I've stayed in the Apex hotel many times and always have an amazing stay . Staff are very friendly and helpful making the experience so much better . It is close to down town making it easy to get around . Would definitely recommend it to others.
5102,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Booked by Overseas Adventure Travel. Good internet. Small elevator. Good breakfast included in rate (optional). Very well located for many tourist attractions. Modern fixtures and comfortable bed. Big screen TV above the desk. Very well insulated from street noise. AC worked well.
5103,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"We stayed at Apex’s Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Waterloo hotels during our trip. The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly. Any question we asked or help we needed, they provided it with pleasure, often anticipating out needs before we did. The rooms were lovely and well appointed and the costs were reasonable. We would absolutely choose Apex Hotels again."
5104,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"The Staff were of the highest calibre. Nothing was too much trouble, you only had to ask. The room we were in was super comfortable and spotlessly clean, with everything on hand. The bed so comfortable it was if we being caressed into our sleep. If you are going to visit Glasgow, then Apex Hotel 110 Bath Street is the best place to be your home from home. Apex Hotel definitely wins my vote. I would most certainly stay there again. :-)"
5105,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Lovely stay rooms are nice and big and couldn’t fault anything with the room beds were nice and comfy,iron and ironing board in the cupboard it saved me asking for a iron,tea and coffee provided overal a very pleasant stay"
5106,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Just an okay hotel. We booked a last-minute room at this hotel. Our room (supposedly a larger family room) was tiny and very dark. It really could use a make-over. Breakfast was surprisingly good (considering what our room was like). Staff in the restaurant was very friendly. We probably won’t stay at an Apex hotel again. But thank you to the restaurant staff for your friendly and attentive service.
5107,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"If you want to explore central Glasgow with no pressure this is the location for you. Situated on Bath street it is a stones throw away from Buchanan Street, Sauchiehall Street and Hope St. The staff are all friendly and helpful and most of all you feel safe. Perfect for the solo female traveller of any age and other groups and its less than 20 minutes from Glasgow International by car. I will definately use this as my base on my return to Glasgow."
5108,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"The staff tried their best, having first tried to get me to switch hotels, but it took 15 mins to check in, when it should take 2. Hotel is well located and rooms are tidy and clean, but the check in experience really hurts the brand."
5109,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Saw a deal for their afternoon tea on Itison and liked that it said you got a choice of a small plate as well as sandwiches, a scone and cake. I went for the mixed pakora and dip as my small plate. The food was all delicious, fresh and so filling. Service was great too. Thanks again."
5110,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"We spent two nights at the Apex in Glasgow in late April 2023. The staff at the front desk very friendly and helpful with our questions, pointing us in the right directions around town. The hotel is in good location and only 10 minute walk to George’s square were we picked up our walking tour. The hotel room was clean. Bathroom was good size with walk in hot shower. The only minor item is the continental breakfast is limited with cereals and deli meat if you are used to more options. But still filling to start the day. Would stay here again on our next trip to Glasgow."
5111,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"The room was very tight fitting with 3 adult woman in it, when the couch bed was pulled out. We would have preferred a more comfortable setting, more floor space to move around. Possible next time this room is booked you can ask customers how many adults will be occupying the room. Customer Service and your front desk staff were excellent! Thank you."
5112,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Hotel clean and staff friendly. However, noise from the air conditioning/venting continuous and so loud it is not possible to sleep (loud enough to be recorded on a mobile phone). Staff unable to assist despite repeat requests - including 3am in desperation! On departure it was arranged for the General Manager to email me to discuss. This never happened. Company booking so I was not looking for compensation just that the problem had been rectified for other guests. For information I was on the 8th floor This hotel has been red-flagged for any future trips to Glasgow and company bookings."
5113,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Other than the arrival experience and the auto lighting issue, everything is brilliant. Location, room, welcome drinks, shower facilities are awesome. Would consider stay again while staying in Glasgow. Noodle bar next door is a must-eat restaurant"
5114,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Booked this as an overnight stay, as we were travelling to Glasgow for a concert. We had a previous stay here, the room was clean and tidy. The bed was so comfortable and pillows were to die for. We didn't have any food at the hotel, as we had a meal booked."
5115,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Very nice hotel rooms, nice welcoming staff and a decent breakfast choice offered.no gym but one next door. Big problem is that the area is just too noisy through the night and sounded like every nightclub in town spilled out to the street in the early hours."
5116,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Stay in room 807 was beautiful. Check in was genuinely welcoming and smooth. Booked Prosecco on arrival for room as surprise for my partners 30th and they even made a card. All the staff are all fabulous
5117,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Afternoon arrival, room was ready, keys issued promptly with a warm welcome . The hotel is in a good location with plenty to see and do nearby. Room was small but clean and cosy with a nice comfortable bed and good bathroom. Shower was powerful and relaxing. Room was well soundproofed , the restaurant area looked tempting but I didn’t have time to sample the delights on offer . I had a good nights sleep, the front desk staff were friendly and professional and had good knowledge of the local area."
5118,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,No open points .I#m happy to attaend this review to got the chance to rate your hotel. Breakfast was good but the fish could be a bit bigger and smother. I was really happy to book diectly at the hotel to get the chance using the mini-bar.
5119,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,From the moment we walked in we were welcomed from very friendly staff and everytime we left and came back in was the same staff very polite chatty smiles all round the room was just well we were speachless we even left on the time we were suppose to we didnt want to leave it was amazing thank you very much
5120,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"What a nice hotel! Modern, clean and welcoming! The staff is super nice and helpful. Our room, on the 7th floor, looked out over the city and had those funky diagonal windows. We ate in the restaurant one night because it was pouring rain and we were the only people there. Although the food was moderately priced, it was just okay. We were most disappointed with the lack of lobby area to gather."
5121,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Apex has the most incredible view of Glasgow and does it justice with an equally incredible room. Very comfortable couch and bed and very good service. Staff were all lovely and understanding of any request. Although our safe malfunctioned, this wasnt a major issue and the staff were very apologetic. The minibar had great choice although the coffee from the coffee machine did not taste nice, this was mainly due to personal preference and Nescaffe (not the hotel's own coffee). Dinner at the hotel was lovely and very reasonable price wise and the staff were, as always, very polite and kind. The rooms were always made presentable by cleaning staff and the only grime found was some by the shower drain and some in the fridge however this did not dampen the experience at all. Overall,…"
5122,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Lovely modern hotel. Great location for all amenities, including train & bus stations. Nice, good-sized room, spotlessly clean, great shower with gorgeous toiletries. Lovely friendly staff on reception easy & quick check in. Would definitely stay again."
5123,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Very welcoming staff both at check in and departure. Night reception also very helpful.Room spacious, comfortable and clean. Location great, central and within walking distance of many great restaurants."
5124,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Compact but clean and comfy rooms. No parking on-site but it’s only about 1 min walk from hotel and at a discounted rate for guests. Good location, close to lots of great bars and restaurants. The lady who checked us in was SO lovely, for memory her name was Laura, she even took all our bags to our room whilst we parked our car, nothing was too much trouble for her and she made the stay a memorable one."
5125,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Very friendly & courteous staff on reception from first stepping foot into the hotel until last engagement. Leaves a good impression. Location of hotel is bang in the middle of Glasgow, less than 10 minutes from both main train stations and bus station, with shopping and bars & restaurants also no more than 10 minutes away."
5126,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,I’ve stayed here a number of times now. The staff are super helpful and friendly and have made my experiences very enjoyable. I love getting the rubber duck each time. When I am in Glasgow with work I bring a duck back to my girlfriend which lets her see the bright side of me being away so much.
5127,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"We needed a hotel for a 3 day visit to Glasgow, and chose the Apex Hotel from reading good reviews. We were not disappointed - this is a nice hotel. First - it's very clean. Everywhere was spotless. Second, the staff are excellent - cheerful, polite, helpful and friendly. The hotel itself looks like it's been shoehorned into Bath St from space. It doesn't match any of the neighboring buildings - but Glasgow is an architectural riot anyway, so no reason that it should. The glass front of the hotel slants over the street like the bridge of a ship, offering good views from the higher floors. My room was pretty nice - not huge (standard double), but big enough to move round easily enough. There's enough wardrobe space, somewhere to put the suitcase, and an iron, hairdryer if you…"
5128,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,What a lovely friendly place to stay. Oisin on reception could not have been more accommodating. Very helpful with information for restaurants etc. wouldn’t let me carry my bag up the stairs. Such a very pleasant young man. Not badly placed for amenities. Room was very clean and well presented. With strict instructions to ring reception for anything we required. Lifts useful for those of us who don’t do stairs very well.
5129,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Easy walking disrance to V&A Dundee & the waterfront.. Parking is around back (not obvious). Very good value. Modern, clean, everything works. Friendly staff, nice bar area. We didn't try the restaurant but it looks nice."
5130,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"We stayed here just for one night to celebrate my birthday and wish we'd stayed longer! The location is brilliant, just a few minutes away from the bus station/train stations/shops etc. The staff are exceptionally welcoming, friendly and helpful. They even provide a cute little rubber duck in each room - gimmicky yes but we love ducks. Our room (706) was huge with stunning views across the city. Everything was incredibly clean and the shower was amazing - so powerful! The bed was super comfortable and the air con worked well. My only small criticism is there's a LOT of noise from street level even 7 floors up (there's a karaoke bar next door and student halls across the road) so perhaps better soundproofing could be invested in, but it wouldn't stop us staying again -…"
5131,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"This hotel is amazing, 5stars from us. Clean, amazing facilities and super friendly staff that are always happy to help. This was my friends 1st time in Glasgow and his first ever concert and it was an amazing stay. Love the duck idea too and my friend was the cheeky one asking if he could have a duck to take home too!"
5132,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Hotel was amazing recommend to everyone had no issues with hotel- clean tidy welcoming and amazing staff, sorry about the 2 rooms friends left a mess. I did go in and clean them clearly after your pics"
5133,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Great location in the centre of Glasgow. Parking in the City Centre is costly however there is a Q car park beside the hotel and reception provided a code for 50% reduction. The hotel facilities are very good. Modern rooms and a nice overall vibe. I would recommend this hotel.
5134,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"As the title suggests, my stay was ruined by a running toilet which wasn’t addressed when raised to the reception team. But the overall hotel and location was absolutely perfect and good value for money."
5135,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Excellent city centre hotel. Rooms comfortable and well appointed. Good lighting . Nice shower. Friendly staff - willing and eager to help. Food - limited but adequate and all that is required. Plenty restaurants on door-step.
5136,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Booked here for a nice relaxing couple of nights with my husband. Room was alot smaller than advertised, not alot of space to move around. In need of some TLC. The heating didn't work on the first night so the whole room was like a fridge (even the bed under the covers) the 2nd night was like a sweat box and the air con just doesn't go cold or even nearly go round the room. Constant banging doors all night. Hotel is lovely but the room was a massive let down"
5137,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Hello apex! Thank you for having me! I had a really beautiful stay thank you, everyone on the desk was really friendly and helpful and the room was beautiful with everything I needed. If I’m ever back in Glasgow (which hopefully I never am) I will most definitely return! The down side of my stay was unfortunately I went on a date that evening, the guy (Simon) was very rude, not a gentleman at all and gave a negative feeling to the hotel room- he appreciated nothing. I’d actually go as far as saying he was the rudest guy I had met, and of course left me in tears. Just thought I’d jazz up this trip advisor review slightly. :) No Simon’s allowed in apex. Don’t be like Simon. Girls stay away from Glasgow Simon. Hugs, Lisa xx"
5138,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Lovely experience. Staff welcoming and service great. We stayed one night and booked the deal through itison- great value for money. Lovely room, cosy, 3 small plates were lovely too. cant complain about anything"
5139,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Stayed there on Saturday 4th of March. On arriving home on Sunday I realised I had forgotten to lift my iPad charger. I called them straight away to ask if it had been found ( I called 2 hours after check out) I was told they would check and call me back. No body called back so I called them on Monday to be told it was not there. I then said so it’s either vanished in mid air or there cleaners have took it to which I was told they don’t know. The person in the phone could not be more uninterested if he tried. AVOID
5140,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"I do love the Apex group hotels, this one is great, a good location and helpful staff. Try to get a front facing room to get the best view all very well presented. Breakfast is very tasty. I will return for further visits when I’m back in Glasgow soon."
5141,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"A very good hotel in a perfect location for my stay. Very friendly staff from the first meeting to the last in all departments. Very clean and comfortable. Perfect in every aspect. It was the first time that I have stayed there, and I won't hesitate to stay again but, I wouldn't go to the bother of booking a 'City View'. All one gets is a view of the street. I find the description of 'City View' misleading and it spoilt my stay because I was expecting a view of the city. I felt let disappointed. A simple thing to rectify by Apex. It's about managing expectations. I had mine raised and the dashed. It's a pity because in all other aspects my stay exceeding expectaions."
5142,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Staff, and I mean every single one of them, we’re highly responsive, energetically engaged and professional. This may mean great Mgmt & training. We had a minor dripping drain, fixed while we were out; an extra blanket request, Done!; any requests of the front desk were met in the moment with no wait at all (adequate staffing, a rare thing, post-Covid). Room was nice; mattress great. Food and coffee in the on premises cafe/restaurant were both surprisingly good and inexpensive. Don’t let the bland decor fool you. But the atmosphere actually kept us away at first! Again, Glasgow benefits from a truly cosmopolitan mix of local and immigrant citizens, most proud to be of service, unlike other major cities. Being greeted and looked in the eye by Apex staff was only a beginning…"
5143,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Brilliant hotel, clean, friendly staff, location good over lovely stay. The rooms were very modern and spacious, very hand too shops and bars staff very helpful. Had a brilliant time will definitely be back"
5144,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"This hotel is in an excellent location - just five blocks from an airport bus drop off/pickup, one block from Sauciehall Street and a few blocks from Buchanan Street (both pedestrian shopping streets). The reception staff were friendly and helpful and the room spacious and clean with a good-sized modern bathroom, big windows, and a desk you can actually work at. I will definitely return if visiting Glasgow again."
5145,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Received an overnight stay as a gift. Checked pre arrival re. Parking and directed to Q park which is about 50 yards away on Bath Street. 50% discount for guests but the reception staff need to k ow that’s where you’ve parked to secure that discount. £25 reduced to £12.50 for 24hrs. Oisin (I think dealt with that phonecall then checked us on arrival. Very the polite and efficient. Room was very comfortable. Huge bed and clean bedding and towels. Yes this should be a given, but it’s not always. We were on floor 2 overlooking Bath Street and it was a little noisy with traffic and the odd siren and folk shouting after pub closing but nothing excessive. You could ask for a higher floor or a different aspect. It didn’t bother us. Bathroom was well stocked and modern with a walk…"
5146,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,Great location for the train station and shopping precinct. Staff very friendly and helpful. I would recommend for a short stay in Glasgow. Recommend the breakfast. Staff helpful with information regarding Glasgow.
5147,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Myself and my husband film hotel room tours for youtube, when we came across the duplex suite we knew we had to stay! All was well at first, lovely Irish lad (his name begin with an O , but unfortunately can't remember) on the reception took his time to check us in and even recommended apps for us to download regarding the local cinema so that wall great. The room itself was great, a few imperfections but these can be looked past. Then what we can only describe as an only fans session started next door, the banging , screaming and just all round noise was even overpowering the TV. I was straight in the phone to reception who did seem horrified in their respect. The noise continued and what sounded like a party then started in the same room. I phoned reception again to be…"
5148,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Great location, great hotel. Stayed for a shopping trip with daughter. Room was very modern. Only thing I was missing was marmalade during the breakfast but could have asked for more. Would stay again."
5149,Apex City of Glasgow Hotel,"Room very nice, great value for money. Staff brilliant and location excellent. However walls were thin as me and my partner could hear every little detail of the couple next door enjoying their private time, including ’climaxing’ and the spanking. We also found a large shard of glass on our floor near the bed before one stepped on it."
5150,The King's Head Hotel,"This was our first time at The Kings Head Hotel and will not be our last. The location is fantastic, right on the market Square! The room was spacious and very well appointed. We had an evening meal in the restaurant as part of the Coaching Escapes deal which was excellent. The breakfast offered a good selection of things from the buffet together with a range of cooked breakfasts. What makes this hotel very special is that the staff in all areas are superb. We look forward to our next visit."
5151,The King's Head Hotel,Cannot fault the Kings Head on any level the sleep comfort was good. Sfaff were friendly and hospitable the quality and variety of the food on offer was excellent but the breafast Eggs Benedict were in a class of their own. Would definitely stay again
5152,The King's Head Hotel,"Always enjoy staying at The Kings Head but as I was on my own this time, single rooms are on the second floor then up a few more steps which was difficult for me. Excellent bar and restaurant, I only had breakfasts this time but have eaten evening meals before and always good."
5153,The King's Head Hotel,"We have had a wonderful nights stay at The King's Head Hotel. We booked a Classic Plus Room which was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Lovely finishing touches in the room and we enjoyed a peaceful night's sleep! I am vegan and it is such a refreshing change to have evening meal and breakfast options on the menu without any fuss. The food was lovely and we will definitely return. Lovely staff and 10/10 for a great stay, Thank you :)"
5154,The King's Head Hotel,"We couldn’t fault anything. From the time we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. All the staff were friendly and helpful, whilst remaining professional. The room was comfy and tastefully decorated plus little extras such as bottled water and a radio which was a nice touch. Breakfast was brilliant and our 2 evening meals were well cooked and excellent value for money. It was also great to see the hotel being used by locals for morning coffee, afternoon tea and drinks in the outside seating area. We would definitely return."
5155,The King's Head Hotel,Lovely hotel in a great location! We had a travelzoo deal which was excellent value for money two night stay with breakfast include. The breakfast was very nice plenty of choice the only downside was our room was very noisey(201) & light was like sleeping in day light! Would stay again but hope for a quieter room.
5156,The King's Head Hotel,Able to use the Sunday night special over the May BH weekend. It includes a bottle of Prosecco and B&B. Had complimentary upgrade to Richmond Room (101) which was delightful. Breakfast excellent. Overlooked the Market Square which was a bit noisy but not too bad. Parked outside town centre and walked in. Not many places will book a one night stay over a BH weekend so was pleased. Great walking from hotel. Great pubs in and around square and plenty of places to eat.
5157,The King's Head Hotel,"Our first stay in Richmond and whilst the King's Head had it's faults we liked it and would return. The hotel could not be better located on the market place in the centre of Richmond, and building itself is a splendid mix of traditional with a more contemporary bar and restaurant area. Our room was a standard double which was clean, comfortable and well appointed. Any failings could be put down to the historic nature of the building, and therefore forgiven. Service for breakfast was on the tardy side of relaxed, but when it arrived the food was very nice, this was also the case for dinner but here one of our main courses left a little to be be desired on the taste front."
5158,The King's Head Hotel,"We can fault nothing with this hotel. From entering to leaving we loved every second. We came to celebrate mu hisbands 60th birthday and it was perfection. Every member of staff were amazing, breakfasts delicious, room was simply gorgeous, hotel itself excellent. We coming back in August for my birthday. Superb x"
5159,The King's Head Hotel,"We have just returned from a 2 night stay at this wonderful hotel situated in the heart of Richmond. Everything was wonderful and we would gladly stay here again, the hotel and rooms are of an excellent standard and the staff were brilliant. Parking is available at £10 per night which is worth it considering the location."
5160,The King's Head Hotel,"This is a most comfortable hotel, with a fine welcome. On a cool weather trip, this was a warm and comfortable hotel, with the bonus of its location in the Market Square at the town's centre. A good variety of breakfast options to set visitors up for their days out, too!"
5161,The King's Head Hotel,"Stayed here for 2 nights on a Travelzoo deal and it was great value. The staff were all delightful and the breakfast was excellent. We also ate in the restaurant one night and the quality of the meal was very good. There's a great decking area out the front the hotel on the market square and it's a great place for a drink in the sunshine. The hotel is very dog friendly, but we didn't hear any noise at night. The only negative was the hotel was very warm, including the bedroom, but we'd rather be warm than cold and we were able to regulate the temperature by opening the windows. The bedroom was a high quality and although we looked out onto a slate roof, we didn't complain as the deal and the staff were so good. Very highly recommended."
5162,The King's Head Hotel,"We had noticed this hotel sitting nicely in the square at Richmond and thought it would be nice to stay a night and explore the area more fully. We were not disappointed at all. The staff were very friendly, the hotel had a good vibe about it and the bedrooms were well presented. The bathroom were modernised with top quality toiletries. The breakfasts were delicious with plenty of choice."
5163,The King's Head Hotel,It's a beautiful hotel on the Market Square. The rooms are spotless and very comfortable with everything you need. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food and service is excellent. I highly recommend it.
5164,The King's Head Hotel,We had a lovely 2 night stay at the Kings Head. The bedroom was well furnished and the bed was huge and comfortable. The only downside was the room was too warm due to central pipes that were hot all the time and could not be regulated. There was plenty of choice at breakfast and the service was good. Overall a quality hotel and we would definitely return.
5165,The King's Head Hotel,I booked this hotel through Travelzoo for two rooms but due to illness we were unable to attend. Just beware of small print as I have lost my money including car parking fee if £15. Will not be using coaching inn group again !!
5166,The King's Head Hotel,"Visited on a busy bank holiday weekend forlunch, there was plenty of staff so no waiting to order or be brought out. Outdoor area is very nice particularly on a sunny day. The food was excellent and so we're the staff."
5167,The King's Head Hotel,I would definitely come back ! Team were excellent and friendly. Very dog friendly. Room was spacious and looked over market place. Bottled water in room which so many hotels have stopped..breakfast plentiful and of high standard. Highly recommended hotel
5168,The King's Head Hotel,"This was a first time in Richmond for us and a fairly late booking and we didn’t quite know what to expect of the hotel. It’s ideally situated on the town square and has the advantage of a car park which is a bonus. Very clean hotel with quite roomy bedrooms, a nice bar area and eating spaces. Found the staff to be very welcoming and friendly. Very clean hotel and was particularly pleased with the cleaning staff who made great daily job of the bedroom. Eat twice in the restaurant and food was very good on both occasions. Excellent breakfast with a good choice. Would recommend a visit. The only caveat is that in high season it’s location could also bring some noise from the square outside."
5169,The King's Head Hotel,"The room was comfortable and well equipped. Being right in the square, it was a lovely place to stay. we were on half board and the food was excellent. The staff were friendly and very attentive. Couldn't fault anything."
5170,The King's Head Hotel,"Indirect discrimination at bar/restaraunt. Wont take cash would have left if my friend hadnt already paid for hers (she had to pay for mine too). Refused my £20 note. Place was really quiet, rest of Richmond busy. Still expect tips in cash tbough. Wont be returning."
5171,The King's Head Hotel,Just returned home from a 2 night stay at the Kings Head . On arrival we had been upgraded to a superior room . The room was lovely spacious and comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly and the service was excellent . Breakfast was delicious and plentiful.. Have been visiting Richmond for 10 years and this was our first stay at the hotel will definitely return .
5172,The King's Head Hotel,"The food and service were very good. The locally brewed / distilled beer / gin are worth having, also supporting the local community. We plan to visit again. Did not stay there hence cannot comment on bedrooms"
5173,The King's Head Hotel,"We were in a deluxe room right on the front corner of the hotel which overlooked the main square. The room was absolutely fine, but on the Saturday night the noise from outside was really bad resulting in very poor sleep for my wife and me which impacted the whole of the next day too. We were just told it's because the hotel is near Catterick barracks, and the soldiers often come into the local pubs at the weekend. So be aware of thus. Also the lock on our door was faulty which meant we could not lock it when we left the room (101). As it was the weekend, there was no maintenance available. This hotel could do with a residents lounge because the comfy seats in the lounge were usually all occupied by general customers, which meant no room for residents."
5174,The King's Head Hotel,"overall a nice hotel with great staff, although the building & decor needs updating/refreshing. room was clean. the dinning room was dirty, stained chairs & food on the floor at breakfast time. the actual breakfast was very good."
5175,The King's Head Hotel,"This has become my 'go to' places to stay. What a fabulous couple of nights. The staff were amazing, very friendly and helpful. its just a 'wow' place for me. The room was spotless. the food was to die for. the staff were like old friends we never met before. I cant wait to go back again with my sister."
5176,The King's Head Hotel,"An enjoyable return visit. All the staff work collectively to provide a very positive experience. Breakfast was excellent and evening meal was very good. Room was quiet, comfortable and clean. Car parking now incurs a separate charge."
5177,The King's Head Hotel,"First time at this lovely hotel, found everywhere, homely, clean, very friendly and attentive staff, nothing was too much trouble. Did not have dinner here but the breakfast was good. Only drawback was the limited parking at the back for which you had to pay for. Only alternative was to go on the long stay car park nearby. Other than that everything was fine and we would consider coming back again."
5178,The King's Head Hotel,"Service appalling! Food, In my opinion hotel restaurant prices for gastro pub quality! High chair filthy. Waited twenty minutes at bar and didn't see one member of staff! No reply to letter of complaint."
5179,The King's Head Hotel,"Great location for everything very comfortable room and communal areas, very friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast was excellent with a great choice. Would definitely go back for another visit hopefully soon"
5180,The King's Head Hotel,"Just had an overnight stay with my husband. Everything was perfect, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. We ate in the restaurant and the food was very good and not expensive. Room was very clean and had everything we needed. Hotel is in a perfect spot right in the market place. Would definitely go again."
5181,The King's Head Hotel,"As usual everything was fine, apart from the noisy banging of the front door whilst we were trying to have a relaxing evening. I am sue a soft closer could have been fitted to stop this from happening every time someone either entered or left the hotel"
5182,The King's Head Hotel,"Great two night stay at The King's Head Hotel. Room (104), staff and food were excellent. Richmond and the surrounding area are a joy to explore. Special mention to the Georgian Theatre & welcoming staff where we attended two events. Plus the Station Cinema. Can't wait to return."
5183,The King's Head Hotel,"A grand looking hotel with beautiful interior to match. We stayed in a front superior room overlooking market square for 3 nights. (Room 205). Very comfortable Room. Housekeeping spot on. Reception and bar/front of house staff lovely, professional and accommodating. The meal we had on first evening was delicious. The atmosphere in the hotel is nice and relaxed. It is very popular with locals for coffee meet ups which speaks volumes because there are many coffee shops/cafes and bars right in the doorstep but so many choose the Kings Head. Our puppy was also made to feel very welcome and he loved the space of the corridors upstairs for a ‘supervised’ zoomie session! Secure car park at rear for a nominal fee (pre-book). Lots of places to walk to right from the door. We will…"
5184,The King's Head Hotel,"I called into the hotel for lunch with a friend. Having sat down in the restaurant for ten minutes without any member of staff acknowledging us I was informed by another guest we had to order at the bar. The manager was abrupt, bordering on rude with her staff. Having asked how my meal was because I'd left 90% of my steak. I told her it had a sour taste and a pungent smell to which she replied ""I've sold lots of them today and nobody else has complained"". No apology, no recognition just aggression! The manager then actively ignored us even after making a desert order she didn't relay to the kitchen. Shocking service at best. Serious training needed."
5185,The King's Head Hotel,"Imposing old building in a great location, providing a comfortable stay, helped by excellent service from friendly staff. I would definitely recommend Richmond and the Kings Head Hotel without hesitation."
5186,The King's Head Hotel,"Lovely night away in a lovely hotel. We we treated to a room upgrade on arrival, beautiful room, huge bed. The staff were attentive and helpful. Breakfast was lovely with a good continental selection and cooked breakfast options, especially the Eggs Royale The location was ideal, right on the market square. Would definitely stay here again"
5187,The King's Head Hotel,This hotel is perfect for a break at any time of the year. The staff are all very friendly and polite and the service is first class. The attention to detail in the hotel makes it one of the top hotels we have stayed in. Richmond is beautiful and we will definitely return. Thank you for having us!! (Again)
5188,The King's Head Hotel,"We loved this hotel. It’s in the heart of the market town of Richmond, North Yorkshire. I personally would suggest you prebook (the chargeable) parking as the car park is small and it takes away the worry of finding somewhere nearby. The hotel is fairly large for this style, very characterful and charming. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room a really good size (just watch your head in the beams!). Richmond offers a multitude of bars, restaurants and cafes so we only ate breakfast in the hotel, which was really good and plentiful. All the staff members we encountered were helpful and pleasant. Highly recommended, will definitely return."
5189,The King's Head Hotel,"The King’s Head hotel is situated right in the middle of Richmond and is an excellent place to stay. The staff are attentive, friendly and very helpful. The hotel itself is clean and well maintained. The food is very good, with breakfast cooked to order. I fully recommend this hotel to stay at in Richmond."
5190,The King's Head Hotel,"We had one night in Richmond staying at the Kings Head Hotel. The staff were excellent and could not do enough for us. We would Highley recommend staying at the Kings Head Hotel.From parking the car in the Hotels car park through to Breakfast the following morning , the stay was very pleasant. Well done to the team."
5191,The King's Head Hotel,"My wife and I had never been to Richmond before and are so glad we chose to stay at the Kings Head Hotel. It is centrally located and has an on-site car park. Breakfast is served to your table which is much preferred to the usual buffet style. The hotel seems to well served by the locals who come in for a coffee or quiet drink which is a good sign. The staff we dealt with from the front desk, restaurant, bar and housekeeping were all so friendly and helpful. Hopefully we will be able to visit here again."
5192,The King's Head Hotel,"1 night stay in this lovely hotel. Hotel is very clean, staff extremely friend and location is in the centre of Richmond. This is the second time we have stayed here. Can highly recommend. Great food too."
5193,The King's Head Hotel,"The hotel was fantastic and historic. All the staff from the reception, housekeeping and restaurant and bar staff were super friendly and great with our dog. All the little touches made our stay and we'll definitely return and thank you for making it great!"
5194,The King's Head Hotel,"This hotel is one of our favourites. The location is great for exploring Richmond on foot. The quality of food is very good and the breakfast menu is varied. The hotel is clean and public areas spacious. Our room was lovely, no view, but pleasantly decorated and lovely en-suite. The staff are friendly and welcoming. We will be staying again."
5195,The King's Head Hotel,"What a great hotel, beautiful decore, spotlessly clean, spacious bedrooms but only pub food in the evening. Menu does need looking at. Staff were brilliant. Location to die for. Shame about £15 parking charge which seemed excessive. Richmond is not central London."
5196,The King's Head Hotel,"Prime location in the centre of Richmond's cobbled Market Place. Lovely, stylish hotel. Lucky to have been given a complimentary upgrade on our room, which was overlooking the Market Place. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Had our evening meal there, which was absolutely delicious, followed by drinks in the pleasant bar/lounge area after. Breakfast, too, was just as tasty. Sets you up for the day ahead! Will definitely be returning. Highly recommended if you are looking to stay in the area."
5197,The King's Head Hotel,"With our Labrador Rosey, we visit a lot of dog friendly hotels. This is firmly in the top 3 for us and we will return. It’s a lovely looking place inside and out for starters. Staff couldn’t do enough for us or Rosey. We had tea one night and breakfast twice and it was all top drawer. The lounge area is great and very popular. Thoroughly recommend"
5198,The King's Head Hotel,"Lovely room & attention to detail. Our room had a slipper bath ( but one of the deluxe rooms didn’t so it’s best to check with hotel direct if this is important to you) Nice touches, bottled water, Nespresso machine etc. Breakfast was lovely and would stay again as in the centre of Richmond (on site parking too pricey though) We stayed in Nuns Court long stay-much cheaper & only 5 mins away"
5199,The King's Head Hotel,"Very pleasant surroundings but waited 50 mins for a good sandwich and a very small, small plate. Tea was cold after half an hour so asked for more hot water to warm it up as we were still waiting for food. Water came but still no food. Apparently the till roll had run out and our order had not been transferred to the kitchen.🤨 This we only learned when asking if they had had a problem with our order. No explanation until we asked. Very poor customer service on this occasion."
5200,Hotel de France,"A beautiful hotel with lovely spa facilities, one of the receptionists at the spa was very unhelpful and made our visit feel uncomfortable, not the kind of treatment you go for! All the other staff helpful and friendly and the hairdresser exceptional, going more than that extra mile. Such a shame about the restaurant not a great menu which doesn’t change or excite, we had to go out to eat, there is nothing there to keep you at the hotel, if we ever return to the dwindling Jersey charm, we will stay near the beach front, keep having to get taxis to go out to eat elsewhere was expensive. We won’t be returning."
5201,Hotel de France,It's not expensive. It's OK. Meals are crazy expensive. The hotel thinks it's a 5star but it's not. Comfortable rooms. Some staff are approachable others look down their noses at you lol. Wouldn't race back
5202,Hotel de France,"We recently had a long weekend at the hotel de France to celebrate our 15 year wedding anniversary, the room was lovely, spacious and very clean, the staff were all very happy to help at any time, the spa was nicely laid out and accessible till quite late. We ate in the onsite restaurant for our first evening meal and it was all very well prepared, the steak was cooked perfectly to both our requests (I prefer mine more rare) and all the accompanying bits were cooked perfectly. We'd let the hotel know it was our anniversary prior to arriving and they really helped us make it special with some fizz and a fruit basket in our room on arrival, and some unexpected mini puddings selection after our evening meal in the restaurant all decorated in chocolate with the Happy Anniversary…"
5203,Hotel de France,"The hotel was an easy 15 -20 min stroll into the centre of town. There was plenty of parking on site, nice gardens and attentive and friendly staff. Our room was lovely and had a view to the sea. It was kept clean and refreshed throughout our 3 night stay. We ate in the hotel restaurant and the food and service was excellent. Should we come back to Jersey we wouldn't look for anywhere else to stay. This is a spacious, friendly hotel with excellent facilities."
5204,Hotel de France,"We had a lovely two nights stay at the hotel. Location was really good .. slightly out of town so quite peaceful but just a ten minute or so walk to reach the shops, restaurants and pubs etc. Our Spa bedroom was good … a good size .. plenty of space.. clean and relatively new looking. Would be happy staying in that room again. Breakfast was good. We had a meal one evening in the hotel which was nice overall … the starter was quite small, the main was lovely but the desert was a little below par… but the service was good and all of the staff were very welcoming and friendly. I also had a treatment in the spa which was absolutely gorgeous and left me feeling very chilled out and relaxed. The spa facilities / pool are lovely too. Overall, a good stay all round. Would we…"
5205,Hotel de France,The room was spectacular. Can't fault it. Swimming g pool area was also great. My daughter wanted to go to the gym and on our first day was turned away in a very disappointing manner. After I pointed out we were guests the manner changed slightly. It was as though the lady was doing us a favour. Not a great start. Pool reception were very helpful and polite and friendly. We booked a meal in the restaurant for the first night. When we went for dinner we were greeted by a very loud noise of people have a good time. In the restaurant. The hotel guests had to eat in an area of the bar. Whilst staff were helpful it was not where I had been asked to confirm my table booking. Also the guest from.the party then made.their way I to the bar area and it was so.loud we…
5206,Hotel de France,"We visited recently and were very impressed with both the hotel and facilities. The rooms are especially clean as was the rest of the hotel. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful, and could have done no more for us to have had a better stay. The walk from the centre is nice 20min walk. I would have no worries hesitation in recommending this hotel within my network."
5207,Hotel de France,"Comfortable rooms, impressive building, wonderful spa. The staff in reception and the bar and restaurant were outstanding. It’s a bit of a walk into town but there is a shuttle bus and an excellent public bus service. We all thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
5208,Hotel de France,"We stayed for 6 nights in October 2022. The location was perfect. We could walk to the centre of St Helier, but there was also a shuttle three times each morning. It's just far enough away to be quiet. The spa was excellent and the various pools were well kept and quiet during our time here. The breakfast offered a lot of fresh choice and the staff were very accommodating. We had a double room with a balcony, which offered a lounge area and was perfect for evenings in, if we wanted. The room was well decorated and very clean and offered air conditioning and tea making facilities."
5209,Hotel de France,"We’ve been visiting Hotel de France for many years and it has been our favourite hotel in Jersey. We’ve given many 5 star reviews over the years, but unfortunately this visit has been disappointing. The room is just as lovely as ever and so are the staff. However on this occasion it has been spoilt by a large gang of fellow residents. It started on the Friday night, where they got hammered in the bar. The fire alarm went off at 2am which was probably down to them smoking in one of the rooms. Normally on a Saturday morning we would enjoy a lovely relaxing time in the pool/spa area, but this time it was really spoilt by this rowdy group. They completely took over the whole pool area with shouting, screaming kids, bombing in the pool and turning the lovely spa into a horrible…"
5210,Hotel de France,"A wonderful experience at the Hotel de France. Stayed in a Spa Room which was so spacious with a large luxurious bathroom and immaculately clean. The fantastic balcony overlooking St Helier was great for enjoying the afternoon sunshine. All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, especially Trey and Jessica who were so understanding and proactive in assisting with a medical issue, so grateful for their help. Breakfast options were plentiful and all of a high standard. The restaurant offers a good menu choice and enjoyed delicious meals there on two evenings - a perfect place to enjoy the beautiful sunsets. Highly recommend the wonderful hotel pool and gym facilities which I enjoyed everyday. The walk into town took about 12 minutes and was perfectly pleasant, there is…"
5211,Hotel de France,"My wife and I spent a week here in September. All the reception staff were very helpful, especially Julie who was on duty when we arrived. All were prepared to book restaurants for us for our evening meals. All the staff were happy and smiling. The hotel runs an infrequent shuttle bus to the centre of St Helier but it is only a 20 minute walk down and there are three bus routes that pass the front of the hotel. The two lifts are small and it is clearly pointed out – Covid has not gone away – that members of different households should not share the lifts. We had a good size room, with plenty of wardrobe and drawer space, and a very simple to use safe. It had a large table and three chairs, two fan heaters, a proper hairdryer and a large TV with English French and German…"
5212,Hotel de France,"We would personally like to thank “ Issac, Harriet,Sarah, Monica & chloe” you made our stay complete. You were all attentive,caring,professional and truly went above and beyond. I could not fault this hotel or its staff and facilities. Even on our wedding day and we were treated like kings and queens and made to feel so special. Quite simply your amazing and thank you 😊"
5213,Hotel de France,Let me start with the good bit. The breakfast staff were excellent especially Monica. And now for the rest of it. The room was dated and very small for that price. It was located oddly very far away from the other even numbered rooms. The reception often sent us up the wrong direction. The shower controls were so stiff we couldn't even open them and struggled. It was obvious this was not looked at each time a new resident came. It should have been done. We had to request reception to sort it out which they did. The worst bit is the climb up to the hotel. That slope is very badly broken up and not ideal for the elderly who seem to be the majority of residents who choose this hotel. That slope is a falls risk. There is a lump of tarmac jutting out at the entrance to the…
5214,Hotel de France,"The outside of the building is impressive as is the reception area. We were welcomed warmly by the staff and did indeed found that every member of staff that we encountered were very helpful.and friendly. We had a spa room which did not disappoint. It was bright and large with a balcony.,super king size bed and a large well appointed shower room. We were pleased that the safe was free and there was a fridge and refreshments. It was a special anniversary for us and we were delighted with the gifts and card the hotel kindly left for us. Our room like the rest of the hotel was spotlessly clean. The swimming pool area was a relaxing and beautiful calm area. Breakfast was a continental style with a few additions but a bigger choice at an additional cost. We found that what was…"
5215,Hotel de France,"Went to the hotel for lunch while we were staying in Jersey. We booked there as it was where we honeymooned 32 years ago. The staff were initially attentive, however this did not last. We received our food and that was the last time any member of staff spoke to us, no condiments offered, no further drinks or desserts. We had to ask for the bill which took ages to arrive then had to go up to the bar to pay as nobody came over to take our payment. The restaurant was not busy only four other tables eating. The food was mediocre and overpriced, overall a very disappointing experience"
5216,Hotel de France,"Stayed for a long weekend for our wedding anniversary and I have to say it was superb. Great room in what I think was the older part of the hotel - modern decoration and completely immaculate in terms of cleanliness. Top floor with fantastic views across St Helier. Breakfast was very good and we ate dinner in the restaurant on the first night which again was excellent. Perfectly cooked steaks, a bottle of wine, and sat at an outdoor table with a view - could not of wished for anything better. We even had a bottle of fizz and some chocs in the room along with a handwritten card because it was our anniversary. Total surprise and a really nice touch. I didn't mention it was our anniversary when I booked the room but only when I later booked the table for dinner - really…"
5217,Hotel de France,"Beautiful hotel, lovely staff - so helpful & kind. Spa room was fantastic with views looking down to St Hellier town. The hotel has lots to offer, beautiful gardens, sun terrace, pool, hydropower pool etc & spa area. Mix of modern & traditional decor"
5218,Hotel de France,"Stayed here with my parents, husband and sons was a brilliant hotel with pleasant and helpful staff . Rooms were lovely and clean . Breakfast was well organised with plenty of choice for everyone. Swimming pool and spa area very clean. Would definitely recommend"
5219,Hotel de France,Just back from 3 days at Hotel de France and really enjoyed it. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Room very clean and had all you need for a city break hotel. Good location with a 15 mins walk into town. Swimming pool was lovely. Ate one night in the restaurant and really enjoyed it. Included breakfast was plentiful and also options for extras. Would definitely stay here again.
5220,Hotel de France,"Firstly we must address that the exterior of the hotel is absolutely stunning, interior could do with some updating. The spa is equally as beautiful, and kept Uber clean. Unfortunately we had some issues the first evening with some loud music coming from one of the rooms. It was reported to reception and we were given a credit on our room which we used at the hotels restaurant.The restaurant served lovely food to a high standard however the service was slightly slow due to the busyness of the hotel.However the staff at the restaurant and throughout the hotel were fantastic throughout our stay. Special shout out to Hattie!!! I would highly advise staying at this hotel although slightly out of the centre it’s definitely worth spending a few days here."
5221,Hotel de France,"Pros: -Decent location a walk away from the city centre (10mins) -Very secluded and quiet -Beautiful gardens and grass to relax in -Wonderful old-fashioned and relaxed atmosphere -Professional and friendly staff -Amazing spa and pool -Breakfast buffet was delicious and had a lot of choice -Amenities were well-stocked in the room -Great value for money, but you still pay a premium Cons: -Room was small and dated -Super tacky restaurant design was straight out of 1978"
5222,Hotel de France,Lovely looking gardens as you arrive at the hotel some 20 walk from the town centre. The reception staff were friendly and attentive as were all the staff. The main facilities include an attractive dining area spa and swimming pool. The breakfasts were good and the evening meals not included in the price were good but expensive compared to eating out in the town. Our weeks stay on the fifth floor was over £1300 for bed and breakfast. Only one small lift was available all week so there was often a wait . The room didn’t have a mini bar to keep drinks cool and the room was like an oven The fan simply recirculated hot air. The room itself was tired and needs upgrading.
5223,Hotel de France,"I may be easily pleased but I found HdF a most relaxing and enjoyable hotel to stay in. Yes, it might be a tad pricey but my overall experience was good. Staff - All staff I encountered were friendly and courteous. The servers at the Terrasse restaurant we’re happy to chat but we’re not intrusive. Facilities - Our room had been refurbished recently and was comfortable and impeccably clean - we had two visits from the House Manager to check that it had been cleaned to his satisfaction. I watched him check the toilet and waste bins and scrutinies the room in general. Shuttle Bus - Maybe this could run a little more often, but it is a much appreciated service as a taxi cost £7.50 one-way. Restaurant - The dinner menu is a little restricted but provided more than enough choice…"
5224,Hotel de France,"What a lovely hotel.Everything was spotlessly clean.The staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was delicious and had lots to offer. By far the best part though was the pool and spa area.A large pool,jacuzzi,steam room,sauna and warm and cold plunge pools were all beautiful with loungers provided to relax when the weather isn't great and loungers in the garden for when it's nice.All in all a fabulous place to stay and my friend and I will definitely be back."
5225,Hotel de France,"We have just returned from a wonderful, relaxing holiday at this gorgeous hotel. All staff are friendly, attentive and hard working, nothing was too much trouble. We had a double room in the newer, spa section and the room was spotlessly clean, spacious and comfortable, really cannot fault it. Another person we travelled with had a single room in the older part of the hotel and felt like their room was a little cramped, with no view and smelt strongly of bleach on arrival, it was quite a juxtaposition to the newer room, still clean and comfortable but didn’t have the same wow factor. We all thought breakfast was great, plenty to chose from and no big queues for things. The restaurant area is lovely and the evening menu was fantastic, we ate there on 2 occasions. I hired a…"
5226,Hotel de France,Great facilities and friendly staff. We booked a spa room with balcony and it was very spacious and modern. The small fridge was really useful and the efficient and quiet aircon was very handy. The pool area in the spa itself was gorgeous. Only downside was the hotel’s location in St Helier. You can walk into town from there but it’s not the most scenic of routes.
5227,Hotel de France,"I do not like to give a negative review on here without first addressing my concerns with management. I have addressed my concerns and still feel not enough was done to alleviate my concerns. I did not enjoy my stay here...yet did love St Helier and indeed Jersey. The hotel is 20 years out of date and even the new sections are decorated in beige leather sofas and dark brown leather tub chairs. The main building is stuffy, smelly and the decor from the 90s. Who has carpet on the walls? Staff are either fabulous (2 stand out) or completely ambivalent or as the main issue seems to be...absent! They have a £5 surcharge for every room service xall...when we enquired about this, we were told ot was due to being understaffed. I am happy to pay for room service, but £5 per call in a…"
5228,Hotel de France,"Stayed many times since opening, just gets better. With the current situation in the industry re lack of staff, it is brilliant to see that the Cornwall has adopted a strategy of training young local talented children. Under the watchful eye of Mark, Restaurant Manager, he is giving a wonderful training to these young staff and setting them on a career path. There attention to detail and there wish to please is a breath of fresh air in todays world. Cannot get better than this."
5229,Hotel de France,"This is a great hotel. The hotel, rooms & spa are all very clean & well maintained. All of the staff we spoke to were polite, friendly & helpful. The hotel is large but also peaceful & relaxing. We had a 3 night stay & had dinner in the hotel which was very nice. The breakfast was equally as good, it’s self service buffet style but with a very wide choice. The spa is fantastic facility and well worth visiting. The hotel is located away from the main centre of St Helier being a 25 minute walk away. Highly recommended."
5230,Hotel de France,Everything was prefect from check in to departure. Staff were very helpful and friendly. The buffet breakfast had an excellent choice. The bar are and outside seating area provided great views across St Helier. Great spa facilities and pool. Well worth a visit and we would love to go back.
5231,Hotel de France,"On arrival, the reception staff were welcoming and friendly, being happy to help from calling taxis, answering enquiries and support with luggage. Our was a twin classic room. It was big enough for 2 of us, with a safe, larger wardrobe, tea and coffee facilities, clean bathroom, and a Dyson fan (which were for grateful for due to hot weather). Housekeeping staff cleaned our room everyday and changed towels. For our meal on the night, we asked a kind waitress about my mams gluten free diet due to her being a coeliac. She let all her staff know this and on breakfast the next morning my mam was offered gluten free cereals, grandpa, porridge, sausages and hash browns freshly made. The breakfast options were delightful, a range of fruit segments, breads, cheeses, granola, Jersey…"
5232,Hotel de France,"My wife Tracey and I (Mick) stayed at this hotel for 12 nights in June. It was a wonderful experience as the hotel is like a period film set and the whole experience of staying there was made special by it's settings, grounds, rooms and food, plus drinks. The rooms were spacious and very clean, they were serviced to a high standard every day. There is a good selection of drinks in the two bars and food choice was excellent. My wife has to follow a gluten free vegetarian diet and this provided no problem to the hotel's chefs to deliver her constant delicious food choices. The whole experience at the hotel was made even more special by its very friendly and professional staff. Nothing was a problem for them. They are a credit to the establishment. One member of staff stood…"
5233,Hotel de France,"Stayed as a couple here recently on B&B. Facilities of the hotel, room and general staff service were all very good. The weakness of the hotel was the restaurant - in two aspects: 1. The menu was OK, albeit with some odd food combinations. However the main problem was that it never changed. 2. Breakfast was unfortunately a chaotic shambles of self service - the usual predictable problems occurring: - Luke warm food with cold plates provided - Food running out - Hot drinks from self-service from machines - queues forming very common; hot water for tea but no teapot so had to fiddle around with tea bags in cups - Toaster not automatic so if the queue at the drinks machine was long the result was burnt toast- literally Sorry management, but this standard is totally…"
5234,Hotel de France,"The best thing was the spa. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful. Rooms on the fifth floor were unbearably hot, despite having a dyson fan running all the time. Shuttle bus only available at certain times and didn’t even run late enough to take us down to town for the evening."
5235,Hotel de France,"Nicely located about a 10 min walk out of town, exciting food and comfortable rooms. The spa rooms are modern and a restful place to be with a small balcony. Spa treatments are in high demand, best to book."
5236,Hotel de France,"Lovely hotel with excellent staff from housekeeping, through restaurant, reception to management. Nothing was any trouble for anyone. The help I received when my mother was taken ill, was exceptional. Food was good (yes agree not full English breakfast but I didn't starve: there was plenty to choose from and keep you going!!!) The only downside is the location - well out of town and a very steep incline to get up. It really isn't suitable for anyone with slight mobility issues and definitely should be hightlighted."
5237,Hotel de France,"Just finished a fab 5 day stay at Hotel de France. Particular mention of two staff. Lauren (dining - waitress) who smiles the whole time, very friendly. Dean (barman) who works his socks off all day and still manages to have a sense of humour particularly around some of the older more fussy clientele. Reception checking in was quick and straightforward. Room on 2nd floor (spa side). Spacious and clean. Pool was lovely, towels supplied and then lying out in the garden after. Gym is free too and we had the whole place too ourselves (free weights and machines). Dinner and breakfast was great. Don't understand comments about breakfast which was plentiful and fine, catering for all. All in all a great stay."
5238,Hotel de France,What really beautiful hotel the only reason why I think about five stars is that I asked for champagne and I'll room on arrival and it wasn't there and it kind of ruined experience as if someone's perfect close to me hopefully next time we get to visit never get it right but I would definitely go back
5239,Hotel de France,"We recently returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel de france and I must say, this is a beautiful hotel with loads of facilities. The grounds are well maintained and clean and the hotel entrance in grand but welcoming with a homely feel. We arrived a few hours before our check in time as we had planned to leave our luggage and return later. We had messaged earlier and asked if this was OK, which it was however they did say they would make every effort for our room to be available o our arrival, and it was. Check in should have been at 1500hrs however we was in out room at 0930hrs The rooms are not overly big but are big enough to enjoy your stay. Plenty of hanging space, trouser press, safe, tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was again not massive but had everything…"
5240,Hotel de France,"Stayed at the hotel while attending the Jersey International Motoring Festival. The location was central to town. The food wonderful. The staff very attentive. The swimming pools and spas were fabulous, just what you needed after a long day. Looking forward to our next visit. Thank you for looking after us (brits wearing Union Jack outfits)"
5241,Hotel de France,"we have been to Jersey many times but never stopped here before, what a little gem we have missed. Just spent 3 wonderful days here- the hotel is lovely, very clean and rooms modern, although the grandeur of the older parts of the hotel are still there. We had a standard room but were not disappointed, it was very clean, modern and tastefully decorated The restaurant and bar area were great, food excellent, surroundings lovely and prices not too expensive. One of the major strengths of this hotel is their amazing staff, very helpful, friendly and efficient, nothing seemed too much trouble for anyone. Dont be put off by the access to the hotel, its hidden behind a medical centre, its a beautiful place"
5242,Hotel de France,"We visited this hotel for our 25th wedding anniversary. We stayed in a spa room with a balcony which was lovely, very spacious with a king size comfy bed, little sofa and coffee table and nice furniture on the balcony. There was a huge bathroom with large bath and shower and complimentary toiletries. On arrival we were surprised to find a bottle of prosecco, a fruit basket and a card wishing us a happy anniversary and a lovely stay, thoughtful. The spa area is gorgeous, there is a pool, jacuzzi, ice cold plunge pool, warm pool,sauna and steam room, loungers, showers and pleasant changing rooms. We booked three different treatments over the course of the week and I would thoroughly recommend them, the staff were attentive and professional. We also used the gym taking part in a…"
5243,Hotel de France,"We thought the hotel was very smart. The room was spacious and comfortable with very sunny balcony. The bathroom was very modern with an excellent shower and decent toiletries. I cannot quite understand the moaning of previous guests regarding the breakfast offering and having to pay extra for a “full English”. The scrambled egg, sausage, bacon, tomatoes and toast is surely sufficient, plus all the pastries, etc. in addition? If the bowls of fruit are ‘too small” then take more than one! The restaurant evening meals offered a reasonable choice at prices similar to outside restaurants in Jersey. We had a nice afternoon tea also. The staff were very friendly and efficient but I feel the dining area seemed a bit understaffed as service was slow. Our dish of butter for the afternoon…"
5244,Hotel de France,"Hotel looks like a 4star but doesn’t live up to it, stayed for 4 days with friend and paid over £700 for a twin room for bed & breakfast, for that price I would have expected a full English to be offered for free, £5 extra seems excessive! Room rather small, lack of tourist information in room, unhelpful spa/pool staff and grumpy bar manage!! Curtsey bus not available Other staff lovely"
5245,Hotel de France,"Have wanted to stay here for many years. Sadly the outlook from/to the hotel has changed with a carbuncle having been built in front of it. Notwithstanding that the hotel is very nice, staff are professional and courteous, main meals in the restaurant are good and the Spa facilities are very good. Issue is the breakfast which is embarrassing for a hotel of this quality, 100% self service, limited choice and the buffet options of bacon, sausage and scrambled egg were, at times, inedible. The one reason why I wouldn't stay here again, which is a shame."
5246,Hotel de France,"Lovely hotel, spacious rooms & big comfortable beds. Ace spa, pool & gym. Friendly attentive staff.Treat yourself to the seasonal taster menu. Fantastic! Even better with the paired wine suggestion. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5247,Hotel de France,"Stayed for 4 nights in a nice spa room with good view and small balcony. Nice welcome at reception upon arrival. However we felt the hotel is let down by a poor breakfast. Only warm items with cold plates are bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs. The same every morning. You have to ask for porridge and wait up to 15 minutes for to arrive. The smallest fruit bowls I have ever seen! Self serve tea/coffee from a machine is not what we would expect from such a hotel. My wife asked on first morning if any gluten free sausages were available. The assistant said she would check but 4 mornings later and still no response. Very poor."
5248,Hotel de France,"Stayed for four nights at this beautiful hotel and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. Checked in late on a Thursday and staff were on hand to help providing plenty of information regarding the amenities and breakfast. A handy 20 minute drive from the airport and a short 15 minute walk to St Helier town. There are buses that run past the hotel that also go into the town and I got one going the other way to Gorey and Jersey Zoo. The hotel itself is very easy to navigate with a fantastic restaurant serving buffet style breakfast, afternoon tea and dinner. Had the tasting menu on one night with 6 courses and some of the most exquisite food. A mix of meat, fish and a light and airy soufflé to finish. The hotel has a spa which is free to use for hotel guests and comes with a main pool,…"
5249,Hotel de France,"Stayed here for a week recently.....very pleased with the standards in the hotel.....we had a spa room which was pretty new and was huge It had a balcony and views over the town towards the sea.We found the quality and choice of food excellent and all the staff(especially Sarah in the restaurant) were friendly and helpful. The hotel was fairly difficult to find.....I think we found a different route every day,and we would imagine parking could be a problem in busier months.Apart from that,the swimming pool was lovely and we enjoyed our stay."
5250,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We booked a table for dinner last night and the food was excellent. Soufflé to start, then we had Monkfish with mussels , fish and chips, Chicken Schnitzel and Lamb- all excellent. We were served by Kate and had excellent service. Good to see the dining room busy and the hotel reception area looked nice too. Would recommend and we will be back."
5251,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,Just returned from a nights stay at Huntingtower. I have to mention the staff we met were just so happy and smiling - not to mention very helpful too. The bedroom so spacious and the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on in hotels. Dinner was very good (soup could have been thicker) fish was so fresh and tasty. Mushroom Stroganoff very delicious. Hubby and I just loved our short stay. Really must get back again soon! Thanks to all.
5252,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Just back from 2 nights at the Huntingtower hotel. Reading some of the recent reviews has genuinely made me check my booking details as they are poles apart from my experience. One recent review describing the hotel as having the ‘wow’ factor - I mean the only thing that ‘wowed’ me was just how foisty the shower curtain smelt! The bedroom was dirty, the light shade with a translucent bottom lit up the dead flies within it directly above the bed. The bathroom door was filthy, black finger prints on the white paintwork - obviously hadn’t been cleaned or painted for years. The string to pull the bathroom light on / off I think was originally white but was now a dirty brown / black colour. Cobwebs dangling from the ceiling in more than one area of the room, a rip in the worn…"
5253,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Just home from a 2 night stay at this beautiful hotel. It certainly gave us the wow factor. We booked a superior king room with sofa. It was spotlessly clean, very spacious, extremely comfortable bed, and provided everything we needed. We were welcomed by reception staff, they were all so friendly and that applies to every member of staff we met. Such a beautiful setting. We actually contemplated staying longer. Breakfast provided a huge choice of hot and cold choices, catering for every need. We cannot wait to return. Thanks to everyone for making this an enjoyable experience for us."
5254,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Within a short distance from Glasgow , this hotel was ideal for a short break in a quiet location but near Perth for shopping and looking around. The room when we arrived was not ready but we didn't mind and had a couple of drinks in the bar as we waited. The receptionist and bar staff was very good and the bar area was lovely. The receptionist came to get us when the room was ready, but we could have happily sat for a good while. The room was lovely, huge bed and sofa bed. The toilet was ok, only 2 glasses for 3 of us and half a loo roll. Tea and coffee was nice but again only facilities for 2- we were 3 so that was a shame. I know if we really needed these facilities the reception staff would have been very efficient and sorted this for us. This was not a problem and we…"
5255,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Had our Christmas family night away here at the end of December. Perfect choice for a great meal, lovely cocktails and a overnight stay. ALL staff were lovely, welcoming and efficient. Bed breakfast and dinner deal amazing, plus room upgrade free of charge. Beautiful wood panelled dining room. Although bedrooms were as warm as you wanted them the 'only' downside was the public areas were a bit cool and the fire not lit which would have been nice. It was -5 outside so normally maybe ok. Wouldn't stop us going back again though as all 6 of us really enjoyed the hotel."
5256,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,Terrible hotel that doesn’t except legal tender !!!! Correct me if I’m wrong but cash is still legal tender but according to this hotel they have decided it doesn’t apply to them !! These hotels do not deserve customers and are in charge of there own demise and I for one will not shed a tear !!!
5257,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Stayed 3 nights. We found the room to be very spacious spacious, food very good had meals all 3 evenings. and helpful & friendly staff. Overall it would be difficult to find fault with this hotel. Particular mention to the staff who were always charming and pleasant."
5258,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We stayed for two nights & found everything very good, the staff are so helpful & friendly, we had evening meals both nights & it was lovely we all enjoyed it especially the sea bass , beds very comfortable & spacious, only complaint it was very hot , which I wasn’t expecting but would definitely recommend & visit again"
5259,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Arrived for a 2 night,dinner, bed and breakfast stay at the Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower hotel perth. As always,a warm welcome from reception. Check in was quick and easy. We found our room upstairs, clean and tidy. Bar staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very good, plenty choice and we were sitting in conservatory which was lovely. Evening meal had a good choice, good standard of food. My wife and son both had the venison which was melt in the mouth, really enjoyed it. A big Thank You to Bryony ( assistant manager) and all her hard working staff for helping make our weekend a very enjoyable one. We have visited this hotel many times over the years and never been disappointed. We look forward to our next trip, see you all soon. Kenny & Val"
5260,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"This hotel was great, probably one of our favourite ones from this trip to Scotland. It’s super charming with nice big rooms. The place was very tidy and quiet. There is a restaurant on site. We never went for dinner, but the breakfasts were both very good. All in all a good stay!"
5261,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,1st stay in Scotland and really enjoyed the hotel and the area. The rooms were large and well cleaned and the staff were really lovely and friendly. Have to add Reese who works in the bar was extra lovely and really made us feel welcome. Would definitely come back again and Perth is a very pretty place to visit.
5262,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We had a lovely stay, went for my husbands birthday. All the staff was great, the bar, breakfast and reception staff was very welcoming, breakfast was really nice, room amazing. Looking forward to return for a few days and try the wonderful menu and explore a bit more the hotel and surroundings"
5263,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,The surrounding grounds are quite attractive as is the hotel building. The gathering areas are also welcoming but the room accommodations are variable. Our room was comfortable and well-furnished but not so the room of our traveling companions. I'm basing my review only on our room. The beds were comfortable and everything worked. Had plenty of hot water for a shower and there were complimentary containers of shower products. A hot breakfast was available and there is plenty of parking on the grounds.
5264,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Unfortunately this hotel didn't live upto its expectations. It's a pretty grubby, outdated hotel. There was a lot of visible dust in our room. Not just dust, but the skirting clearly hadn't been wiped for months. The shower wash had been topped up but looked like it's the same bottle that's been used for ages, and it had stuff floating in it so that was a nope from me. Cleaners left someone's rooms tray on the landing we noticed as they were cleaning on our way out, we happened to notice it was still left there (with leftover food on it) when we got back from our day out in the evening. On our first night we had to eat there as it was late. The food is pretty average and way overpriced for what it is. I'd have had a better meal at a whetherspoons. Pretty gutted, felt like we had…"
5265,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Really disappointing room 215 is very small, however described as spacious! Window only opens about 4 inches, kitchen fans on kitchen roof right under window. No fridge in room. Bar last orders at 10.30! Residents then have to leave bar and sit in room outside bar, if they want another drink, it’s call an attendant and more like room service. Doors to outside and locked at 11pm, really hot night with no fresh air. On a positive note breakfast is excellent."
5266,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Stayed overnight on way to Shetland, fantastic place with superb breakfast that set us up for our journey northwards. Will definitely stay again. Parking is easy and despite the heat outside the rooms were exceptionally cool and pleasant, a good nights sleep"
5267,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Positives - beautiful grounds in a rural setting. We had a huge room. Dining room is lovely overlooking gardens and food is exceptionally good. Staff are all friendly with great customer care skills. Negatives - it is located miles from Perth itself, interior is tired and needs refurb. Bathroom very old with shower over bath."
5268,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Just back from a fabulous afternoon at this hotel. We’d booked the conservatory area several months ago for a family lunch for 19. The staff really went above and beyond to give us a fabulous afternoon, allowing us to eat outside given it was so warm, rearranging tables, keeping an eye out for the little ones, cutting up birthday cake etc. The food was good, the decor is pleasant and comfortable, the garden area is lovely. We’ll definitely be back."
5269,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Really appreciated the extra effort we sometimes requested of the staff. We appreciated your getting us a fan on our second night staying there. It would have been more helpful if the fan had more speeds than extra slow. Rooms did not same electric outlets next to lamp tables by bed as it did to other parts of room. Made it so we could not have phones, computers or other medical devices next to our beds. Also, no safes working the rooms. When we arrived, shower/tub had clump of hair and was dirty. Staff cleaned it out on second day after we requested their service. The breakfast staff and food was excellent. Thank you!"
5270,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Great location close to Perth, Scone Palace and good walks. Room was a good size and clean. Restaurant is excellent as is the food. Building would benefit from some to outside. Friendly staff would visit again ."
5271,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,We would revisit just for the food. Top class. Great boutique hotel well situated for Perth and surrounding areas. Some great walks nearby and very close to other attractions. Staff are helpful and friendly.
5272,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Unfortunately this hotel is not as well run as it used to be so won’t be returning. It was clean but there was no heating in any part of the hotel. There was no cleaning of room, fresh towels or replacement of tea and coffee nor clean cups over the two day stay. The young restaurant staff are needing training. Other staff were really nice. Thank you."
5273,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Booked as birthday treat, room was nit clean nor was the seating area in the lounge. Numerous dead flies where on window sills. Cobwebs and dust covered what was supposed to be a superior suite. When this was raised with reception, I was advised that the room would be cleaned this did not happen. Raised it again and was told I would have had to request this when I explained I had I was told no staff where available. Food was of a reasonable standard and staff friendly enough. Hotel and bar do no accept cash as a payment method which I thought was strange. Paid almost £400.00 for two night stay, which I think was over priced for the standard provided. The hotel may have been a 4star many years ago but not now, requires upgrading and overhaul regarding cleanliness. …"
5274,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,Easy access from A9 Parking good clean rooms of good size . great breakfast and dinner. Varied menu. Excellent cheerful and very helpful staff for which nothing is to much trouble . Online check in check out to save time checking in and waiting in a queue to check out.
5275,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Room was ok , window got stuck open, room wasn’t cleaned at all on our 2 night stay, despite complaint to reception twice. We settled for clean towels both nights, that had to be requested from reception. I was told that policy was to hang the “please service the room” sign on the door- but there wasn’t one ! Nor did anyone tell us . Food was pretty bad, chicken in a Club sandwich was off and had to be removed. Full cooked Breakfast was all pre cooked and very bland, none of the 3 of us ate it and opted for continental after first morning. Would certainly not return . Very poor choice of drinks in the bar, haven’t got this, run out of that . Complete lack of attention to any consideration to guests Does not deserve its trip advisor rating."
5276,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We had a lovely time at the Leonardo during our one night stay. The staff was friendly and accommodating throughout our visit, especially those in the restaurant. We highly recommend dinner at the hotel. The plates of our neighbor looked so delicious that we changed our initial order and we're so glad we did. It was delicious!"
5277,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We stayed here for the Scottish Gane Fair and as well as a lovely hotel the staff especially Kate & Emma were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and we had a brilliant stay. |For exa,ple we arrived late due to a delayed flight but they kept the kitchen open so we could have something to eat. Above and beyond !"
5278,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,2 Room and bed big disappointment. Stay here before when it wasn't Leonardo hotel. Standards gone downhill now was a great hotel before and we always looked forward to staying there and great area for walks. Room was OK but bed and tea/coffee making facilities poor also asked Room to be serviced in the morning we returned in the evening and dirty glasses and cups still there only thing I could see that had been done was bed made and towels changed and 2 milk added to tea/coffee tray
5279,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,lovely hotel friendly welcoming staff great restaurant food but unfortunately accident on last night of stay when king bed which was a zipped link type separated and deposited my husband on floor between the 2 halves had to get assistance from staff on duty who ascertained the halves had not been assembled correctly - staff checked husband was OK assisted and remade beds and allowed us to resume our nights sleep but was disappointed that no one checked with us the following morning re my husbands health and on check out when asked if we enjoyed our stay person on duty was unaware of our problem thought we would have had follow up contact from hotel re incident but disappointingly have received none - I can only hope they have reviewed procedures so this doesn't happen to anyone…
5280,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Nice countryside location but sadly a tired looking hotel, inside and out. It really does not fit the description of a boutique hotel. Room was a good size, bed comfy and it was generally pretty quiet even when the hotel was busier. Sadly the decor was very uninspiring. Needed to request extra towels and mug, 2 light bulbs not working and were not replaced. No service to rooms, I have stayed in other hotels who have returned to daily services. Even just emptying the bins, checking the towels and filling up the tea tray would have been welcome. Evening meal was mediocre, but breakfast was nice. Staff were pleasant."
5281,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We stayed recently, thought it would be a lot nicer , it’s not a boutique hotel, it’s very average, tired looking , carpets we’re needing a good hoovering, room was shabby , 2 lights weren’t working, bathroom wasn’t great looking, the evening meal wasn’t great , breakfast was re heated stuff, staff were friendly, nice grounds round the place, plenty parking spaces"
5282,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,A beautiful hotel stayed for 2 nights good food staff were absolutely amazing nothing a problem lovely manner with all the staff from reception to restaurant setting is lovely Interior is welcoming real Scottish feel and hospitality will definitely go back and highly recommend Superior rooms recommended
5283,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Staff were amazing, beds were comfy and breakfast was great! Very good value for money and Perth town centre is just 10 mins away. Will be back for sure. I would highly recommend this hotel for couples, family or friends getaways"
5284,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Disappointing. Hotel was stunning as was the location, but bathroom was tiny (and not properly cleaned). Good could be improved on (think the menu was too broadband would have been better to be smaller but we do enjoy well cooked local food)."
5285,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,Good hotel with friendly staff and great dining. Grounds are ideal on a sunny day and for walks to work up an appetite. Comfortable rooms and bed. DBB deal is amazing for an overnight stay. Dinner options were good and breakfast was excellent.
5286,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Stayed for one night in June. The hotel could do with smartening up on the outside, but inside it was clean and comfortable. The rooms were big and the hotel is dog friendly. Plenty of seating both inside and out. The manageress was very helpful and all the staff were friendly. The food in the restaurant was very good."
5287,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"This was our 2nd time at this hotel in 2 years. It is set in the countryside only a few miles from the City and has ample private car parking. We ended up in the same room probably because we booked with Booking.com again, but it was fine, good beds and clean with all we needed for a comfortable stay. We paid £95.40 which is good for a Hotel in Scotland. Breakfast was great with a fine choice of everything available to set you up for the day. The only thing that struck us as odd was, they pay great attention to warning you in advance about their strict face mask wearing policy in public areas (we received at least 3 messages in advance about this) yet when we got there no one, including staff, were wearing masks. However despite this negative, we would stay here again."
5288,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We loved staying here, the staff could not have been more welcoming or helpful, the hotel has a lovely ambience to it..... wide staircases, tartan carpet, dining areas really welcoming, gardens beautiful and our room (417) was clean, large and comfy. the food was excellent, both evening meal and breakfast and we will most definitely be staying here again. We have a large dog that slept in our car, but the hotel is very dog friendly so we were able to have her with us if we wanted to. It's a short walk to the riverside so perfect for a short dog walk too. Can't fault this hotel, it was perfect for us and great value for money."
5289,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"The hotel was not quite the boutique hotel we'd seen online , it's a little tired and run down . The staff on reception were very nice and we were allocated room 212 . We notice that the stairs up to the room (no lift) were a little dirty and very dusty . Our room was tiny , there were dirty stains on the carpet we did think of going back to reception to ask for a different room but we were in a hurry as we had a meeting in Perth with family members . In the evening when we got back we were shocked to hear the kitchen ventilation system , it was right outside our bedroom window and was very noisy . I went down to reception and was told it would be switched off at 9:00 PM , at 9:30 I went back to reception and was told it would be switched off at 10:00 PM , it came back on again…"
5290,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"The name and photographs portrayed a very different hotel from what we stayed in. The staff are all very friendly. But the hotel itself is tired and run down. It has an unpleasant smell and made me feel queezey. Our room felt like something from Butlins. Nice bed but that’s it. The breakfast was awful too. Bananas were way best their best, the porridge was stodgy and the cooked food obviously reheated. Very poor! I would not go back here!!"
5291,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,Stayed as a single traveller for the second time this year and have to say standards haven’t dropped. Was put up in a lodge with sitting room large bedroom and bathroom with bath and shower. I think a number of the hotel rooms were taken up by guests attending a wedding. Staff as usual were all charming and helpful. Food was again of a very high standard. Breakfast wonderfully freshly prepared and served with a flourish by the friendly waiters/waitresses. Special mention to the girl from Prague who was busy in the bar all day then supervised the evening meals. It was especially busy because of the wedding but she coped admirably as did the rest of the staff. The whole stay was great. Even the weather behaved with wal to wall sunshine throughout. I’ll be back again in September.
5292,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Lovely welcome from the lady at the reception. Then I had this crazy beautiful room with a nice bathroom as well. Loved the castle house, gardens. Also the restrant was very good with great and many options."
5293,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Fantastic location, food & staff. Defo would return - decor a wee bit tired but warmth of folk great. Not operating full wine list and could have better wine - but I am being picky now! Bed comfortable, breakfast was generous and relaxed. Mint grown locally in gin was a fab touch"
5294,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Check in and out was efficient and friendly. In the well appointed restaurant your staff were very efficient, attentive and friendly. The room were clean and very comfortable as expected and our dog was welcomed: Perhaps the provision of a dog bowl in the room could be considered and a wee rug or coloured towel on which to feed the dog. (we used the bath mat and fed her in the bathroom.) all the publica areas were comfortable and cosy where needed with several sitting areas. We appreciated the bar area for a friendly chat with other customers. We had a great stay and hope to return to explore the area which we did not have time for on our last stay. Thank you."
5295,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We would not to single out any member of staff for particular praise, but everyone we came into contact with was friendly, helpful and a credit to the hotel. This is just the sort of hotel that we like, a little bit old fashioned in some ways, but the room was really nice, the bed amazingly comfortable and the food we were served both at breakfast and in the restaurant for our evening meals was well cooked and well presented."
5296,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"I cannot fault any aspect of our stay, it was for my sons wedding, the staff were all friendly and helpful and could not do enough to help you. It made things go smoothly for us, the food was fabulous and many guests said it was the best they had had at a wedding. 100%"
5297,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"We booked this lovely hotel for one night to rest from a driving trip in Scotland. Perth is just 45 mins from the Edinburgh airport. It is a lovely old hotel with a country home feel. We loved the rooms, the food and the outdoor garden for drinks. It has Scottish charm."
5298,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,"Relaxing stay in a large, clean, comfortable room. Friendly, helpful and professional staff. Good choice of food, tasty and well cooked. Only criticism is of the booking system - through Jury's Inn Central Reservations. Lengthy and therefore costly! Seemed to be staffed by untrained, uncertain personnel - I had to phone the next day as the promised confirmation email never arrived. Again put on hold - at a cost of 11p per minute - is this to maximise the charge or are staff really so clueless? Not impressed!!!"
5299,Leonardo Boutique Huntingtower Hotel Perth,Fantastic hotel but out room looked onto a roof it is in such a lovely location and we didn’t get to experience the view and beautiful gardens from our room. Staff in the bar were fantastic however no Guinness on tap. Lovely and quiet had a great nights sleep.
5300,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,We stay at this hotel regularly and it never disappoints! Staff are friendly and efficient! Check in and out is slick both times. Rooms are very comfortable and well equipped! The standard of cleanliness is very high! Highly recommended!
5301,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,Stayed at this hotel numerous times over the last 6 years! It always meets our high expectations! Staff are very friendly and efficient! Accommodation is always very clean and comfortable! Breakfast menu is comprehensive and well presented! Great hotel and first class stay!
5302,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"We booked for 1 night for a family of 4 to celebrate our son's birthday. The room, leisure facilities and breakfast were exceptional. Our room was clean and huge, plenty of space for the kids to run about. The pool and facilities although quite small were great and perfect for us, we were in 3 times during our stay. Breakfast was among the best we've had at a hotel, an absolutely huge choice to cater for everyone. Couldn't recommend enough. Only small downfall would be the price for our dinner in the restaurant. Although the food was good it was a bit pricey. However this is only a small thing that others may disagree with. Overall we had a great time and would definitely return."
5303,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Been staying on and off for a year and all the staffs have been amazing, friendly and polite. Got to know a few of them. All employees at the hotel I spoke to were always polite and cheerful and seem to work hard to make sure the guests were taken care of"
5304,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Grim looking hotel from outside. Instead I was pleasantly surprised, lovely interior. Food in evening and morning was shocking awful. Looks like staff in restaurant and bar are there just to take a paycheck. No real interest in customers."
5305,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Soon as we got taken to our table in the restaurant, the waitress asked us what we liked to drink. We haven't even sat down yet, and was a bit awkward to hurridly choose a drink while she looked a bit under pressure to hurry us up. When we asked for a minute to choose our meals, the waitress didn't come back. We had to ask someone else who was passing our table. Food came out super fast, my friend was a bit sceptical on the speed, he ordered roast chicken, and realised it was pre made / re-heated etc. My beef in the pie was a bit dry. Eggs at breakfast where obviously from powder form. I understand hotels use powder form, but this had little taste compared to other hotels. Older lady at breakfast was super helpful. The young gentleman at the buffet seemed super attentive…"
5306,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"The Altens Hotel is easily located, has a large car park, and one receives a very friendly and efficient welcome. The room was pristine, very comfy bed and the shower was superb. When one went to the restaurant the friendly member(s) of staff led one to the reserved table promptly and the service and presentation of the tasty food was very good."
5307,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"We had a 2 night stay and found it really enjoyable, with a clean comfortable room and an excellent breakfast. We were aware that the hotel has leisure facilities and although we did not use them this time, we did scope them out for future reference and the gym facility looks great."
5308,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Nice location if you have a car, family friendly, staff very friendly and was so nice to have the swimming pool. Even thought the small kids pool was very cold. Kids enjoyed it. Staff every relaxed with kids."
5309,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,Had a lovely stay with husband and kids. Would definitely recommend to others. We will definitely be back. Kids loved the pool and steam room. Beds were super comfy and big. Breakfast was nice with a good choice for everyone.
5310,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Stayed one night at the Altesn Hotel, have stayed here on numerous occasions & as usual, had a perfect experience. room & facilities are exceptional at a very reasonable price. have booked a 2 night stay in May, would highly recommend."
5311,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,Cold reception staff. Poor quality breakfast. Hard bed. Swimming pool only redeeming feature. Car needed to access city centre. Overall it looked good at first but it didn’t live up to appearances or cost.
5312,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"My wife and i attended a birthday party at the Altens Hotel last weekend. We stayed for two nights. The rooms were very comfortable and well decorated. The food was first class with absolutely no complaints at all. The staff in the restaurant could not have been more helpful. One young man, Liam, really entertained us all whilst taking our drinks order. Very witty and obviously good at his job. We will definitely be back for a weekend break."
5313,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Exceptional hotel stay. Indoor beautiful pool for swimming, room was spacious, nice deep bathtub with very good water pressure shower. But the breakfast….oh my goodness! This buffet has everything you could want for breakfast. It was fantastic!! We loved our stay here."
5314,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Good location, decent price but leisure facilities are the downfall to the hotel. Changing rooms are outdated and not clean. Water and marble are a massive hazard. The pool was always full with no booking system in place."
5315,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Great clean hotel with brilliant facilities for all the families to use. Good comfortable beds that you get a great nights sleep. Hotel is very handy for town and most of all for us to meet up with family. Great parking and free, plenty of spaces to leave your car without worrying about it. Will return soon."
5316,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,£680 plus! for 6 days for 2 with 4 days breakfast for 1. And no housekeeping over those days. Breakfast staff excellent as was receptionists but no housekeeping to rooms I'll assume you have to request this or when I worked in hotels 40 plus years ago was done daily for towel changes etc.
5317,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Aberdeen Altens is a hotel located on the outskirts of the city. It has acres of free parking, is quiet, comfortable, clean and serves good food. I have stayed here numerous time’s basically for it’s location which suits me. It’s reasonable priced and the staff are very professional. I would recommend a stay at Altens at any time of the year"
5318,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Good hotel for break away. Bus stop nearby for Aberdeen . Good rooms, comfortable bed and chairs. Nice restaurant. Good breakfast. Can ask for porridge or poached or fried eggs. Meals nice throughout the day. Leisure suite good. Can be busy at times."
5319,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Don’t be put off by the gray imposing facade on the outside. Inside it’s a great value hotel with excellent food. Reasonably priced menu for a hotel. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Got a good nights sleep. Use of leisure facilities and breakfast was included in our rate, great value. Dry varied buffet breakfast choices to suit all tastes."
5320,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,Hotel was clean and tidy. Inside much more modern looking than outside. Swimming pool very small. Restaurant looks great and food amazing! We had evening meal and breakfast. Beds not comfy did not have a great night sleep. But family room great size and plenty of space.
5321,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Hotel has everything a family would need, decent restaurant, comfy rooms, helpful stuff and leisure facilities to boot. Only bad bit is the location which is about a 10 away from the main city centre for some like us this was not a problem. Kids can’t wait to go back (next time we’re in Aberdeen)."
5322,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions. Excellent value for money. Very clean and policy of not servicing your room every day of your stay is a very sensible, sustainable policy. Altens has plenteous parking, a well equipped gym and a nice pool . Staff are welcoming and professional. Buffet breakfast is the highlight with a very wide selection. It is unfortunate the outside of this hotel resembles a multi-storey car park but if you look past that you will be pleased."
5323,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Stayed here on the 1st April, with my 73yr old mum. Our standard room had been upgraded which was a pleasant surprise. Enjoyed the swimming pool and spa. The food was really good, although there were no prices on the menu. The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially when the fire alarm went off at 12.30am. My only con is there was no kettle or tea tray in our room. Looking forward to staying again in the future."
5324,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"The Aberdeen Altens Hotel is very comfortable and clean place to stay. I have enjoyed everyday. The food was good on breakfast, that was the only moment that I've experienced the food in the hotel, and it's a good looking place."
5325,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Impressive hotel on the outskirts of Aberdeen. Great facilities and good sized room, but slightly “tired” feel (maybe that was just my room). Bar restaurant was busy and service was slow, but staff were helpful when I could get their attention. Overall good value."
5326,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"First impression was good room clean and large even though a bit dated, Reception professional and polite, Pool,gym,sauna and steam room good, breakfast good Now the bad side, Bar staff need to be trained properly, Very rude and unprofessional, Would of given 4 stars but was very disappointed Would not recommend this hotel because of this reason, and will not return"
5327,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,Good value and facilities. Plenty staff compared to previous visits but the bar staff need to be better organised and a bit more friendly. Good facilities as ever. Could do to clear room service remains from outside rooms a bit quicker.
5328,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"The Altens Hotel cannot be faulted, absolutely spotless ,fantastic staff , great breakfast , competitive priced restaurant & bar. Very comfortable bed in a comfortable room . We have stayed here more than once & always remembered by the restaurant staff."
5329,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,Meeting held at Altens was planned and executed very efficiently. All arrangements worked very well. Staff welcoming and very helpful. Very good meal served promptly and professionally. A very good participant experience. Thank you.
5330,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Very noisey , lots of foreign nationals standing at enterience smoking in dressing gowns during the day. Staff has no control of children running about. Having dinner in restaurant and people wandering about the bar and restaurant in dressing gowns . Do you not have a dress code ?? Standing at bar drinking in their dressing gown!! Really !!"
5331,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Ideal hotel at a great price, breakfast was really nice with lots of choices. Room was perfectly clean, staff were nice and approachable Swimming pool was enjoyed by both grandparents and grandchildren Plenty of parking places"
5332,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Find another hotel that offers the good old fashioned hotel experience, the hotel is a factory of humans staying, stayed 4 days and room not serviced once, bin filled up and had to ask reception for supplies"
5333,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,The hotel seems to be geared up for oil and gas industry personnel passing through rather than private guests. The eating area is very basic but with hotel pricing. It’s not the sort of place for an intimate meal. The parking is excellent and free.
5334,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"I like this hotel. It looks harsh and almost prisonlike on the outside, but inside it has a nice ambience. The staff are helpful, polite and well trained. The restuarant staff are particularly helpful and efficient. The food is well prepared and tasty."
5335,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,This is the second time we have stayed here in the last year and although our stay was good there is a few slight changes I would make. Perhaps sell a range of confectionary in hotel for midnight snackers.or those with children . Big or Small. How about a range of cocktails at the bar. Just for those not venturing into the city . All the staff are friendly reception and resturant .the restaurant/bar staff put up with some rubbish with great professionalism I have to compliment Ben on reception on both of our stays he has been helpful and friendly. An asset to the hotel . Some of the clientelle need to learn some ettiquette.who brings a takeaway into a hotel resturant.a entire family in PJs at breakfast .Its a pity as its bringing the place down .
5336,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Booked a room last minute with my 12 year old daughter for a night away together we arrived an hour before check in and our room was ready very easy and quick check in. Requested a high floor and we also got that, we used the pool it is small but my daughter had fun by the reviews I was concerned we maybe wouldn’t get the use of it but we did the rooms are a bit old fashioned but they were clean and the bed was comfortable. We also went to the restaurant for a drink and something light to eat the service wasn’t the best as we waited a while to get served while a group of staff were standing chatting at the bar but when we did get served they staff were nice. But overall the hotel is lovely and we would we return if we had something on in Aberdeen."
5337,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"We had a short weekend trip to Aberdeen. Location good, size of room good. Swimming pool was small but a treat for kids. Excellent breakfast and good value, restaurant wasn’t good. Pizza for kids was terrible."
5338,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Only reason I stay here is it is close to work location. The noise on my last visit was not good large group of oil workers banging doors close to midnight and early morning. Quality of sausages at breakfast has changed, they are bot the same as they used to be, very fatty, obviously cheap."
5339,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Ancient furniture, rusty bathroom, heat is controlled with a switch/knob out of the 50s, restaurant is overpriced elementary cafeteria food, and there were clothes in the drawers upon checkin. There's a nice lady at the front desk and another one working in the restaurant, but don't stay there unless the location is very convenient and it's only for a few hours."
5340,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Excellent hotel with amazing facilities. Haven't stayed since before COVID when we were fairly regular visitors. Only regret was that the stay wasn't long enough. We will hopefully be planning to visit again very soon, with any luck for longer this time. Thank you to all staff!"
5341,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Really good value for money, room was huge and bed really comfortable. Shower was great, room was a bit old fashioned but that didnt bother us, close to local shops and shopping centre about 15 mins away. Restuarant was great, staff very lovely and fast service. Food was amazing and massive portions, breakfast was good(lots of options to choose from) highly recommend"
5342,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"We stayed for one night in a family room, room was large with plenty of room for the kids to play. Beds were really comfortable. Breakfast was amazing, had a choice for everybody and tasted great. Was unable to try the pool as it was really busy and we didn't have the time to wait, was told it would be an hour wait and would have missed dinner reservations, plus didnt fancy waiting with a 2 year old! Was a bit surprised at how early the pool closes at the weekend to be honest but will know next time to go a bit earlier."
5343,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Good location and price. Rooms are tidy and clean. Double room with two double beds which was ideal with staying with a 3 year old one. The TV is a bit old fashioned and did not have all channels, not a Smart TV as such, but it was enough for us.pool and steam rooms are good."
5344,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights for a work trip and it was everything I needed for this purpose. Nice comfortable room, great shower and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The quality of food was good too, especially for the evening meal I had. It is a ten-minute drive from the hotel to the city centre, so it's not ideal if you need to travel into town regularly."
5345,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Looks a bit dated from the outside but very nice inside. Enjoyed our stay. Used leisure facilities which were fine. Breakfast choice was good, waitress very attentive. Would definitely stay again. On bus route into city centre too."
5346,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Stayed here during a company course, excellent location within walking distance of course, very clean room, friendly staff, comfy beds, good food, alround a very enjoyable stay, would definitely recommended and will stay here again."
5347,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Nice reception area and large car park however that is where the positives end for this hotel. We were given a room which was at the back of beyond. Although a large room it smelled musty and damp. The bathroom is a weird set up with the sink separate from the rest of the bathroom. Our view was the roof of the hotel. No kettle or coffee making facilities in the room, think this is the first hotel room I’ve ever been in without a kettle. Booked a table for dinner at 6.45 with our children and friends, reception staff assured us that was the earliest table we could get, we have children 3 and 5 so were keen to get food as soon as. Friends checked in after us and managed to book a table for us all at 6.30. Went to the swimming pool at 3.30 it was full. Went up to our room and my…"
5348,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"My wife and I have visited here often and already gave it high praise on Tripadvisor. We decided to take my mum in law for a birthday treat last night and once again it impressed us all. They even layed on a birthday cake, on the house which was a delightful surprise. Top mark Travencore team because you’re worth it."
5349,The Aberdeen Altens Hotel,"Being on a business trip, I chose this hotel because is really close to the place I need to visit, but as a tourist is not ideal. The overall experience is anyway satisfactory, rooms are comfortable and wi fi worked well, at least in the room I was using. The heating system requires improvement/upgrade: it's switched off until you are not in, you cannot set a temperature but only the speed of the fan, which make regulation quite difficult. Personnel is kind and helpful. I didn't use any of the services available apart the restaurant which is nice. I'm quite surprised about the fact that daily room clean up need to be requested, personally I would expect that a basic service is carried out by default (such as bed make up, carpet draw), while accurate clean up (with towels change…"
5350,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Chose this hotel for the location, London EC3 and it's very reasonable price. We're were delighted to find it was better than we expected. We only stayed one night, wish it could have been longer. Sraff friendly and helpful. 15% discount on food and drinks for residents. Excellent service all round."
5351,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Great location to access the tube. Large modern bedroom and bathroom . Excellent breakfast and very friendly staff. Take care if arriving late , we checked in but the room was not ready, so left bag and was assured the reception was open 24 hrs. Arrived back at 11.45pm to find all doors locked and no-one visible so could not get in , fortunately other guests arrived shortly after so we could at least get in the building, make sure you have the 24hr phone number in case of issues."
5352,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Really excellent value hotel in The City. Friendly, helpful staff. Clean modern style rooms with a great coffee pod machine. Great soundproofing. Traditional London pub with draft Pride and ESB. Excellent breakfast included - buffet and/or hot served. Best Bircher Muesli since SZ and Smashed Avocado since NZ! Thank you Fullers!"
5353,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Lovely staff and food excellent nice bar area. Room was comfortable plenty of pillows and cushions coffee machine,kettle ( with a few chocolates and a hairdryer provided as well if lots of nice touches including toiletries razor vanity kit shower caps shoe shine sponge etc.but terrible lighting and awful view of fire escape from the window Room 116. There was a one inch gap under the bedroom door so noisy and letting light in all night. On the downside the milk wasn’t replenished and my muslin cloths were taken with the towels. The bathrooms are in need of some talc and not designed for anyone with a disability. The hotel gives a code for 20% off future direct bookings but it’s cheaper to book via booking.com in our experience. We would stay again."
5354,The Chamberlain Hotel,"lovely hotel nice sized room with a balcony terrace area that would be lovely in summer. There was a really comfy bed and the best breakfast i have ever had a hotel in the restaurant Great location close to tower bridge, the shard etc ."
5355,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Disappointing stay. My room was dark and depressing. A strong smell of shake n’ vac and a pubic hair in the sink. Electricity on the bedside walls didn’t work so couldn’t charge my phone, TV had no signal. When I mentioned this no one seemed to be bothered. Breakfast was not great. But staff did seem friendly. On the plus side bed clean and comfy. But that’s it. I won’t stay here again."
5356,The Chamberlain Hotel,"This hotel is outstanding. We told them we were coming for our anniversary and they decorated the room for us!! We were blown away and it made our day. The food was equally great, lunch was delicious and the breakfast was 10/10! We will definitely come back, location very convenient to local attractions and parking around the corner. Thank you for making our stay extra special."
5357,The Chamberlain Hotel,I booked a room for this Saturday using through booking.com but was contacted by the hotel to say the card I had used couldn’t be charged so I explained I had lost my debit card but would still be checking In Saturday afternoon etc - I got a response to say great see you Sat!! I’ve gone on to my booking.com account this morning to on the total off chance to see a message saying they had cancelled my booking as I hadn’t paid the pre paid room rate and I was given the wrong information!! We are travelling into London today for my wife’s birthday and luckily London isn’t busy so I’ve been able to secure another hotel!! I have never ever received such poor and lazy customer service in my life it’s a total joke!! We use the hotel a lot for clients and events we won’t be anymore! …
5358,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Generous size bedroom with a roof terrace that was more than we could have imagined. The room was hot but a Dyson fan was provided in the room. Water was put in the fridge everyday along with tea and coffee. We also had complimentary toiletries such as toothpaste, shaving cream and a razor. The room also had an ironing board and an iron. Very modern interiors. The breakfast was plentiful and very tasty. Good cold buffet and hot cooked breakfast could be ordered too (included in booking). Staff were helpful and accommodating. Luggage storage is available after checkout on your last day so you can go and explore the city some more."
5359,The Chamberlain Hotel,"The Chamberlain is one of Fuller's brewery hotels and provides really good quality accommodation in the city at an excellent price. It is minutes away from Aldgate tube station and then you are minutes away from the Tower of London etc The decor in the room and the public areas is lovely and the extra little touches (coffee machine and mini fridge in the room, beautiful toiletries in the bathroom) were unexpected. The shower was by far the best I've had in a hotel for quite some time and bath sheets were provided, not the miserable little towels that are more usual. The bed was comfy and the room very quiet. The breakfast offer was very good, plenty of choice and served in the restaurant by the bar. Hotel guests get 15% discount on drinks and food in the pub. We were very…"
5360,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Hotel is really close to Tower Hill and Aldgate tube station so very easy for getting about. It is decorated very nicely and the rooms are beautiful. Our room was a decent size, bed was large (King size) and the room had good amenities: toiletries included/nespresso machine/kettle/hair dryer/iron etc. Mini fridge included also with bottled water and milk (UHT milk though which was a shame). Room was also very quiet and we weren't disturbed by any noise, and the hotel has lifts so easy to get around with luggage. Only 2 things which could have been improved: the site said that there should have been bath robes but I don't think our room had any. Also the room was a little cold and we couldn't figure out how to use the thermostat for heating- I think this only controls air…"
5361,The Chamberlain Hotel,Cannot fault this hotel Staff very polite and professional ... Room amazing Wonderful surprise and decorated the room for wife birthday 100% stay again Breakfast good Hotel very clean ..15% of pub next door
5362,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Lovely hotel with friendly staff, the room was perfect for our needs and a lovely big shower. The adjoining pub was very good and you received 15% off your bill by staying at the hotel, the breakfast included was very nice with friendly staff. Location wise it was fantastic and we would definitely stay here again"
5363,The Chamberlain Hotel,"For London, a really spacious room. Bathroom was a bit tired but fine. Nice decorated bedroom and comfortable bed. Fantastic location which is what most people look for for London. Close to underground stations and a lovely walk across the tower bridge. Breakfast offered lots of choice but we were disappointed with the actual food. I ordered the salmon which they didn’t have and so we both had a full English. The beans and sausage were both Luke warm and our eggs were runny whites. The staff were helpful. Funny smell in the corridors but as this didn’t extend to the rooms it didn’t cause us a problem"
5364,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Great location but very under staffed and the ones there are seemingly young and inexperienced. We had a room with a balcony on the 5th Floor. It was nice but directly opposite student accommodation that you can see directly in to. Room was clean but coffee machine didn’t work. Shower was ok but bathroom was tired in places. Fresh towels during our 2 night stay. Breakfast mediocre. Understaffed and no welcome. We, and others weren’t sure what to do in the morning. It’s mostly self service. Coffee machine wasn’t working. Tea tasted weird. The English breakfast felt like it had been heated up. The second day we had avocado on toast with poached egg. Very strong taste int he smashed avocado, not enjoyable. Was very cheap. Staff had no clue. I’m sure there are nicer places to…"
5365,The Chamberlain Hotel,"The Chamberlain is reasonably priced hotel in the Financial district of London. Very close to Aldgate station, and short walk to the London bridge and Tower of London. The hotel is in a quieter part of the city which was safe and peaceful. The rooms are small but well maintained. The pub on the ground level was great. Good beer and highly recommend the fish and chips. The pub is modern looking and the staff were very friendly. The breakfast was the best part! Continental to start and a menu with at least 5-6 different options included the English breakfast which was tasty and filling. I would stay here again and we enjoyed our 3 night stay."
5366,The Chamberlain Hotel,"This is well run, cosy and central hotel. The staff are super friendly and the breakfast fabulous. So close to the Tower and the river and lots cheaper than those nearby. Front desk staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. Would definitely recommend."
5367,The Chamberlain Hotel,"booked a last minute overnight stay in London as coming up to see sights before queens funeral. Found this at a fantastic compared to many other hotels which were almost double the price. Knowing we were going to be in the hotel awake for about 2 hours out the entire stay didnt need a glitzy and glam 5* Paid to have larger room, not sure we were given that at check in despite receptionist insisting it was, but front desk called back and moved us to larger room...... Room was clean, well appointed, excellent shower and a fab full english breakfast the following morning. Highly recommend this hotel"
5368,The Chamberlain Hotel,"This hotel is beautifully decorated, has friendly and warm staff and the beds and pillows are really really comfortable. Lots of restaurants around and very quiet during sleeping hours. The attached restaurant has very good food, the burger is excellent."
5369,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, our room was spotless and the bed was comfortable. Our stay was impacted by an issue with the air con and although the hotel were unable to rectify it during our stay, the staff worked tirelessly for a fully booked hotel to try their best to get it sorted so it would be unfair to reduce any rating based on this. Breakfast was fantastic with a really good range of hot and cold options. Staff in the hotel are kind and attentive, my experience was they were willing to go the extra mile always this was throughout the booking processes right through to stay and checkout. Would highly recommend this hotel and will be returning when we next visit London"
5370,The Chamberlain Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at the Chamberlain for 3 nights in July (2022). We thought that it was a great hotel and would definitely stay here again. Positives: - The hotel was in a good location - 5 minute walk from Tower Hill Underground and from Tower Bridge / Tower of London. - The room was very comfortable. - The bed was very good and I slept very well (much better than usual when staying in a hotel). - The breakfast was generally good. - All the staff were lovely. - We had the hotel for a decent price - 3 nights bed and breakfast for a total price of £420 (booked via booking.com) Negatives: - One of my pet hates in a hotel room is the lack of plug sockets next to the bed. The plug sockets were the other side of the room, so it was a bit annoying when charging devices. -…"
5371,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Tired room ,the bathroom needs work rotten door mouldy shower tv keeps pixleating.definately not worth the 290 pounds a night, you have to pre book a time slot for your breakfast the night before, haven't had the breakfast yet so cant comment"
5372,The Chamberlain Hotel,A nice hotel but a tad overpriced. The room I stayed in was starting to look tired and could do with some updating. Great tea and coffee making facilities with fresh milk in the fridge which is a nice touch. Very comfortable bed and plenty of fresh towels and nice toiletries. Lovely dining area and a great choice of cooked breakfast and the food quality excellent.
5373,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Please improve breakfast.. we came in December and breakfast was total chaos but food was good. We cane this weekend and hotel again was good, great location but breakfast was not good. Black pudding was inedible, sausage was in edible, bacon was not too my liking as who does streaky bacon for breakfast especially if not crisp. Service was not good and was a lot of people walking around without purpose and coffee machines were broke. If you want people to come back you need to improve and have to have someone responsible for ensuring quality."
5374,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Great value room close to the Tower of London, short walking distance to the underground. Rooms recently updated, quiet area and conformable beds. Breakfast also worthy of a mention. Would stay here again."
5375,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Spent 1 night and choose this hotel due to location and ratings. Great choice. Easy to find from Aldgate or Tower tube stations. Reception staff very friendly and helpful. Let us check in early and allocated a lovely room. Spacious and very comfortable....perfect for a one night stay. Very quiet and great nights sleep. Breakfast included, so great value for money. Staff a bit rushed but good choice and freshly cooked. Would 100% recommend and will definitely use again. Thank you ? Denise ? on reception"
5376,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Really friendly staff, good location , great breakfast. The bedrooms were clean and the bed was comfy but the one we stopped in was looking a little tired. The black furniture has become tatty and makes the room gloomy! The lighting could do with some improvement too around the dressing table. There was a lack of sockets to plug in usb cables too."
5377,The Chamberlain Hotel,We stayed for 1 night last weekend. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was small but lovely and very clean. Coffee machine and complementary water in the fridge. Comfy bed and where we were at the back of the hotel was quiet. Breakfast was tasty. Great location as a base to explore. Only a 5 min walk to the tube. Would stay again.
5378,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Stayed up here for one night. This place is so deceptive because it’s huge. It’s clean, tidy, decorated in light crisp colours. The rooms are spacious and modern with tea/coffee and complimentary water. Breakfast next morning was good. Bit crowded around coffee machine and toaster but hardly a problem. There is a bar downstairs and you get a discount at the bar if you are staying at the hotel. Had a great night’s sleep in a huge clean bed and the room has a proper coffee making machine. Hotel is pretty central to Tower of London, Tower Bridge etc. Staff are friendly and helpful. We arrived early and able to leave our bags there while we went off for a walk."
5379,The Chamberlain Hotel,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Chamberlain Hotel. The property and our room were very clean and smelt lovely and fresh. The room was larger than normal and had all the mod cons needed. The staff were really friendly, helpful and welcoming. We arrived early and we were happy to leave our bags and go wonder, but the receptionist tried to find a way to allow us to get to our room early, which was very nice of him. The hotel bar is very relaxing, with of course hotel prices, but guest get a discount which is nice. Breakfast was good and it was a mix of buffet and ordering your main breakfast meal E.g. Full English. The area is busy with lots of bars and restaurants and the hotel is close to many tourists spots, so the hotel is a good location to go visit these. Generally it’s a…"
5380,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Location fantastic- short distance from Tower Bridge and loads near by to see and do. Space outside to pull up to load and unload luggage which was really helpful. Very clean on entry and nice restaurant and bar area, again extremely clean and tidy. All corridors clean and well maintained. Also lovely pictures on the walls giving it a nice homely feel, felt quite traditional in the upstairs area which I liked. Bedroom very nice indeed. Clean, lovely traditional furninshings and lamps. Loved the old telephone!! Fridge with complimentary water. Nice tea tray with good selection of tea, chocolate, coffee pods with coffee machine. Lovely! Breakfast provided an excellent selection. Plant based choices which was fantastic! Staff at breakfast were lovely, very helpful and friendly.…"
5381,The Chamberlain Hotel,Have just arrived back from chamberlain Hotel after a very nice stay .the rooms are very comfortable and have all the facilities( ie kettle fridge milk etc) expected in a modern room .the staff are very friendly and helpful the rooms are cleaned and serviced everyday (whch is great deal better than begging for towels and bog rolls at reception as per some other hotel chains) the breakfast is excellent with wide choice of fare staff again are helpful(and just disprove a previous review you don't have to have burnt toast just turn the toaster down) the location of hotel is great 2mins to algate tube 3mins to Tower and plenty of dining options would stay again and would recommend
5382,The Chamberlain Hotel,"We weren’t guests of the hotel, but wandered in as the restaurant looked good. The breakfast was so disappointing - burnt toast, mediocre full English, and the avocado toast tasted like it was from prepackaged guacamole mix. The staff was extremely nice, but I would stick to drinks and not food here."
5383,The Chamberlain Hotel,We spent one night at the Chamberlain and really enjoyed our stay. The room was nice and even smelt great! The staff was very pleasant and the breakfast was great too. Very well located if you wish to see the Tower of London or take a walk along the Thames.
5384,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Decent location, staff at breakfast were very good,and a decent breakfast choice if you're early enough... Didn't eat anything else so can't comment on other meals. Rooms a little tired and very warm. I wouldn't like to stay here in Summer as it would be tropical."
5385,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Normal hotel, clean, nothing special. Very very very different from the picture in the web (at least my room). Far much more low profile and dark. Good price if you just need to sleep in a convinient location near the city. Breakfast is quite nice. Staff is super kind, polite and welcomibg."
5386,The Chamberlain Hotel,"I arrived at 9:00pm on a Sunday evening to find that the kitchen was already closed. After going somewhere else for food, I came back and had a glass of wine in the extremely bright and (strangely) simultaneously dull bar, which is staffed by slightly rude and clearly fed-up staff. My room was ok, but a little tired and not as clean as it should have been. The heating in the hotel was too high and the extremely strong smell of air freshener in the corridors made me wonder what it was hiding. It's not a terrible place, but there are several better hotels in the immediate vicinity, in a similar price bracket. I certainly won't be coming back. The receptionist was very nice, which is why I didn't rate it lower."
5387,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Great place to stay, easy walk to all the sights if you didn't want to take the tube and lots to see while walking - St Pauls, The Gherkin, lovely shops. Lovely, clean room with a great shower- plenty of room and nice and quiet. The food at the hotel is exceptional and a bonus with 15% discount for guests. Nice to sit outside with a glass of wine and watch the world go by. The staff at the hotel are what really made it - very friendly and helpful. So good that we have already booked to stay again."
5388,The Chamberlain Hotel,"On arrival the evening receptionist was nice, talked me through everything and pointed me in the direction of my room on the 1st floor. On the way to my room I could hear the woman in the room opposite having sex. I don't have a problem with that, however, I entered my room and shut the door and I could still hear her. It was at this point I realised the rooms were not sound proof. The room was nice, clean and spacious but it was nothing special. There was no view outside the large window and I could hear the trains passing every 10-15 minutes. The bathroom was nice and big and I made use of the bath however all night after the bath the pipes made clanging noises at regular intervals. Although the room was mainly clean, one of the flannels in the room was stained quite badly and…"
5389,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Stayed here for one night. The reception gentleman was friendly and super helpful. We needed to get to the )2 and he took time to tell us how to get there by tube or DLR. Nothing was too much trouble. The Bar Lady was also very helpful and warm. Room was clean and well furnished. Breakfast was good, but the one let down was that there was no one taking breakfast orders for hot food. Seemed somewhat disorganised. Other than that, perfect."
5390,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Everything you need in a comfy friendly place to stay. All staff very friendly and go out their way to help you, thats reception, bar and breakfast. Room clean and tidy. Location perfect for London Bridge. Very reasonably priced. Proper coffee machine in our room, we will return again soon."
5391,The Chamberlain Hotel,"We stayed here for two nights and thought the hotel itself was lovely. Nice spacious rooms and very clean. We were checked into our hotel room but went upstairs to find it still being cleaned. The cleaner kept apologising and rang reception to ask why they had let us check in, but she didn't take long so we didn't mind. Breakfast was nice too. Would definitely stay here again when visiting London"
5392,The Chamberlain Hotel,I booked this hotel for 1 night for my partners birthday and I'm so glad I did. Everything and everyone was amazing. Check in simple and quick. The room was great with a very powerful shower. Bar was great thank you Victoria for making me laugh all night. Breakfast was a feast so much choice. I've already booked to come back for my birthday in July. Thank you Ashley for sorting that for me so quickly!! See you in July.
5393,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Room was awful, the heating must have been broken so it was red hot all night. The air conditioning did not work. The evening meal at the hotel bar was dreadful, steak tough as old boots despite costing £30. They seemed to resent me ordering food. Nobody even checked to see how it was, I left most of it, surely someone should have asked what I thought? What was I supposed to do, take my plate back to the bar like Oliver and say it was rubbish? Breakfast wasn’t much better, had eggs benedict and it was Luke warm at best. When I checked out the lady at reception didn’t even ask how my stay was. I was fully prepared to say how bad an experience I had, but did not get the opportunity. It was clean though, that’s why two stars and not one. Would not stay there again."
5394,The Chamberlain Hotel,"We came for valentines weekend & it was a fantastic stay. We weren’t planning on staying in the hotel much but because of the facilities and the friendliness of the staff, we decided to have a meal there on the friday night and a few drinks - which ended up being the best meal of the weekend. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and it was a nice surprise to see our room was cleaned & our belongings neatened when we only popped out for a few hours. We will 100% stay here for our next visit to london as it’s close to the tube station (although they were on strike this weekend). Fantastic breakfast too, even if the full english was small."
5395,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Absolutely great hotel to spend a couple of days in London. This was my birthday gift to my wife and we loved our stay. Very friendly staff, the room was spacious, clean and with a very clean bathroom and a big, comfy bed. Breakfast was AWESOME too. Great choice of continental and then the cooked breakfast of your choice. And the location is unbeatable, very close to Liverpool Street Station and Tower Bridge and Tower of London. Simply one of the best hotels in the city."
5396,The Chamberlain Hotel,"fantastic location- Aldgate tube station at the top of the rd and Tower Hill at the bottom. A Co-op a few doors away. The Tower of London and the Thames at the end of the street. Staff at the hotel were young but pleasant and friendly. The attached pub serves breakfast and lunch but no meals after 2.30. However Slug and Lettuce is opposite and a pub further down. Reception area clean and inviting. Check in and Check out quick. We had a rooftop terrace room. A bit of a waste of money given the cold weather but nice and quiet. Bed large and comfy. Shower was a nice rainfall type shower head but over the bath. I think for the top room type it should have a separate walk in shower. the aircon was non existent but there was a Dyson heat/cold fan, strangely attached to the desk top ,…"
5397,The Chamberlain Hotel,"Really nice weekend stay at the chamberlain. Staff really friendly and helpful, the room was ready early. Nice big comfy bed & bathroom had luxurious feel with bath and separate rainfall shower. 15% in the attached pub was a nice touch too & special mention to the staff in here too. Breakfast was included and of a good standard. Plenty of drink options with breakfast which was nice. Great location, both Algate & Tower Hill stations less than 5 min walk away. Felt like value for money for a short stay in London & would recommend."
5398,The Chamberlain Hotel,"One of the best hotels I’ve stayed in in London, they let us check in early, the room was perfect not too big not too small, the hotel is spotless, breakfast was amazing, well the staff never met more friendlier staff couldn’t do enough for yer, location is really good few minutes walk from Aldgate tube, i go London at least once a month and this will be my go too hotel I love it x"
5399,The Chamberlain Hotel,Stayed for 2 nights for Remembrance Sunday (a trip I make every year). The room was OK and comfortable but the shower was very poor with low water pressure in the shower. The big issue with the room was the AC didn’t work. When we reported this to reception they out right said there was nothing they could do and we should just open the window. Not the best on a busy road! We had checked the breakfast times for the Sunday and as it was listed to start at 7am this matched our plans perfectly. But when we went for breakfast at 7:15 we were told only cold (continental) breakfast was available until 8am which was of no help at all. Why wasn’t this bit of rather important information listed??? Overall not bad for the price but not somewhere I will be returning too.
5400,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Should be SIX stars Fabulous one-night stay Wish we could have stayed longer - and enjoyed a dinner! Simply an amazing hotel staffed with amazing people! Immediately on arrival met with Natasha, whose warm welcome and 'can do' manner made us feel at ease immediately Supported by Camil who skilfully sorted a taxi - and later Emma was there to help with checking out and, oops, sending on a jacket my wife had left in the room! Thank you . . The room service team gave us cheerful greetings, too!! Staff who completely kept the customers satisfied! Location is just stunning Overlooking the harbour, could be in Monaco The room with a view was perfect Clean, beautifully furnished, comfortable and quiet One regret, that we couldn't have enjoyed a dinner, as we were attending a…"
5401,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We love this hotel! Since we discovered it we visit every year for our anniversary. Staff are all friendly and efficient and the hotel is beautiful. The copper rooms are outstanding with wonderful views, huge beds and a feature bath. The rooms are spotless throughout and extremely comfortable. Breakfast is fresh and delicious with a good choice of dishes."
5402,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We booked an impromptu trip to Salthouse and it did not disappoint. The service we received was 5 star. I would probably say it’s one of the best places I’ve stayed at in a long time. We upgraded to the copper bath bedrooms which was INCREDIBLE. The views were stunning and the beds were super comfy. We ate at the restaurant in the evening and again, the food was amazing. We then had breakfast in our bedroom in the morning. Plus there was no extra charge for this which was great. One thing I’m taking away from this is how nice every single member of staff was to us. We are 100% coming back and already planning our next trip. Thank you so much."
5403,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We attended as a group of 11 of mixed ages, for afternoon tea. It was fantastic that the children got to have their own mini afternoon tea selection. The staff were very accommodating and the food was excellent, would definitely recommend."
5404,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Our family group of 16 stayed here at the weekend to celebrate my dad's 80th birthday. The rooms were well appointed and very clean. We had afternoon tea, dinner, bed and breakfast. We had a wide range of dietary needs (children's menu, vegetarian, pescatarian and gluten free) and were all very well catered for. The food was excellent. We had superb service from the whole team - welcoming and friendly, attentive but unobtrusive. The staff really helped to make it a truly memorable weekend. Highly recommend."
5405,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We spent new year here, as we have done for a number of years. We had a wonderful time. The rooms are lovely, very well equipped and comfy. The staff are very ftiendly, professional and helpful. We had a great meal, and saw the New Year in, in style. The hotel is right on the quay, so a nice area to wander around."
5406,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Stayed for a weekend with 3 other couples. Parking limited to first come serve basis but when full cars are then taken to an open air car park 100 yards along the marina. Rooms are spacious and comfy, bed was huge and great size bathroom with separate double shower as well as a free standing bath. Lunch and dinner was in the main restaurant, both were very well presented although food and drinks are a little expensive. Staff are a credit to the hotel, nothing was too much to ask. Special mention to Shane who looked after us during dinner and breakfast, he was superb. His attention to detail was exemplary and he cannot be underestimated. He went out of his way on countless occasions, it no surprise he has been at The Salthouse for 15 year……keep up the good work Shane. Likewise,…"
5407,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"I'm a Chantry boy, but have been away a long time. We had occasion to stay here a couple of weeks back and what a splendid decision to stay here. Now, rambling a bit but bear with me, when I was a kid in the 60s if I had been caught by my parents playing around what was then a working dock, I would have been in trouble but now! Massive redevelopment and it has been really well done. So to the hotel. We arrived from Singapore at about 21.45, we just missed the A12 closure so kudos to the taxi driver and checked in, a pretty smooth process and we went to the room. It was a decent size, nice clean bathroom and a great view of the marina. We did a perfunctory unpack then hustled down to the bar as I was quite thirsty. Breakfast was included so next morning we rocked up and…"
5408,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Really lovely hotel with harbour views. Fantastic value for the price paid. The room is spacious and the bed really comfortable, I got a good night of sleep. There's a wide range of a-la-carte options for breakfast and there's the option of having it delivered to your room at a pre-booked time which was nice! Would definitely recommend and would visit again."
5409,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We have just returned from the most wonderful romantic break. Everything was effortless, from having our car parked for us, fantastic reception team giving directions to the theatre and just the most perfect room 306 looking out to the marina. The room is so unlike any other hotel room. It's really quirky with so much thought to comfort and decor. The character of the brickwork walls, old radiator and beautiful furnishings, with a view of the marina, Quay and across the county. Our room had double aspect windows for an all round landscape. The bed is comfy and enormous as was having a lovely soak in the bath with the toiletries provided. Breakfast was amazing. No queuing for a buffet, just perfect service, again looking out to the Quay. Many, many thanks to the wonderful team,…"
5410,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Real quality hotel, absolutely ideal for our work & play couple of days. High standard hotel in a great location on Ipswich Marina - we had a harbour view room with balcony - gorgeous sunset & sunrise right from our balcony. Great dinner and breakfasts in the Eaterie - and the team, led by Paolo are top notch - friendly and professional, we didn’t see the chef but they obviously know what they’re doing too. Very comfortable room, perfect shower, slept very well. Nothing to fault in our 2-night stay, and everything to love about the Salthouse. We’ll definitely be back - recommend very highly!"
5411,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Vegetarian/Vegan options Whether today 25th January was our unlucky day to visit this establishment but check before booking If you dont like Artichokes then you wouldn’t be eating much. All the options included artichokes, couldn’t believe it. Also the server got the order wrong and one guest had to wait for a new meal to be cooked. And to make natters worse, we were charged £28.50 gratuity/service charge Have been visiting Salthouse at least every 3 months and this was the worst visit Will have to think again"
5412,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"An excellent Quayside location, lovely hotel, high spec room. Ideally located in the Neptune Marina. Staff very polite & friendly. If you are driving, probably best to get there early, we arrived at 1pm for a 3pm check in, but could leave the car in the hotel car park. There are quite a few spaces there, but it was nearly full when we arrived."
5413,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,We were treated to an overnight stay at the Salthouse Harbour Hotel by friends and it fitted the bill perfectly. It is ideally located on the waterfront in Ipswich with splendid views right across to the Orwell bridge from our 3rd floor balcony. When the lights came on on the boats at night we could almost believe we were in St Tropez! Our room was extremely well appointed and very comfortable with every amenity we needed for a short stay. We used the bar/restaurant for both dinner and breakfast and were not disappointed with the quality and standard of the meals. The staff were extremely polite and attentive. Would stay again.
5414,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Went for lunch today. The starter of scallops was gorgeous but my main of salmon was poor. The kale was inedible, the roast salmon was cold and I couldn't find any wild mushrooms on my plate. The sauvinon wine was lovely though"
5415,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Had a search around for somewhere to get away for a night within an hour of us and opted for Ipswich rather than Cambridge and we are happy we did. Great staff, awesome view with a fabulous bath. Had dinner in the restaurant on my own in the evening and was looked after very well. We will definitely return."
5416,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We were in town for a business event and we all really liked the Salthouse. It is a very stylish boutique hotel, with many helpful and smiling staff and great rooms, Also very clean and well maintained. We also had a great dinner in the restaurant and all of the food was perfectly cooked and delicious. I had a harbour view room with a small balcony and it was nice to wake up and for a sunrise view over the marina. And within walking distance to other restaurants and bars. highly recommend."
5417,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"From the moment we went in the staff were amazing could not be more helpful and so friendly The hotel was amazing , very happy the room was beautiful and the shower was great like a spa Food too class too Will definitely go back and excellent value for money Thankyou"
5418,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Just returned from a one night stay at this fabulous hotel. We were celebrating my special birthday and couldn’t of selected a better hotel to do it in. Hotel has a lovely ambience. We were upgraded to a penthouse suite which was just perfect. Super views, well furnished. Comfy bed. Clean and well presented. Was staying on a DB&B basis and the food did not disappoint!! Served hot and presented well. Good quality and tasty. Service at this hotel is of the best standard! They go the extra mile to make your time with them special. Nothing is too much trouble. Friendly and professional at all times. Would highly recommend this place and we stay again in a heartbeat. Well done Salthouse Harbour Hotel you deserve these great reviews!"
5419,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"I got a good deal on a comfortable room - the bed was a bit firm for me, but that’s just a matter of taste. Otherwise the room and bathroom were excellent. I only stayed for one night, but found the hotel full of cheerful, friendly staff doing their job well. What more can you ask?"
5420,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We couldn’t fault this hotel from the moment someone very politely came and parked our car, helped with luggage, until we checked out with the very polite helpful receptionist. The food was lovely, we had breakfast, lunch and dinner, all great"
5421,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,Visited as part of very special family celebration. We are new to navigating places with a wheelchair & choose the hotel for accessibility & wonderful views. It surpassed expectation....the whole team excellent. Evening meal wonderful. The hotel has unusual artwork throughout and all in all an absolute joy to stay at. We'll be back
5422,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Graduation night for my partner , company was amazing, conversation engaging and interesting. The ambiance and surroundings are fabulous. That’s it , the rest was shocking !!! £30 for a steak that was as tough as leather , a very curt and uninterested waitress, a menu soooo short and restricted, the list is long ……. We smiled throughout because it was a special day for our partners but the whole experience was very poor , we’ve had better nights in the wimpy !!!!!"
5423,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,What a lovely hotel brilliantly located. We only stayed 1 night room was spacious and very clean. Decor is fab very quirky throughout the hotel. Bed was really comfortable too. Tea/coffee facilities in the room great selection and biscuits. We had breakfast the next morning in the hotel was very nice. Will defiantly return!
5424,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"My family treated me to a wonderful graduation dinner here after my ceremony and we were not disappointed. The staff were extremely friendly and recognised that I had graduated, by surprising me with a wonderful dessert plate and congratulating me in person. The food was exquisite and the wine choice was exceptional. I would definitely dine here again, we might even stay next time… Thank you to the team at the salt house for making my experience magical."
5425,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"My husband and I stayed here last week for 4 nights as part of a small tour. Can only reiterate what other reviewers have said. Rooms were large, comfy and clean, and great to have a stand alone shower, and a bath. Food was excellent and presentation was great. Breakfast was served to us, and the quality was very good. Then all the staff, in any area, what can I say? A great team, so friendly and organised in the dining room. Cannot fault our trip in any way."
5426,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We only stopped one night (this time) but the staff were so friendly and helpful, the rooms so beautiful and the views so good we definitely want to go again. We didn't eat there in the evening but did have some very nice cocktails, and the breakfast the next morning was excellent. Highly recommend the copper bath rooms, very luxurious!"
5427,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,had a one night stay here at the salt house got a very good upgrade to the copper bath room over looking the mariner. Staff polite friendly and willing to help. restaurant food great .staff fantastic .hotel room fantastic. over all faultless.
5428,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"A gorgeous interior, interesting art work and excellent customer service. This afternoon tea was up there with the best. I chose the vegetarian option (not sure if they offered vegan) and the array of savories and sandwiches were inventive and of exceptional quality. The cakes were just as delicious. The scones were unusual, slightly chewy and smaller than the usual crumbly doorsteps that you just can't manage! Sadly the cream was not fresh, but UHT in a little jar. Convenient for the kitchen maybe, but lacked the indulgent clotted cream gorgeousness you expect. Waiting staff were very attentive and topped up our pots of tea regularly. As our table was required for the next sitting, we were offered the lounge to continue. It would have been nice to have been…"
5429,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We stayed here on a Sunday before the Queens funeral. As always wonderful room, great staff and a great experience. We use this hotel for a mini break and have stayed many times. This place just gets better and better. Definitely be visiting again."
5430,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We spent three days at Salthouse Harbour Hotel for my birthday on the basis of the good recommendations' on Tripadvisor but were very disappointed with our visit. The room had a lovely view of the boats on the estuary but was a bit small for the price (we paid £430+ per night for bed and breakfast). It was advertised as having a desk (although it was for my birthday I had some work to do) but the ""desk"" turned out to be a table that was so constructed that you could not use it with a chair; I had to make do with a side table. The room was OK but there was little drawer space (three small drawers in the table), the curtain lining we found to be torn when the light came through first thing in the morning and the extractor fan in the shower room did not work so it was a bit like a…"
5431,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Perfect...! The room was lovely very clean, warm, comfortable with everything I needed. Loved the decor. Fantastic bathrooms space with shower and bath. Views right on harbour. The food was excellent for both dinner and breakfast for anyone with gluten allergies and the restaurant was superb....what a treat! Staff were attentive and friendly and very knowledgeable about the hotel and took the time to take me through the interesting art work throughout the main hotel. Just loved it! Will definitely be back....well done to the Salthouse for such a fantastic place Sadly I can't upload the photos here but will try again."
5432,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Had such a lovely visit for afternoon team. Staff were dedicated and attentive. Allergies and preferences were catered for well. The food was fresh and tasted wonderful. A variety of teas available and these and limitless. The price is also very reasonable. The restaurant, toilets and lobby were absolutely spotless and presented well. Will be coming back!"
5433,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Really boutique modern interiors, clean rooms and marina view is worth the extra money! The eaterie does fantastic food and there is also a handful of great restaurants in a short strolling distance. Bed was super comfortable, and room well ventilated/ + air con. Can fault it at all."
5434,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"The staff in this hotel are rare. They were happy, professional and extremely helpful. It made my stay very pleasant. Nothing was too much trouble. The receptionist, bar staff , room service, chambermaids and restaurant staff, well done."
5435,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"I've stayed in quite alot of hotels in the UK which state been a four star establishment but none have been a patch on this superb hotel. The staff cannot do enough for you and are extremely pleasant, rooms are great, so is the food. Room service very punctual. I suggest to pay the extra for a marina view."
5436,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"We've stayed at the Salthouse for one night to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary and what a fabulous stay we had! We've been upgraded (for a very reasonable fee) to the Penthouse Suite (room 605) and it made our stay extra special. Huge thank you for this kind offer to the very nice lady at the reception (sorry, we didn't ask your name)! The room is stunning, it is very spacious and its stylish designer interior is amazing! Every detail is thought through to bring style and comfort together for a luxury hotel stay experience. And of course, the views from the room are simply unbeatable! You can look directly into marina and you can enjoy watching beautiful yachts going in and out while chilling on the sofa or from the bed. Breakfast was very good, we had it in the breakfast…"
5437,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,When we arrived we were offered (for a very reasonable cost) an upgrade to the room with the copper bath overlooking the marina. It was so worth it. The room was luxurious. The copper bath was fantastic. The view was a treat. The staff were so friendly and approachable. Breakfast was delicious and of a good quality. Would definitely recommend.
5438,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Superbly situated and this is matched by top class facilities, excellent food plus friendly service. The staff were also first class with nothing be too much trouble. I have mobility problems and was assisted when necessary"
5439,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Wonderful hotel in a perfect location. The staff is friendly, the location is prime and the rooms are modern and lovely. The breakfast is also outstanding and I wouldn’t look for anywhere else in Ipswich. The service provided by the hotel staff and porters was excellent. I can’t recommend highly enough."
5440,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"I booked a hotel room to support a proposal and the staff were perfect from the outset. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The room held a gorgeous view of the waterfront. The meal was absolutely amazing, the best steak I've had in years. Everything was perfect and I cannot rate the experience high enough. I fully recommend the hotel for anyone visiting Ipswich."
5441,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"4 nights at The Salthouse and it was excellent. Attentive, friendly staff. Beautiful food and stunning setting. Clean and spacious room with bath and separate shower. Cafetiere in room and coffee, water and biscuits replaced daily. Highly recommended."
5442,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"This hotel is located in what I would describe as a fairly trendy upmarket part of Ipswich, opposite the Marina. It is close to bars, restaurants and night clubs however, my wife and I are in our late 60's so this is not an issue for us. The room was expensive but very nice with an outstanding view of the harbour. What made this a very special visit was the Hotel staff. Without exception, they were warm, friendly, welcoming and kind to us. In short, they could have not been more helpful. Of Particular note was the conscierge in the car park! (Dont know his name but we will never forget him) Also the reception staff who were extremely helpful and efficient. To summarize, this is an excellent hotel located in the centre of Ipswich and if you want to stay at a quality hotel in…"
5443,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,What a fantastic place! Staff couldn’t be any more accommodating x Beautiful surroundings and such a chilled vibe x Reasonable prices for food and drink too x The restaurant is fantastic and the service second to nun Well done Salt-house x
5444,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Very happy in our Marina view suite, great views of the marina and seagulls flitting past, with air-conditioning on a very hot day, which was most welcome. Some lovely touches in the room, nice toiletries and comfortable and clean bedding. The hotel restaurant and bar were very nicely designed and comfortable to hang out in for a cocktail or two. We will come back to visit en route to East Suffolk again."
5445,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Lovely hotel in a great location in the Ipswich Harbour area...the best part of the city by far! The hotel is modern, quirky and full of character. The room was outstanding with amazing views over the harbour (£40 upgrade, but worth every penny). Privacy glass in the bathroom, air-con and great fixtures too made the rooms stand out. The staff were just superb in every department too and couldn't do enough to make the stay more enjoyable. The restaurant food was delicious too, especially the desserts...and the Posset was the best I've ever tasted. This has to be the only place to stay in Ipswich! Valet parking too for my blue-badge which was appreciated."
5446,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"I have just come back from a five-night stay at this wonderful hotel on the waterfront in Ipswich. What a gem! A superb hotel with stunning views over the marina, full of quirky artwork and charm, with gorgeous bedrooms. The beds are comfortable, the hotel is quiet, rooms and the public areas are beautifully appointed and decorated but the best things about this hotel are the staff and the food. It's clear from management down that everyone loves working at the Salthouse Harbour Hotel. All the staff are charming, professional and really care. And the food.....wow! Utterly delicious. We have booked to return next year alreadty. Thank you to Rachel and all the team at the hotel for looking after us so well."
5447,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"Lovely venue , friendly staff , excellent Afternoon Tea and cocktails . First class service and super selection on the Afternoon Tea menu . Thoroughly enjoyed the experience . Afterwards we had cocktails in the lounge , which was a fabulous people watching spot ! Thank you"
5448,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,The hotel is cosy and quiet. A view to a harbour was excellent. Very friendly staff at the restaurant. The breakfast was a la carte which was a bit exceptional but still tasty. Location is quite central but for example one morning our taxi was late more than an hour due to traffic jam in the city centre.
5449,Salthouse Harbour Hotel,"I stayed here on several occasions on business. Lovely rooms, big bed, big clean bathroom with tub and shower combo. Friendly staff also. Let’s not forget about the view if you are lucky to get a room facing the harbour. The restaurant however is expensive."
5450,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Came to see powis castle. Royal Oak had secure parking,comfy beds and a quiet nights sleep. Welcome note in the bedroom nice touch. Staff friendly and attentive. I am a bit unsteady on my feet and busy manager carried my drinks out to the beer garden. We ate in and portions were generous. Good breakfast menu As well. I would recommend this hotel"
5451,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Amazing hotel. Rooms are spot on and well equipped. Staff are friendly, courteous and attentive and the food is fantastic. We had a very comfortable and relaxed stay as a group of biking friends and the hotel was perfect for this with secure gated parking at the rear for the bikes. Would definitely stay here again and highly likely I will."
5452,The Royal Oak Hotel,"The Royal Oak had been recommended to us as a great place to stay, we certainly were not disappointed! The very high standard of cleanliness, service and well presented delicious meals was first class. All the staff were helpful, friendly and eager to please. The Coaching Inn Escapes package was excellent value. We will return for another stay at sometime to visit this wonderful part of Wales."
5453,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Stayed for one night as part pf road trip with my dog. V dog friendly. Lovely bar and dining room, room bigger than the average. Food excellent but staff were AMAZING! And such good value. Stayed somewhere else on this trip and was charged nearly double the rate for an inferior experience. V pleased."
5454,The Royal Oak Hotel,"A nice coaching inn, all of the staff were very friendly and attentive, breakfast was good and with a good selection. The rooms were a good size and had nice features, however could do with a bit of freshening up. Overall I will stay there again if I was in the area. It is right in the centre of Welshpool and has a private car park out the back."
5455,The Royal Oak Hotel,We had a very warm welcome at the Royal Oak Hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful with great a sense of humour. The room was spacious and beautifully presented. Food was very good with plenty of choice. They also have an excellent range of gins too! Welshpool although small is in a great location amid beautiful scenery - close to Powys Castle and the Welshpool and Llanfair narrow gauge railway - both well worth a visit. All in all a great experience.
5456,The Royal Oak Hotel,"We stayed here to attend a Wedding at The Giraffe Shed. Other Friends who were guests stayed as well. We had a huge welcome from Mandy on the Reception Desk who booked us in but also did much more. All the staff were friendly and efficient. Our room was perfect. Nicely decorated and appointed. Everything you could possibly need when away from home was there. It was clean and the bed was super comfortable. Lunch, Evening Meal and Breakfast were fresh and delicious with plenty of choice. The Royal Oak is well positioned for the town (doorstep) and sightseeing the area. Pretty walled sun trap of a garden to relax in and a gated car park. A proper unique Hotel."
5457,The Royal Oak Hotel,"The room was small but ""adequate."" The food was satisfactory but the evening menu wasn't exciting. The full choice at breakfast wasn't clear, Full English was clear but what cereals had to be requested along with yogurt. But what cast a shadow over my visit and indeed has clouded my views above was the incident on leaving. My colleagues are both in their 80's and carried large heavy bags. No one attempted to offer to carry their bags to or from their room. Indeed after they left, as I am ""Disabled,"" and had advised reception of this fact, requested ""assistance"" getting my cases from my room to my car was advised that ""no one"" was available! Hence staff watched as I struggled with my luggage. I was not best pleased and hence ""it's the little things you remember!"
5458,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Outstanding! Fantastic location. History galore. Staff and atmosphere amazing. All staff great, but remember Charlotte in particular. Room perfect, can't fault breakfast, superb.👌 Thank you. Wonderful Vintage Shop, thank you Di Ashman. Highly recommend for anyone visiting North Wales. Went onto Oswestry, which is also worth visiting."
5459,The Royal Oak Hotel,This is a very comfortable hotel not far off the Offa's Dyke Path. The room was not very large but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom shower worked well. I cannot fault the cleanliness. The staff were all very friendly and the food (evening meal and breakfast) tasty and well served.
5460,The Royal Oak Hotel,We recently attended for a company event. The team at the Royal Oak were really helpful and very friendly. Food was fantastic and we received a lot of positive feedback from our guests! I would definitely recommend The Royal Oak for a dinner/event.
5461,The Royal Oak Hotel,"My friend and I were given a warm welcome by the staff team. The room was clean, modern and well appointed. Dinner and breakfast were really nice. Good location for the train station. Thank you for a great stay!"
5462,The Royal Oak Hotel,"My wife and I stayed for two nights with a meal package. We've stayed at and really enjoyed one of the Coaching Group's sister hotels (the Feathers at Ledbury) a couple of times. Unfortunately, the Royal Oak fell far short of our expectations based on this! Firstly, the good parts. The staff were friendly, accommodating, and very hard working. When we expressed our disappointment, they offered to change rooms (one remaining, but worse), and threw in a bottle of wine with the meal. However, our room was tired, a fair bit of street noise into the early hours, stuffy, and too warm to sleep easy. The shower had mould and the water pressure poor. The mains of the meal were both very mediocre, with the beef tough and overcooked and served with limp vegetables. The starters were,…"
5463,The Royal Oak Hotel,This is a very old property and has been lovingly restored. The room we had is 104 and it was over the kitchens. This room is hot because of it's location but more so noisy till around 11.00pm when the kitchen shuts down. The only other criticism was the stairs were not vacuumed for the two and a half days we were there. Staff were good food was excellent. Room could do with some TLC other than that very good
5464,The Royal Oak Hotel,Will never be returning here and would not recommend it to anyone. Me and my family were visiting Welshpool so decided to stay here for a bite to eat. Unfortunately we were so disappointed with the service that as soon as we finished eating we decided to leave Welshpool and travel back home. It completely ruined our day. The prices are extortionate for what we got and not one meal was half decent. It came to over £40 for fish and chips and a sandwich (the bread was more like toast it was that stale). Two other of my family members also had a sandwich and they were all stale. We we're also charged £8 for a shandy as we were charged separately for the beer and lemonade. Like I say not one meal was ok out of all my family. The chicken was so salty it was like the whole jar fell…
5465,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Been a number of times. Mostly friendly and very helpful staff. Has a good menu, eaten lunch here before and fancied thier breakfast advertised as available before midday, sadly they no longer do breakfast. Had a croisant, which was chewy. Still tea was nice, nice place to visit, Ill keep to the midday meals, which rate a higher score than todays visit."
5466,The Royal Oak Hotel,"First time here. It's not the bog standard Holiday Inn, or other chain hotels. It's bang centre of Welshpool (not that it needed to be as Welshpool seemed void of life), nice bar, restaurant and breakfast were great, comfortable room, slept like a baby, quirky and nostalgic, good parking around the back away from prying eyes, check in was quick, check out the same. Beer was good. Bang on!!"
5467,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Lovely couple of nights away, whole experience enjoyable. Room clean, great location and food in the restaurant really good. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We would recommend this hotel, thank you."
5468,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Dropped lucky finding The Royal Oak! Great all round, the whole place is wonderful. The building is great, quality decor around the hotel and wonderful room. The staff are friendly and helpful. Thoroughly recommended!"
5469,The Royal Oak Hotel,Four in a bed review. Premium hotel so expect premium prices in bar and restaurant. Hospitality good nice staff friendly and welcoming. Room and hotel clean. No lifts in hotel so old and inform might be a problem getting to bedrooms. Breakfast basic but delicious. Good location. Would I stay here again Yes we would.
5470,The Royal Oak Hotel,"I stopped off while travelling for a bar meal. The bar was quiet but a nice environment. The staff were friendly. I had fish and chips which were good pub style. The portions were big. Obviously a hotel, but close to the main road so a decent place to stop for a break or a bite to eat if travelling through."
5471,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Friendly staff , clean hotel , lovely room with en suite ...a tad bit hot but a fan was provided in room along with other things you might need...ideal location fir us we parked car up for weekend and just walked , fab little railway half a mile away from The Royal oak . Would definitely stay here again 😁"
5472,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Lovely hotel, lovely room, lovely food and great staff. Sadly, being an old building, the rooms next to the main road had windows that made you feel you were sleeping in the road. Despite having 'secondary glazing' , this had virtually no effect. There was a pub/ club across the road playing loud music until 1am, followed by people noise until around 2am. There was general traffic noise too. A real shame as it could be a great place to visit, they just need to look at further noise insulation or at least offer earplugs. When we told the receptionist, she claimed only one or two others had mentioned it, and next time we come, ask for a room on the other side of the building! Don't think we'll be returning anytime soon 🤔"
5473,The Royal Oak Hotel,We had a good family weekend to celebrate my uncles 100th birthday. The hotel is very pleasant if old and is what is expected with small stairs and corridors. My one complaint is that the old window frames outside the double glazing in the rooms are absolutely filthy and badly reflect on the rest of the hotel. This is something that is easily dealt with using cleaner and a cloth and cannot be ignored by guests.
5474,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Great hotel, we stayed one night whilst walking Offas Dyke footpath. Warm welcome, comfortable accommodation and really lovely staff. Great food, good breakfast choices. Very relaxing. Only thing I don’t like is the volume of emails once you have booked. They really want you to pre book the restaurant so it’s not unusual to get two emails a week until you do! May as well book the restaurant because there isn’t anywhere else in town !"
5475,The Royal Oak Hotel,The hotel is well situated in the town centre. Good car park secured and controlled. Service was great and staff was friendly. We had dinner and the food was great and at breakfast as well. I’d stay here again for sure when visiting next time. The only difficulty was initially to find the car park entrance as I had to call hotel so they could explain me how to find it which they explained well and was easy to get there but it’s easily missed when driving. Overall great stay. Thank you.
5476,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Excellent location! Friendly staff and happy smiling cleaners! Poor communication regarding breakfast. Not offered cereal or fresh fruit but, could see others were partaking. This was viewed too late to moan about. Extremely noisy Friday & Saturday nights, got ‘no sleep’ whatsoever! The room was sweltering but, a bladeless cooling fan was available plus another bladed fan. Spoke volumes."
5477,The Royal Oak Hotel,"This historic coaching inn provides a comfortableand convenient base for a short break in Welshpool. Meals and accommodation excellent with good bar and restaurant. Both the full and vegan cooked breakfasts were hearty and delicious. We stayed in a Superior Ensuite Room which was spacious and attractively furnished. Staff were always friendly and helpful, making for a most pleasant stay. The Inn is within walking distance of the stunning Powis Castle & Gardens and also just around the corrner from the Welshpool Llanfair Caereinion Steam Railway, evoking memories of a bygone era. Free, secure on-site car parking at the Inn is a real plus. This midweek break, kindly bought for us by our son, was greatly enjoyed."
5478,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Room cosy ie smaller than most but one of the nicest we have stayed in . Well designed and furnished with quality curtains and at home touches such as feature mirrors, Roberts radio, books, nice boxes for O&X s, cards and most welcome real glasses for water and mugs with multiple tea and chocolate selection. Excellent shower. Food was above average mains and interesting choices- try the beetroot risotto. Puds lacked in presentation n so the only ordinary part of the experience. Staff without exception were available, willing and helpful. This must be led from the top and will undoubtedly stay in a Coaching Inn again. Still reading through the fascinating 28 page history the Inn (free on the website)."
5479,The Royal Oak Hotel,"The ambiance of the hotel was very pleasant and the room was welcoming and clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately the dinner was poor, but the breakfast was good. The traffic noise made sleeping almost impossible"
5480,The Royal Oak Hotel,Good visit evening meal on Friday evening was very good friendly and helpful waitress Didn’t find Sunday breakfast as good as the Saturday which was good so bit disappointed staff not very friendly really didn’t feel relaxed for us but other staff friendly
5481,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Very poor afternoon tea, the scones were stale ( but were replaced) but still very small, the 'sweet treats' were very small more like bit size. The photos on the their website looked nothing like our afternoon tea"
5482,The Royal Oak Hotel,Fabulous 2 night short break. Upgraded to Deluxe bedroom. Huge bath in the room plus large separate en-suite shower room. The room was beautiful with very tasteful soft furnishings and decor. We had 2 evening meals which were delicious and 2 plentiful and tasty breakfasts. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Beautiful walk to Powys Castle from the town centre. Would highly recommend. Ask for specific directions to get to car park as there is a one-way system which could catch you out!!
5483,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Despite arriving in wet and muddy clothing, after walking along the Offa's Dyke, we were welcomed warmly by the reception staff at The Royal Oak. Our bedroom was comfortable, tastefully decorated and very quiet. We enjoyed a delicious meal in the restaurant in the evening, with impeccable service, and a very good breakfast the next day. The hotel is very well located right near the centre of Welshpool and a very short distance from the train station. Would definitely stay again."
5484,The Royal Oak Hotel,"From the welcome , to the room, to the food, couldn`t fault anything! I would highly recommend staying here! Loved the history of the building and getting to stay in the room where Queen Elizabeth stayed was a real treat."
5485,The Royal Oak Hotel,"An excellent experience , we stayed here for one night due to our booked hotel having to close as a result of a loss of electricity. We managed to book the last room at the hotel, a very nice suite. The staff were excellent, in particular our waitress, Snejana, who was just superb. The food was very very good, our starters of Ham hock terrine and a very large goats cheese salad were just excellent. The mains of Gammon and sea bass were top class. The bar service was again exceptional, a great choice of wines and spirits. Overall an excellent hotel with great staff and top quality food."
5486,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Lovely stay at Royal Oak. Staff were welcoming and helpful, room was clean and comfortable and breakfast hot and tasty. We had a late checkin at midnight. Staff we’re expecting us and welcomed us in. Checkin was quick and efficient. A very nice change from the big hotel chains"
5487,The Royal Oak Hotel,"The Royal Oak has, first and foremost, excellent staff; all very cheerful and efficient which creates a great atmosphere. There is an extensive bar area serving the same food as the adjacent restaurant which also produces marvellous breakfasts! Highly recommend."
5488,The Royal Oak Hotel,"This was a lovey surprise as we booked last minute to have an overnight stay on a long journey. The room was fabulous - four poster bed, huge bath and an enormous shower. We felt very spoiled. Such a warm welcome, even including a hand written welcome note from the housekeeping team. The simple things that matter. The meal in the restaurant was delicious and I was able to work in my room on a conference call thanks to the late check out and great wi-fi. We will definitely be back"
5489,The Royal Oak Hotel,"This is a pub hotel that's a cut above the normal level. The rooms are stylish, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent (Sunday wasn't as good, perhaps not the usual staff?) and plentiful. The staff were attentive, welcoming and warm. It's a lovely, historic building too. Be aware that it's in the centre of town, so there was a little bit of noise in front-facing rooms as people went home from pubs, bars and the sole club. However, Welshpool is hardly Blackpool so it was only a few voices passing by."
5490,The Royal Oak Hotel,"The hotel, food in the restaurant and staff are fantastic - the only downside was the heat in the bedroom (and the inability to turn the radiator off), the location is also ideal for visiting places nearby - looking forward to going back later on in the year."
5491,The Royal Oak Hotel,"This hotel exceeded our expectations. The staff were friendly and helpful even when really busy. The room was spacious and clean and the décor fitted the age of the building. The evening meal was very good, the steak is one of the best I've had in ages. And the breakfast was great, real bacon! Would highly recommend."
5492,The Royal Oak Hotel,"En route to North Wales from Hampshire to visit family, our car broke down outside Welshpool. With garages and car hire places closed for the bank holidays, we phoned The Royal Oak to see if they could accommodate use until we could hire a car to continue our journey. They could, so we turned up, having had a stressful time, and they couldn't have been more welcoming. A special mention goes to Esther on reception, she went that extra mile to help us. All the staff, from the waiting staff to the cleaners, were so welcoming and caring. The rooms were beautiful, so comfortable and clean, the food fab.Out of a stressful situation The Royal Oak was a real haven for us, until we were finally able to get transport to our destination. Thank you, and we hope to visit again, (although…"
5493,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Dropped in for lunch last week, as we do from time to time when in Welshpool. Good lunch/dining menu, which they will serve you in lounge or you can go into dining room at no extra charge. Food was as good as always, and matter when we eat at Royal Oak ( lunch, dinner or Sunday lunch) it's always consistently good."
5494,The Royal Oak Hotel,"You know you're in a hotel that has great customer service when there is a hand written note from the housekeeping team, welcoming you to your room! Everyone was friendly and great at their job especially Laura on reception and Gemma in the restaurant. Proper good old fashioned customer service that is so rare these days. The room was full of character and very clean. Even though it's in the town centre it was quiet. Loved our short time there and will definitely go again when in the area. Lovely bar area/ daytime coffee and tea room as well. Thank you everyone!"
5495,The Royal Oak Hotel,"Fine hotel, great main street location with secure parking. Comfortable rooms, high quality breakfast and evening menu. Bar with good selection of local ales and bottled drinks. We stay a number of times each year to enjoy Welshpool and the nearby mid-Wales scenes."
5496,The Royal Oak Hotel,"I chose to book with the Royal Oak for the purposes of taking my Welsh exam late January - it was convenient, as it's about a 10-minute walk from the examination centre, 15 minutes from the train station, and slap-bang in the middle of the town. I arrived about half an hour before my reservation time but the receptionists were happy to admit me early. It was easy enough to find the room (102) and get settled. The room fitted the bill perfectly - not huge, but they've done really well with the space. There's a wardrobe with space on top, a desk with drawers (plus lamp), more drawers where the tea station is located, a cabinet and shelving unit in the en-suite (which has both a bath and power shower), and bedside tables. You're not going to hurt for storage here! The decoration…"
5497,The Royal Oak Hotel,"We enjoyed a two night stay over New Years which included a New Years eve dinner. It was certainly one of the best stays we have had, the food was outstanding, the hotel clean and tidy and the staff very friendly and attentive."
5498,The Royal Oak Hotel,"An annual tradition of Christmas away from home was continued by a visit to Welshpool (a first) and a stay at the Royal Oak. The first challenge was to access the on site parking - a bit of a conundrum but helped greatly by a lovely staff member, who sympathised with the difficulty, and proceeded to walk me through the hotel to show me how to get to the car park even while she was busily entertaining lunchtime guests. A helpful and friendly plus The hotel is as it boasts - a large and airy building well laid out on the ground floor for entertaining with well signed rooms on the upper floors Fabulous room, a welcome handwritten note from housekeeping and ….. chocolate. Just the right touch As a solo traveller, especially at Christmas, it can be a little awkward. Not here - with…"
5499,The Royal Oak Hotel,Lovely hotel steeped in history.We stayed overnight and all the staff were so professional and friendly and bar food was good too.Our room had recently been refurbished and was clean and comfortable. Good value and highly recommend this hotel
5500,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Helmsley is lovely. The Feathers is also. Nicely maintained, old world charm but not at all shabby like some. Super friendly staff who go out of their way to help. Nice breakfast. Will stay here again when back in Helmsley."
5501,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Avoid room 6 like the plague, it’s terrible and check if the hotel has any functions booked because if so, you won’t be allowed to eat in the hotel at the same time. The function was very noisy and obviously room 6 is above it, so no sleep until everyone had left. A room of this size and location, being charged at over £100 per night is shocking."
5502,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Booked a table with a week notice, in the pub for 5 adults, 2 kids with 3 dogs. Tracey was initially very helpful, pre ordered food and confirmed our booking. Great… or so we thought. Attended on the day and felt like we were putting people out. Considering there was 7 of us with 3 dogs we were shown to a half opened function area at the back bar with no atmosphere and felt more like a lonely restaurant and a nice carpet, NOT what we had booked with kids and 3 dogs. We asked if we could go outside to which we were told they don’t serve food outside, I walked out to see a table of 5 eating away, quite happily. So heading back in, I asked to speak to the manager, Ruba or a name similar. Who told me that food cannot be served outside due to staff shortage (the extra 30seconds it…"
5503,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","I really cannot recommend the Feathers highly enough, Everything from the welcome, the room, the fabulous food, and leaving was brilliant, Nothing is too much trouble, and every member of staff are helpful and friendly. Iv already booked my room for the next visit to Helm."
5504,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Well we have just come back from Helmsley with a stay at the feathers hotel for two nights. We took our Labrador and we have to say the hotel and staff are brilliant! Being a dog friendly hotel yes you expect carpet to be a little worn here and there but the room was absolutely spotless and tea coffee, bathrobes and slippers , dog bowl, treats and doggie bags and a tennis ball is a fantastic touch! Also a bottle of water each and chocolates and biscuits! I want to say thank you to the chef who made my dog scrambled eggs for breakfast! A lovely place and walks around Helmsley and great coffee shops! My husband had a meal also in the feathers at night as I wasn’t feeling too well and said it was lovely! A big thank you to Keith gavin , he is a fantastic host and did everything…"
5505,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",We really enjoyed our one night stay at the Feathers. We had a great room and the in room catering facilities were excellent. The breakfast was delicious and everything came to the table which made a refreshing change from the normal buffet arrangements. We will definitely be back.
5506,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Great bar, fantastic staff, lovely breakfast, room was really nice but to hot, only way to cool down is to open the window which is a bit inconvenient when the deliveries start at 5am directly outside the window."
5507,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Lovely hotel, situated in the heart of Helmsley. Loved looking at the bric-a-brac and pictures in the restaurant and the corridors. Room spacious and airy. Great selection of coffee and bottled water provided. The toiletries were lovely too. Bed was big and comfortable. Door closer in the corridor outside room 14 needs some attention, door banged every time someone came through. Unfortunately we were seated in the small side room, which seemed to be where they put patrons with dogs. Breakfast was not enjoyable as one of the dogs was a snorting one, who’s owners thought it acceptable to feed sausages on the floor. Sounded disgusting. Must say that the fish in the evening meal was one of the nicest fried fishes that I have had. Staff were exceptional at check in and in the…"
5508,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Stayed for 4 nights on a trip to the Yorkshire Moors. Very good value for money in a good location in the market square. Room was quite compact but very clean with everything you need including coffee maker, kettle with tea, hot chocolate & cookes. Also bottled water provided in room and fresh milk from reception. Nice big shower with toiletries. Breakfast was excellent with a good choice of hot and cold food. Also had 2 evening meals in the bar with the best scampi & chips I've ever had. Parking is a bit tight. We got a space for 3 nights but had to park on a nearby road for the 4th night which wasn't really a problem. Staff so friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel for a trip to the Yorkshire Moors."
5509,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We found the Feathers to be a very friendly hotel in a prime location in Helmsley. The room was very good with a view onto the Market Place, the food was well presented and very good quality and the staff were very friendly and attentive. The only slight disappointment was that the menu was approaching a change and there were not all the selections available. the Specilas list did not make up for this. We have stayed at the Feathers before and it is good t see that the high standards are maintained."
5510,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","My husband and our little dog stayed here this weekend and we had a really wonderful time. The room was large and very clean and the bed was super comfy. There was even a dog bowl, towel, treats and poo bags for the pup, and a ball as a gift which was a lovely touch. The food was fabulous and all the staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. We would highly recommend!"
5511,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",We really enjoyed our stay. The team were very welcoming and made us feel at home. During our stay we had a leak in the bathroom which was immediately dear with and room upgraded and moved within 5 minutes. Great food and great service.
5512,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Popped in for a pre-booked meal on a Tuesday night. Service was fine if a little slow - food was fine but nothing exceptional - drinks were fine - prices a touch high in my opinion. What you get here is reasonable food in a cramped space which although has 'character' is basically dark and a bit dingy. Trying to be a restaurant, hotel and a very noisy public bar all at once and just didn't work in my opinion."
5513,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",Only stayed one night but we had a fabulous room with a beautiful ensuite shower room. Our room had everything you could wish for and very clean and warm. Decor was lovely in our room and throughout the hotel. Staff were friendly and welcoming.
5514,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Perfectly located in the main square, The Feathers offers a taste of history- preserving woodworks by the renowned carpenter (Mouseman) Thompson . The very well-trained staff work as a team and are clearly proud of the heritage. Rooms in the old part are cosy but well equipped, organic toiletries, books, radio, cushions, Lots of thoughtful touches. Very comfortable . Excellent breakfast."
5515,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We had a brilliant stay at the Feathers, lovely hotel with lots of carracter. Mary the receptionist was very helpful and friendly. Our room was very clean, we got fresh milk, which I like for coffee. Chocolate and biscuits and even a lavender spray for your pillow at night. We took a cake for our friend for the meal at night, food was good and the staff very friendly and helpful. Thank you for a lovely stay."
5516,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",We had a 2 night stay at the feathers & found the accommodation to be second to none. Great room in the annex with a huge bed & the place was immaculate. The staff were really accommodating especially Keith & his one liners who couldn’t be more helpful. We will definitely be back
5517,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",We chose The Feathers as it is a good location in Helmsley with access to lots of activities in the area. Staff very helpful and room very comfortable though rather small! Wide menu available for both breakfast and dinner.
5518,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We received a warm welcome here. We had a dog with us, who was also welcomed with a special pack (blanket, water bowl, treats etc) for the room and she was also allowed in various bar/ restaurant areas within the premises, should we have wished to take her. The room was comfortable and well equipped with hairdryer, iron/ board and courtesy tray. We were at the front of the building and had a good view over the market square, but did not suffer from undue traffic noise. The waiting staff were accommodating and we enjoyed 2 good breakfasts. The evening meal was also good, although not all items on the menu were available."
5519,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Feathers. Lovely quaint old coaching inn with excellent staff and really good food. Some of the rooms are a little small but they were adapted to accommodate en suites so this is understandable. Would definitely recommend a stay here in this vibrant market town.
5520,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","First stay at the Feathers - had an enjoyable lunch with friends and then stayed overnight for a business meeting the following day. Lovely, spacious, well appointed bedroom. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Good value."
5521,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We stayed for 3 nights and found the hotel great value for money, very comfortable, the staff delightful, and breakfast excellent. As we were spoiled for choice, we only had dinner in the hotel on one night but it was excellent. We would certainly recommend The Feathers Hotel and intend to return. One point to bear in mind is that parking is limited, and the main square has a 2 hour limit on the stay. Also, the parking charge applies if you have a blue badge."
5522,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","What a wonderful small hotel it is. Although our room was fairly compact and did not have a good view at all, the way it was decorated and prepared was absolutely perfect with great attention to detail. There is literally nothing they haven’t thought of, including a welcome pack for our dog. The staff are so friendly, the food is gorgeous and the service was amazing. We will definitely return and can highly recommend."
5523,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We stayed at the Feathers on Easter Monday for our Ruby wedding anniversary. The guy on reception was extremely friendly and helpful as was all the staff. There was a lovely surprise of a card and bottle of fizz in the room which added to our very pleasant stay. We ate in the restaurant for our evening meal, which was excellent. Our room was in the annexe which was not a problem and was very quiet I would definitely recommend a stay at The Feathers in the beautiful market town of Helmsley."
5524,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","The minute we walked into the hotel we could feel all the stresses of day to day life float away. Despite there always being patrons and staff members milling about the hotel has a serene and calm feel to it. The outdoor/country decor makes the entry halls and corridors feel light, airy and modern whilst the darker wood bar and restaurant areas feel warm and cosy. The jewel in this hotels crown is definitely its team of friendly helpful people. You get greeted with a smile throughout the hotel and nothing is too much for them to help you with. They are all hard workers and seem to love their jobs. Our hotel room (in the annex) was meticulously clean, with the decor maintained to a high standard. The bathroom was luxurious (decent water pressure in the shower), the bedding…"
5525,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We had a superior double room in a separate building at the back of the hotel. It was nicely furnished, comfortable and quiet. Big bathroom with shower and bath. The room no32 was clean but there was a large stain on one of chairs. Not very pleasant. The staff were friendly and efficient. There was one big problem and that was parking our car. There's a private car park and an overflow car park but both are small. After waiting for more than an hour for a vehicle to leave we did manage to park. We were then reluctant to drive anywhere. There's parking on the main square but it's pay and display and a max stay of 2 hours until after 6.30pm. Because of this problem I don't think we will stay at this hotel again. Just to add I realise there's nothing the management can do to…"
5526,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Myself and my husband stayed at The Feathers for a weekend in April 23 to celebrate my husbands birthday. We received a warm welcome from Keith who checked us in. On entering the room there was a card for my husband and a very nice bottle of fizz, a really nice touch. The room was small but spotlessly clean. Nice coffee maker, fresh milk, all you need. We were kindly upgraded in the second night due to me having some medical requirements. I was treated with care, respect and kindness. We had dinner in the hotel both nights, food was outstanding. Super dog friendly, our little dog was able to stay with us in the restaurant etc. I have stayed at all of the hotels in Helmsley previously, they are all of a good standard. The difference for me on this stay was the service, simply…"
5527,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Goodness me I think this was probably the nicest Sunday roast I’ve had for as long as I can remember. Staff incredibly helpful and friendly, the atmosphere was just right and it was cosy and warm. We will definitely be back, thanks everyone in the team for a great lunch experience!"
5528,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Staff are friendly and efficient,I just found service in the public bar a little slow. Enjoyed a lovely meal in the restaurant in the evening, very large portions. The bed was very comfortable and I had an excellent night’s sleep."
5529,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Just had a fantastic breakfast ( superb local ingredients) at the feathers Great hospitality by the Irish duty manager Kieth , really made the morning !! If you are in the area , Bob in ( book before ) and you won’t be disappointed. Many thanks !!!"
5530,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Excellent customer service, friendly staff. Rooms were modern and clean. Bathroom with toiletries, robes and slippers was also spotless. Tea & Coffee facilities. Lovely comfy bed and very quiet room at the back of the Hotel. Little bit tight for parking at the rear of the Hotel. Full English Breakfast was amazing, lovely fresh and not at all greasy. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. Loads of refills of both tea and coffee. Bar area very pleasant. It is a dog friendly hotel , and as such ,I have one small criticism. I would totally not allow them into the dining room /restaurant areas."
5531,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","The hotel is in a good position on the main square, with parking (important in Helmsley). Our room was in the annexe, a good sized room with a comfortable bed and wonderful bath, tastefully furnished including coffee machine. However the walls were thin so we could hear noises from other rooms. The food was ok and the staff were great (including sending us a charger that we had left behind (thank you)."
5532,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Free parking is advertised yet there were no parking spaces available when we arrived Staff were ok, wouldn't organise a taxi for us As with many hotels the kitchen can't cook a fried egg satisfactorily, a little thing but so disappointing"
5533,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",My mum and I have been for 3 meals here in a week and the food and service is excellent. The scampi in batter is particularly good. We would highly recommend it. Thank you for lovely meals and a fantastic service.
5534,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Great place to stay in a quaint old town with excellent proper home cooked food. The puddings are especially good. We had a big room with lovely toiletries. We were in an annexe but it was very quiet. The only thing is a small car park and we had to park in a street the first night. The staff were very helpful in explaining where we could park overnight for free. Breakfast is brought to you at your table in the morning, which we enjoyed instead of having to carry it all. Hope to go back there in the not too distant future."
5535,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Possibly the worst pub food I’ve ever had. Scampi and chips you normally can’t get wrong with, so for £20 I was expecting something special. Alas I got a plate of deep fried food. I had to remove the batter and just eat the tiny scampi inside. My son had a pie which was dry and they only had chips to go with it as only had enough mash potatoes for the sausage meals!! Ridiculous and this was at 5.30! The Thursday before, Easter Bank holiday and they already hadn’t got any items on the menu. Nice staff who sadly I had to say no to the added service charge as I needed to use that money to buy a packet of Gaviscon for the indigestion in the shop next door!"
5536,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Wonderful stay at this gorgeous hotel. All staff are so friendly and helpful. Room was amazing, spotless and bed very comfy. Food in the restaurant last night was great, service was fabulous and all with a smile. Breakfast great this morning, Mary is a credit to this hotel so friendly. We will be back. Thank you so much."
5537,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Comfortable clean room, friendly helpful staff, tasty plentiful breakfast, free on-site parking. Ideally located for exploring Helmsley. Enjoyed searching out the carved mice in the bar. What more could you want?!"
5538,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We stayed here for 2 nights on a Coaching Inn break. We had a nice enough room, but not as good as the one we'd stayed in at another Coaching Inn in Boston a couple of weeks earlier. This meant we couldn't help but compare. The dining menu was quite uninspiring (in contrast to Boston) but fortunately we discovered a little gem - La Trattoria - across the square and so didn't need to dine in the hotel. Breakfast was good, although all served to you, which wouldn't have been a problem if all the offer had been on the menu. The rooms were nice although ours was quite cold and had just about warmed up as we were due to leave. The fresh milk for tea/coffee was also a nice touch. If we'd just been to this hotel i think we would have been quite pleased with it, but after just visiting…"
5539,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",Alway a lovely warm welcome at The Feathers from the reception ladies. They really do ensure you have a good stay. The food is always of a high standard whatever the time of day and a good choice of alcoholic drinks! Beds are always comfy and rooms nicely decorated to a high standard. Can’t wait to return!
5540,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Excellent location, well furnished and decorated, good food and very friendly staff. Well supported bar/pub attached to he hotel made for a perfect break away. Located in the market place and perfect base for walking or travelling to explore the area."
5541,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",Return visit having stayed here pre covid. Quirky old buildings with lots of charm and character. Lots of mice too but thankfully the wooden trademark of the Mouseman who made and fitted a lot of the fittings. Food was very good and all the staff provided a high standard of customer service. Standard bedrooms are compact but are comfortable and very clean.
5542,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","From start to finish the experience was excellent. Lovely, friendly and helpful staff. The Feathers is definitely a feather in the cap of the coaching inn group. Will definitely have a return visit when staying in Helmsley again. Great place to stay for dogs as super dog friendly."
5543,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",We had a very nice couple of nights. The accommodation is in s lovely location. The only reason I gave a low score on sleeping was the traffic noise as we stayed at the front of the building and the windows could do with secondary glazing to reduce noise. Otherwise spot on.
5544,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley",Really enjoyed our visit to the Feathers Hotel. The room was spacious and there was everything we needed. There was also a bottle of prosecco in our room as we were visiting for my husband's birthday. The only issue was a leaking coffee machine and the fact that there was a limited menu due to unplanned kitchen work although I appreciate it was outside the hotel's control. They even posted the dog lead back to us which we left - thank you
5545,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We stayed here last night after spending the previous night in Harrogate. The Feathers Hotel is in a prime location, with free parking at the rear, the staff especially Mary were great, the hotel is very well presented inside and has a vibrant atmosphere, our room was very clean and modern and Helmsley is a stunning village,very peaceful and has some great shops, cafes, bars etc, I'd definitely come back to Helmsley again and I'd definitely stay at The Feathers Hotel again!"
5546,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","Found this one of the friendliest hotels we’ve stayed in.From check-in with Tracey, to checking out with Mary and everything in between, had a wonderful mini break.Room was spacious,equipped with everything we needed.Used the restaurant for the 2 nights we were there, good food.Breakfast was good, recommend the eggs Benedict,cooked to perfection.All staff that we met were very friendly and worked well as a team and had a good rapport with each other.Can’t wait to come back."
5547,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","The Feathers is located centrally on the main square. There are lots of independent shops within a few yards selling good quality food items and gifts etc. The hotel has a small carport which operates on a first come first served basis. We were able to park in a nearby street. We received a warm welcome and generally found the staff to be helpful and very friendly. Our room had a view of the square. It was well equipped with an iron, hairdryer, tea and coffee of very good quality, biscuits etc. The decor is OK but nit particularly new though the bathroom looked fairly newly decorated and everything was very clean. Some of the decor could probably do with sprucing up but it didn't bother us at all. There was some clanking from the local market on one day fairly early which was…"
5548,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","A group of 8 of us had a wonderful stay at this lovely property, only issue we had was the people in anpther room making noise at 04.30, not the hotels fault at all and they spoke to the people concerned. Overall a wonderful time and lovely food and drink. Well recommended."
5549,"The Feathers Hotel, Helmsley","We stayed 1 night in room 33, a room in a converted house , behind the main building. The staff are friendly and helpful, a quick check in, even changed our room as I requested a bath! The room was clean, (slight damp around the shower) and well equipped, good coffee and teas, nice toiletries including a yellow duck! Breakfast was served efficiently by friendly waiters, a real nice full English. We hope to stay again."
5550,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Unbelievably perfect location for walking and shopping. Nice staff. Lovely room. Good gym, with weights and space. Just a great place to be and stay to enjoy a vacation in London. Would definitely return."
5551,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Need some serious service improvements - staff seems not to know they work in a 5 star hotel Location is very good, close to Piccadilly Square and West End Interior is nice although some rooms a bit under 5 stars this hotel has ( tv in the closet?) Very good breakfast"
5552,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",Nice location in the central of London Nice breakfast Average rooms The reception service Is in general poor and not at all like a 5 star hotel. Even the check-in and the check-out proces was close to horrible
5553,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Can't recommend this hotel enough. The location is absolutely perfect to be in the heart of tourist attractions. Using the hotel app is an easy way to check in and pick your preferred room. Less than 5 minutes walk from Leicester Square tube station and situated among shops, park, cinemas and so much more. Staff on front desk are a credit to Radisson hotels. Each person we spoke to were friendly and helpful. All seemed very happy to chat and they clearly enjoy their jobs. I requested a room at the front with a view and it was perfect. I thought it may have been noisy but actually heard nothing! Room was a good size with a small 'passage' leading into the bedroom. Plenty of storage, fridge, decent coffee and comfortable bed. Toiletries were lovely and everywhere was spotlessly…"
5554,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Stayed here for 2 nights, staff friendly welcoming and helpful . Location is fantastic. Breakfast is set out lovely and fresh and staff were really good. The bathroom and room was spacious and clean, the shower was a tad on the slow side. Decor is a little outdated in the room. Overall we loved our stay and would definitely go back."
5555,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Hotel is moreorless shut downstairs on a Tuesday which for a hotel I was shocked about. No bar area, no restaurant just a small seated area for guests to drink at. In the end I took room service but from an overall hotel experience this was not good enough for the price I paid."
5556,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","No better service or place to stay, if you don’t mind hard and a bit too small double beds. But the competence at the reception and the friendlyness and kindness of most of the people working there is hard to beat!"
5557,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","The hotel was amazing, and the room overlooked Leicester Square and was immaculate. The bed was huge and very comfortable. All staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. Definitely be staying again."
5558,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Travelled with adult family members to celebrate a birthday at the Royal Opera House. This hotel is in a wonderful location, staff are superb, food and service outstanding. Downsides are that the windows don’t open in the bedrooms - madness, stuffy and a definite lack of oxygen. I don’t like to think of the rooms not being aired between guests either. Another disappointing feature was that the cups, glasses and teaspoons in the rooms are all individually wrapped in plastic which absolutely shouldn’t be happening."
5559,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Hi, Excellent hotel, in an excellent location (You can circle all the important sites in London by walk), warm and spacious room (Premium square view room). The breakfast is very good, the sitting area is pleasant, aesthetic and interesting. Every evening turns into a bar. The dining room staff provides excellent and courteous service. Thanks to Sonia, Aka and the rest of the team. At the reception desk, everyone is very kind and helpful. Concierge's name is Daniel and he is excellent. In conclusion, we had a great time. Anat and Itzhac"
5560,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",Very central for sightseeing Fortnam & Mason 5 min walk away underground station 5 mins away rooms very clean & comfortable lots of bars and restaurants on doorstep breakfast very good staff amazing Well worth the cost
5561,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","I have stayed in many hotels in London and this is the best hotel for location. A short walk from a couple of tube stations and you have restaurants, bars and shops on the doorstep. However, this was unfortunately one of the worst rooms I have stayed in. Unbelievably dated and a real cold feel because of the old furnishings. The room was clean, however, i was shocked when I went opened my room door, having seen how modern and welcoming the reception area was. Be wary of what room you book, as mine looked absolutely nothing like the images kn here. For that reason, I wouldnt stay here again."
5562,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","We needed to come to London on a business trip. Our first choice of hotel was full, so we booked into the Radisson Hampshire Hotel. I was a bit worried the hotel might be noisy as it is in Leicester Square, but my room faced the back, which meant I didn't have much of a view, but at least it was quiet. This hotel is quite an old building, so had some limitations, but my room was very clean, the staff were generally helpful and the breakfast (included in our rate) was excellent. Would stay here again."
5563,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","very nice hotel and the location is great, friendly staff, and the staff in the lobby are very helpful and happy in their work. I would choose this hotel again and hopefully I will be back with my friends or my family"
5564,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",Great location on Leceister Square. Nicely appointed rooms although a bit small. Perfect for downtown attractions and theatre visits. Lots of cafes near by. Noisy in evening but very quiet over night. Would stay again.
5565,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Didn't go for the cheapest option but the room felt like the cheapest one there. Was expecting a desk to work from and a slightly bigger room to feel a bit closer to the price we paid. We did speak to reception about it but, lovely as they were, they assured we were in the correct level of room and they had no other rooms to transfer us."
5566,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Hotel is right inside the ""Time Square"" area of London! Beds were so comfortable and room so clean, Staff was extremely attentive too! The room had everything one needed - fridge, iron, blow dryer, shampoo, coffee machine, etc. Was kind of sad I didn't get to spend more time in the hotel since it was so nice - but so much to see in London!"
5567,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",Excellent central location for a long weekend in London. Room was a good size. Bed was a good size and very comfortable - exactly what was needed after long days of sight-seeing. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Even to the point of providing umbrellas for the London rain!
5568,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Enjoyed our stay here very much. Staff and services are professional and very accommodating. Food was very good and service excellent. We would definitely stay here again. My only ""negative"" would be location. The hotel is quite a distance from most attractions except in the theater district."
5569,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Superb location for theatreland. Staff friendly, relaxed and efficient; special mention to Sonia who looked after us at breakfast. Any requests promptly dealt with. Slept really well given Leicester Square location. Room well maintained and provisions regularly replenished. (Preston, Lancashire)."
5570,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","We really enjoyed our stay. Welcome was excellent, room was spacious with high standard bathroom facilities and generous supply of shampoo, conditioner, soap etc. breakfast was a very high standard and we looked forward to it each morning."
5571,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Their check in system allows you to choose the room, like a seat on a plane, which is great. They sent me a confirmation for room 121 which was for my sons, teenagers. When they arrived the manager changed the room and they were assigned and old dirty small room, with fungus in the bathroom. They just took the chance to cheat on two boys, it is a shame, I have never seen such a miserable attitude in my life. The manager screamed and turned our conversation into a marginal neighbor’s argument. She said she could not take any action, even while being the manager, with an outrageous lack of manners. The restaurants don´t offer room service at night. The place is a hole. Don´t let them take your money."
5572,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London. To being the location is ideal. There is a lot to do within walking distance and it is also very close to a tube station to travel further afield. When we arrived at the hotel we were very early and we were able to leave our bags at reception and go out for a bit luggage free! We checked in suing the virtual check in and this then meant we got a text when our room was ready. Our room was ready a few hours before official check in so this was a bonus. The room itself was spacious and clean and had great views of Leicester Square. With the room facing Leicester Square you could think it would be noisy as it is a busy area however the room was very quiet. We slept well in the room. The bed was large and…
5573,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Avoid this average hotel, had a technical difficulty with bank and was harassed by email and phone, zero reply to my follow up call and email about the matter. Regular customer for over 20 years. Dreadful. Used to be fantastic. Won’t return here again or any other of their London properties (The Mayfair for example) which I use 2-3 to times a month for dinner and drinks with friends."
5574,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","excellent hotel, great location with lots to do right on the doorstep. Friendly and helpful staff. Lovely room, tasteful decoration and a nice choice of good facilities. Breakfast was tasty, plenty of choice."
5575,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","As a regular traveller to London I'm so glad I discovered this beauty of a hotel in the heart of theatreland! The staff were incredibly attentive, from the bar staff to the concierge - nothing was too much bother. I don't feel as though I can even explain how wonderful the room was, in prime position overlooking Leicester Square through a delightful deco window with the most comfortable bed I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. As a frequent traveller a good bed makes all the difference, the pillows were amazing and I'd quite like some for myself! There was a coffee machine and kettle in the room with fresh bottled water too. The room was kept immaculate while we were there and the cleaners were invisible! No rattling trolleys in the corridors, like a cleaning fairy had…"
5576,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Excellent location, near to tube. A lot of visitor attractions within walking distance, good selection of restaurants on doorstep. Close to theatres. Hotel décor was lovely, beautiful room, which had been upgraded"
5577,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","We wanted to book a nice hotel for an anniversary trip to London as a base to go and see Phantom. The Radisson Blu had a large, comfortable room with good amenities, very helpful staff, a great view over Leicester Square, and was very conveniently located for theatres, the West End, museums, Chinatown, etc. We really enjoyed our stay."
5578,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Ticked all the boxes - very clean facilities, friendly staff in a ideal location very central for all attractions. We would definitely return on our next trip to London. All in - Great value for money."
5579,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","We had always wanted to return after spending a romantic few days there a few yrs ago. The position is just wonderful as you are right in the middle of Leicester Square and not far from Covent gardens. We asked to change rooms as the first was not at all great (you could not even open the fridge as the door hit the bed). A friendly receptionist showed me another that was twice the size and we took it even though you could not open a window. All staff were friendly, bed linen expensive and comfortable. We may go back again."
5580,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Great 4 days in this fine Hotel. The staff was really doing everything the can to make our stay a pleasant one. The rooms traditional English with super housecleaning. Specially thanking the breakfast brigate for their efforts and service. What a great feeling they give You at that moment. Sonia did everything for us and nothing was too much, many thanks.The frontdesk was very kind and helpful and gave us the feeling of coming home. We certainly come back."
5581,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","I would almost give my stay a ten out of ten. Location and the service were both easily ten. The breakfast was a wonderful start to my day. Excellent service and food choices, probably the best I have ever experienced at a hotel, and I am 67 and have travelled all over the world. One evening I even tested a negroni at the bar and it was lovely, much better than any standard negroni. There were only a few minus points. In general the bathroom was great, however, I took a bath and had a bit of a hard time getting out. It was narrow and the hand grips were a little too far away or placed wrong for me. It meant that I only took showers after that. I spent most of my day walking around London and retired to the room by about 20:00. I turned on the TV, but the selections were very…"
5582,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Very poor quality room , very tired, poor quality bed and pillows, carpets are worn and thread bare in places Charged twice for a room at £450 per night and illegally obtained money without consent on credit card"
5583,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Made very welcome by all members of staff, without being intruding. Lovely gesture of chocolate sign written plates to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday, and rose petals over the bed, Happy Anniversary."
5584,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Excellent staff , great location.. we will definitely stay here again in the future . The staff went above and beyond and made our stay very special. The room was spacious with a comfortable bed. A great hotel and location."
5585,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","When we checked in Abdul and Ty received us very warmly. The room attendant Alicia is highly effective. The staff in the restaurant is kind and flexible. The hotel is located near the central area so is very comfortable to walk around everywhere. The only bad thing, but not related to the hotel is that we were picked pocket by Picadilly circus, so if you are around here pay a lot of attention in your stuff."
5586,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","The room.....where to start wall paper coming away from the wall, badly chipped inside wardrobe everything very BROWN and no mini bar just an empty fridge making it more Premier Inn than 5 star. I have the photos as it was so poor."
5587,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",We had checked in online thinking this would save time at check in. Process was still slow and took a while even though we had answered all questions online. The room itself was fine - there was a lack of amenities and needed some TLC. The water was piping hot in the showers and bath - be careful if you have young children. The temperature itself in the hotel was far too warm - we struggled to sleep even putting the temperate on the lowest setting possible. Breakfast was average too - nothing special at all Check out took ages - not helped by the fact that they tried to overcharge us by £200 and didn’t apologise - in fact they tried to argue we were wrong. Fortunately for us we had an email which proved the rate. We spoke to the lobby manager who did not care even…
5588,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Great location for Central soho, Bath tap running too hot, would be carefull if had children, was OK for a single night stay, breakfast was lovely, staff were great, no other issues with stay, thanks again"
5589,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","I have stayed here a number of times over the years - but not since COvid. It still has great staff and service. At this time of the year the dining room is closed on a Monday and Tuesday (other than for breakfast) and the lounge alone is somewhat small for a lot of residents. Of course there are pubs and restaurants galore nearby The furnishings are a little dated but you can’t beat the service, cleanliness and location"
5590,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",The hotel is situated bang in the middle of Leicester Square. Perfect location. A smallish hotel. Have stayed here in the past but this time I have to say that it was not as good as last time. The rooms really need a revamp. It’s old and hasn’t seen a coat of paint for a while. Shame as my previous visit was excellent. I’m sure once it’s had a revamp things will be different. Staff are very obliging and kind and do go above and beyond.
5591,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","What a hidden gem in a busy location, I visited the hotel with my family, i honestly could not fault the hotel on one thing, location, standard of accommodation, value for money, breakfast. The entire experience was wonderful and after a few dodgy rooms in London on previous visits this is one hotel I will recommend and return to again and again"
5592,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","WE had arranged to stay here for the weekend but unfortunately due to a family member falling ill we had to leave early, staff were great helping us with a quick checkout. Breakfast was wonderful and our suite was beautiful. Cant wait to stay again. Location is fantastic - little tip park in China Town q park if driving literally 2 mins walk."
5593,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","The hotel is excellent. Our room was clean and well arranged. The location is simply fantastic. We had drinks in the bar and were surprised how much we enjoyed it. We typically avoid hotel bars, but the hotel staff, as well as the layout and music made the difference. We had a fantastic time and definitely would not hesitate to return."
5594,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","We got a good price by booking direct with the hotel. The location was fantastic for getting around the main attractions. We had been upgraded to a suite which was spacious, clean, quiet and the bed comfortable."
5595,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London",Standard does not match the price. The offer you will get about spending some money freely at the hotel is nothing but a joke. They will try to avoid giving you anything of value - bad wine and tap water!
5596,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Meeting room four was well equipped, laid out and presented well and breakfast provided was excellent. The staff were extremely helpful and we will return for meetings in the future. I tried several other hotels in the area but the Radisson was by far the better choice."
5597,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Would highly recommend and will definitely visit again. All the staff were amazing, so helpful and knowledgeable. Food was fantastic and the cleanliness was of a high standard. Location was perfect and easy distance to walk to theatre, London eye, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace. Special mention the the concierge gentlemen who went above and beyond for us, thank you!"
5598,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Had a great weekend at the radisson blu was looked after from the moment we arrived, lovely clean room, great night's sleep followed by a first class breakfast. Would definitely stay again loved every minute."
5599,"Radisson Blu Edwardian Hampshire Hotel, London","Great central location. Room with a view of Leicester Square, very large comfortable bed, amazing shower in well appointed bathroom. The bar area was welcoming, The breakfast a real highlight, Sonia and the other staff all very efficient. Will definitely stay again."
5600,The Regent Hotel,"The hotel is in a great location with good rooms, service and breakfasts. The sausages and also the porridge were great. Staff were friendly and helpful. The evening meals were ok but could be improved. Perhaps the pub grub section of the menu was better than the more “ambitious” choices of pheasant or beef bourginon."
5601,The Regent Hotel,"Just returned from a mid week stay at the Regent. Could not fault this hotel in anyway, we had a fab time and will definitely return. Staff could but do enough for you to make your stay perfect. The food was top notch and worth every ££."
5602,The Regent Hotel,"Thank you for a most enjoyable stay, my wife and I were at the hotel many years ago on our honeymoon and this was our first return to the lake district. we had a very enjoyable stay, the food was excellent in the restaurant and the hotel was cozy given how cold the weather was"
5603,The Regent Hotel,"Restaurant inconsistent quality otherwise really nice Hotel in great location , nice and very comfortable rooms. Meals and bar a little expensive but understandable with current times and high energy costs"
5604,The Regent Hotel,"Friendly, helpful staff serving first class food. Dog friendly, in an excellent location. Couldn't ask for anything better. The drinks are a little expensive but not too outrageous. The bedrooms are quite large and very comfortable."
5605,The Regent Hotel,"Stayed for business so just 1 night, but it was great. Real christmassy vibe, beautiful location and very clean. Breakfast was really nice, dinner was okay too. Overall would recommend and will be going back"
5606,The Regent Hotel,"Not our original choice as we were booked in to the Waterhead Hotel, but were moved to the Regent as the Waterhead was closed for refurbishment but The Regent is still an excellent choice if you have a four legged friend travelling with you. Very dog friendly! Excellent location, right beside Lake Windermere and quite central for visiting the Lake District. Generally we found the choice of food to be quite good but somewhat limited if you are staying more than a couple of nights."
5607,The Regent Hotel,Stayed last night should of been there tonight but had to Leave due to personal issue. Great place lovely and clean and great food and even better staff. Breakfast was amazing. Service was great. I honestly loved the place and the staff I felt welcomed
5608,The Regent Hotel,Oh my what more can we say about our stay we arrived fri afternoon at this fab hotel we were welcomed warmly by chris and Julie on reception fantastic. We were given room 44 across the carpark lovely room the best in fact the furnishings were first class the room wow and a view of the lake Thankyou to Glenda also please let Glenda know at central booking that she’s an absolute gem in arranging this it was just what we needed so opted for a 2nd night same room we didn’t want to leave this amazing establishment and a shout out to bryn and ange also for being amazing hosts we carnt wait to return Tina and Pete Boardman.
5609,The Regent Hotel,"Stayed at the Regent for a midweek break with our pooch. Our room was excellent. Very clean, comfy bed and great shower and even a water bowl for our four-legged friend. The food in the hotel was excellent and the staff were very welcoming and very helpful. We can't wait to stay again. Sasha says hello and thank you for being so dog friendly"
5610,The Regent Hotel,Having stayed at the Regent twice before we were really looking forward to returning for a short break. We were therefore very disappointed to find the new owners had introduced a much more basic approach. As mentioned by other reviewers this is not a hotel now it is a pub with rooms. Ambleside has indeed lost a wonderful hotel and gained a pub. The main disappointment was the casual and inexperienced staff who appeared to lack management. The Regent is in a wonderfull location but I doubt we would return.
5611,The Regent Hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions. It is in a lovely setting on the lake and an easy level walk into Ambleside. It also has dog friendly rooms, which although across a small courtyard, have a covered walkway. There is a great selection for breakfast, and this comes freshly cooked rather than a buffet which has been say out for hours. Some of the rooms could perhaps do with being redecorated, but they have everything you need, including toiletries, hairdryer, iron, tea and coffee etc. The staff are also friendly and helpful."
5612,The Regent Hotel,What a lovely hotel great views of Lake Windermere and 1 minute walk to Lake side The hotel is well done out and clean the rooms are very nice and the staff are very friendly The restaurant is really nice the food is great and service is to Well worth a stay
5613,The Regent Hotel,"After covid and family illnes we returned to our special place where we have celebrated our wedding anniversary for 15years to find out hotel had changed owners.We always book the sail loft a fantastic room with balcony overlooking the lake alot different no robes, telephone missing no cd and TV ariel taped up with brown parcel tape.Normaly we would go across the road to another beautiful hotel to find it closed and under reference being taken over .by same company.Breckfast was always locally sourced products what a let down not a great selection and quality very poor.Hotel lacks atmosphere and staff are very inexperienced.My husband always has flowers and champagne in room ready he had the order his own flowes as hotel don't do it any more they also forgot the champagne …"
5614,The Regent Hotel,"The hotel is a stone throw across the road from Lake Windermere, it had plenty of car parking and the staff were friendly and helpful. We ate in the restaurant and it was the first night of the new menu. The menu had a good choice and the food was lovely, we also had a drink in the bar afterwards, which was busy. The room we stayed in could do with a bit of updating, but the bed was comfortable and the room was spacious and clean. Tea, coffee and milk was provided in the room with shower gel and shampoo in the bathroom. The bathroom had both a bath and a separate shower which was good. Ambleside centre is walkable from the hotel and there are plenty of places to eat and drink. We would definitely stay here again."
5615,The Regent Hotel,Very good location but the hotel i believe is awaiting a refurbishment. Drink choice limited and breakfast average regarding quality. Room had the basic facilities and the bathroom was fine but the room in general needs an update for the price you pay. Good parking at the back of the hotel.
5616,The Regent Hotel,"Enjoyed a lovely family lunch in The Deck. Great fish and chips, scampi and burgers. All happy. Children’s menu available & good selection of food for children. Standard prices for Lake District. Warm and cosy. Staff friendly. Lots of spaces available for meals."
5617,The Regent Hotel,"Very enjoyable 1 night stay in this beautiful area. large superior double room. very large comfortable bed. modern clean bathroom. Down side bedroom window faced the car park. We didnt eat there but breakfast they just need to keep up with demand for coffee, bowls, bread, butter etc. Friendly staff. Would recommend and stay again. Good out door areas."
5618,The Regent Hotel,"This is an incredibly expensive hotel, for what you get. We paid £269 for a superior double, to find that it wasn't that much different from a good Travelodge hotel. No fridge either. The restaurant was also massively overpriced, £17 for a steak and kidney pie. Overall this was not value for money."
5619,The Regent Hotel,"The Regent hotel was fantastic in every way, the food, The service and the hotel room were amazing (We even had a lake view) Amazing place, The staff were fantastic and very welcoming. We would fully recommend the Regent Hotel Thanks"
5620,The Regent Hotel,"Having previously stayed at this hotel we were dismayed at the changes. Gone is the hotel with restaurant experience, welcome now to the pub with a room experience. On our visit our room was fine but food wise in the evening the menu was poor and food not great and didn't like the more casual set up, although breakfast was acceptable. Did not enjoy the staff setting up for breakfast in the bar in the evening whilst trying to have a quiet drink. Ambleside has gained another pub and lost a nice hotel."
5621,The Regent Hotel,A lot of huffs puffs and eye rolling. This was by far the worst service we’ve received at this hotel and this was our 5th stay!!! Staff were quite rude. It wouldn’t put us of returning as previous stays have been 5* service. Quite disappointing to say the least.
5622,The Regent Hotel,An average hotel that was close to the lake but a distance from Ambleside centre. Staff pleasant and helpful Nice outside bar area serving snack food Expensive for the size of room but I guess that's because its the Lake District
5623,The Regent Hotel,"Great location at head of lake plus ample, safe and accessible parking gets you off to a great start. No complaints about room and facilities-bathroom, tea/coffee maker etc. Clean and comfortable. Good choice and quality of cooked breakfast and in evening dinner. Breakfast buffet needs a rethink but the cooked breakfast makes up for it."
5624,The Regent Hotel,This is no way a 4* hotel. It is more a 3*. Choice of food and drinks poor. I feel sorry for the staff as they try very hard under difficult circumstances. Other couples we spoke to were of the same opinion.
5625,The Regent Hotel,"The family room is spacious, clean and cosy. We really appreciate the sitting area for our family time at night. Windermere Lake is situated right across the hotel and there are free parking lots provided. The breakfast is delicious and sufficient."
5626,The Regent Hotel,We were in room 20 it was dark facedthe car park smelt of damp. Location near the lake was fab reception looked fab but thats where it ended for us. Breakfast was ok but not enough choice no fresh fruit apart from prunes and grapefruit. Staff were nice and helpful. To add insult to injury I found somebody elses dirty socks yuk
5627,The Regent Hotel,Just returned from a lovely week end break for my birthday with hubby. Room was perfect with lake view. 😍 Staff were friendly and helpful. Lovely location we normally stay in bowness so this was a nice change of scenery. Breakfast was lovely -help your self cereal tea coffee toast etc. But your main breakfast was served by staff after placing your order so was nice as not a free for a all. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ would highly recommend and would return again
5628,The Regent Hotel,"Actually a really lovely location unfortunately let down by the staff. We arrived before our 3pm check in time and our room was ready so we’re able to head up. Check in was a little unprofessional the with no one seemingly in charge. It wasn’t explained that the doors would be locked at a certain time so we would need to use the extra key and which way to go. The room was ok, clean and tidy but would have been improved with some bottled water. Breakfast unfortunately was like a scene from faulty towers. One young man on his own trying to manage the restaurant. He did his best but unfortunately he was unable to take control. There was no direction on what guests should do. No cutlery on tables, no plates for toast and heaven forbid you ask the older gentleman with the beard who…"
5629,The Regent Hotel,"Just returned Have stayed many times at the Regent So have seen a lot of changes Some good, some not so good. Stayed in upstairs lake view room, could not fault this room but do know that these rooms are the newest rooms in the Hotel, it had lovely View of the lake with opening Juliet balcony. Clean, well equipped, Comfortable bed, Ok Wifi, Tea and Coffee, but no clock. Air conditioning worked fine, but a little noisy did find it a little difficult to understand how to turn on and off, instructions would be a benefit, Over shower bath not a walk-in shower, and Toiletries, There is now no everyday room cleaning service (don’t Know if this cut backs or May be staff shortage ) did not bother us as only there for 2 Day. If you wish to have Room Cleaning Service, towels etc,…"
5630,The Regent Hotel,"Extremely enjoyable stay , couldn't fault anything . Room was clean and spacious , air conditioning was an added bonus.Bed extremely comfortable . All staff were friendly and approachable.Will definitely return soon"
5631,The Regent Hotel,"Lovely individual hotel. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Great location and good choice of food and drink. The room was fantastic and was enhanced by a great view of Lake Windermere. I cannot fault this hotel, for facilities, location and standard of accommodation."
5632,The Regent Hotel,"We stayed for 5 nights, we had one of the lake view rooms (room 38) and it was beautiful. Our adult kids gifted us the break for our Christmas and it was booked before the hotel changed hands. Our room was well appointed, had everything we needed for our time there and was clean, modern and comfortable. Staff were lovely and friendly throughout our stay and made us feel very welcome. Communal areas were well appointed and clean. It looked freshly decorated throughout. The outdoor bar area overlooked the lake too. Just 2 minutes from the piers for the Windermere cruises and an easy 15 minute walk from the centre of Ambleside. Although our breakfast was included we only ate it 3 days as we're not really breakfast people, the full cooked was generous, other options were limited but…"
5633,The Regent Hotel,"What a delightful surprise. Delicious food, Angus beef burgers and chicken burgers are highly recommended. The most friendly staff we have experienced in a very long time, thank you Olly, Liz, Jade, Francesco. Staff were brilliant with the dog as well as us. Would definitely love to come again."
5634,The Regent Hotel,Good hotel. Food not as good as under the Hewitt family. Specials often repeated. Overall good for a short break. Rooms good and clean. Staff friendly and helpful. Were lucky the weather was excellent.
5635,The Regent Hotel,"Excellent hotel in a very good location close to Ambleside pier for taking the steamer to Bowness. It is also very easy to visit Grasmere, Coniston and Hawkshead. There is ample parking space to the rear and a number of small lounges to relax in the hotel. We found ALL the staff polite and attentive and the food was freshly cooked at both breakfast and evening meal ( evening is optional )."
5636,The Regent Hotel,"Great hotel, dog friendly which was one of our reasons for staying, nice room, pleasant staff, and good food with a nice outside shaded area,ideal location for boat trips, or a short walk into Ambleside Would recommend"
5637,The Regent Hotel,"This is our second stay at this Jewel of a hotel. Situated at waterhead a mile from the town Center. It was nice to see how this hotel has progressed. I don’t write many reviews as I stay at so many hotels because of work but I decided to bring my family. We stayed in room 31, quaint suite of a double and separate twin room for the sprogs . The food was amazing , we ate 2 nights , wood fire pizza on the terrace cooked fresh was awesome so the kids said. Second night in the restaurant as the weather was a bit wet. The hotel had just been taken over when we stayed last and gas gone from strength to strength. The staff are a credit to the new owners. Sarah, Richard, amigo Pedro, pizza Lofty to name a few of so many wonderful people made my family break so memorable., especially…"
5638,The Regent Hotel,"Fantastic from start to finish, staff very friendly and helpful, room lovely and comfortable bed, air conditioning was a godsend due to the heatwave, loads to choose from at breakfast time and would recommend to eat at the restaurant within the hotel..steak and ale pie was to die for! Location couldn’t of been any better, we really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend to people, and would stay here again, thank you for making our trip so nice and making us feel very welcome..Tracy and Scott"
5639,The Regent Hotel,"This hotel is excellent,we would recommend it to everyone. Lovely location, rooms were very nice, breakfast was lovely and staff were so welcoming and friendly!! We would love to visit again! Hotel was very quiet also!"
5640,The Regent Hotel,"We had a fantastic stay here, it’s right by the ferry terminal & about a 15 min walk into the centre of Ambleside, our room was one of the dog friendly ones, it was spotless & so fresh & airy, the bed was so comfortable bathroom was great & shower was good, We had dinner on our 1st night & it was fabulous the steak & ale pie was delicious, Breakfast was great, with lots of choice, & all cooked beautifully, The best thing about this hotel are the staff, they are super friendly, attentive & so helpful We had the best service, from Richard, Liz & David, & the rest of the restaurant & bar staff, We will definitely be staying here again, Thank you for a lovely stay 😘"
5641,The Regent Hotel,Booked room with a dog to be told not allowed but website allowed me to book it. Downgraded to what I can only describe a accommodation from Bates Motel - shocking experience - declined the room and requested a refund but had to ring central reservations to request this - shown receptionist that the website allow you to book these rooms with a dog as you pay extra and the room description does not have any restrictions on it
5642,The Regent Hotel,"Hi I previously booked the accommodation for Friday 15th July but had to change the date to the 22nd for personal reasons. Unfortunately the price increased from £199 on the 15th to £269 which is unjustified, we stayed in room 43 which felt cramped and had a small double bed and the wardrobe door was falling off which was dangerous. The following morning we went down for breakfast and found the service and food was disappointing, my wife asked for poached eggs on toast, when it arrived it was one lonely overcooked egg on a piece of toast. We left the hotel on Saturday feeling that we had been overcharged for the whole experience at the Regent Hotel by the lake."
5643,The Regent Hotel,"Stayed 3 times previously - standard rooms were great, very clean, really good service. Paid extra for superior room this time, room 30, nothing superior about it - stains from ceiling painted over in different colour in multiple places, shabby & stained sofa, shower screen pulling off tiles, broken pictures plus generally not clean, very disappointed. Breakfast not good at all - cold, greasy, sausage not cooked through. Staff doing as good as possible but understaffed. Room service was on request and go to reception for milk, toilet rolls, etc. Bed comfy but needed new pillows."
5644,The Regent Hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel before and enjoyed are stay. The room at the time, which was just before the second lockdown was lovely and clean. The food in the restaurant was very nice and breakfast was great. Especially the as they didnt finish service till midday. The staff were also very friendly. On this this visit it was more than disappointing. We chose to pay more for a better room. The room we were give was out side the court yard. Very dark and drab room. The furniture had seen better days and since we had paid a bit more i didnt expect to see a shower curtain with mold on it. We asked for a change of room which we were given. Its was outside next to the car park I think they call them the garden rooms. On first impressions and walking up to the room we thought…"
5645,The Regent Hotel,"We had a pleasant stay with none of the issues described in some of the negative reviews posted here. Our room was large, at the front overlooking the road with no view but nonetheless reasonably quiet. Everywhere was clean; there was lots of hot water with a bonus of both a bath and walk in shower. The bed was large and comfortable and the air conditioning a bonus we didn't need to use very much. We rejected the restaurant for dinner because the menu was too limited for our needs and found good alternatives locally but breakfast, although limited, was sufficient in quality and quantity. There were some delays in replenishing stocks but a word in the right place resolved any issue quickly. Staff were generally friendly and helpful. I can't really judge value as everything has…"
5646,The Regent Hotel,"Location and staff good, The room in the courtyard was clean but in the car park so heard all the comings and goings of cars, the walls are paper thin and you could quite easily hear the other tvs on and people speaking. The bed was so uncomfortable that every part of me that touched it ached in the morning, I've slept on more comfortable floors. We went to the 22 restaurant, the menu is very limited and what we did have was awful, we went for breakfast to see if they could redeem themselves and as the que was out of the door we decided to leave and just put it down to a bad experience. In all would we stay there again.....NEVER!!!!!!!!!!"
5647,The Regent Hotel,"Excellent location. 10/15 minute walk from Ambleside village. Across the road from the lake where there is plenty to do, we hired a boat with our dog for an hour. Arrived too early to check in but we’re still able to leave the car in the car park and explore before coming back later to check in. Staff are really friendly. Dogs are welcome anywhere except the main dining area which is fine because you can eat/drink at the bar and lounge area which personally I preferred! The rooms are really nice, spacious and clean. Dog bowl is provided. Breakfast was lovely. Great value for money. Would definitely return and recommend!"
5648,The Regent Hotel,a short stay here due to diversions on our way. we arrived at 11.45 p.m. and the receptionist was very helpful checking us in speedily. had a great nights sleep here .and 7.30 am came around far too quickly. breakfast was average and met the basic needs considering another days walk ahead. clean room and gorgeous location.
5649,The Regent Hotel,"The staff were lovely and did their very best to provide a good service but this hotel was suffering resource issues. This was evident as the cleaning and room service wasn't great. Also, don't stay in room 29 if you want a good night's sleep. It's next to a maintenance/ boiler?? room."
5650,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Stayed here with family on London holiday. Interconnecting rooms were perfect with a mix of teens & younger kids, 2 double beds in one room & double & single in other. Plenty of fresh towels, comfortable beds & complimentary toiletries. Buffet breakfast great with plenty of freshly cooked food & the automatic pancake machine was a big hit with the younger kids! Staff helpful & friendly. Location easy to get into central London with either bus or train service on the doorstep."
5651,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"One of the best chain hotels we've stayed in. We booked the Doubletree at fairly short notice for a 2-day trip to London, and based largely on the very positive reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The Hilton app let us pick in advance the exact room we wanted, and the check-in process was seamless. Our room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. The shower was excellent. The breakfast buffet was great, with a wide choice of hot and cold dishes. The location is a wee bit out of things as it's near a relatively quiet part of the Thames. However there are nice walks along the river, and plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. All of the staff were lovely, really friendly and helpful. On our departure day we were struggling to book…"
5652,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Nice clean hotel with friendly, efficient staff. Room was spacious and bed very comfortable. Very close to Imperial Wharf station which gives you easy access to central London. Quiet location so perfect for a relaxing stay. Cookies on arrival a nice touch"
5653,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"The room was clean, newly renovated, and in the size of a typical Doubletree room. We had a double bed and a single bed in one room (travelling with one teenager). There was plenty of room. The breakfasts were good. The hotel is near the Uberboats, which I would recommend using to get into the main locations in London (check the schedules for the RB6 to plan). But what stands out most here is the professional and extremely courteous staff. The manager was busting breakfast tables working hard and still always pleasant. Harris - a front desk receptionist - went out of his way to be helpful. And the rest of the staff was very professional. I would recommend this place and would stay here again."
5654,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Good, recently renovated hotel in a good location if you want to stay outside of central London. Lobby, bar and rooms are almost brand new and have a contemporary design. Breakfast was absolutely fantastic with a lot of choices Service by staff was inconsistent. Front desk staff were fantastic however bar staff were slightly rude. Would stay again considering price and facilities as a Hilton Gold Member"
5655,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,I've stayed at this Hilton several times within last few years and I have found the service to be consistently high. Rafid and his warm team have always gone over and beyond to ensure my stay is as smooth as possible. The hotel is clean with a new chic bar including lovely furnishings and helpful staff too.
5656,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Very friendly staff and the hotel is very nice and clean. The bar is open until 1pm. Very nice neighbourhood but not the ideal location if the stay is over a weekend and the plan is to be a lot in downtown London. Perfect location if you are going to a Chelsea game as it is only 10 min walk to Stamford Bridge. Tesco express is just across the street and there is a train station 3min away but was closed when we where there. Overall very nice.
5657,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"The hotel itself is lovely and very easy to to get to Chelsea FC grounds from the hotel. I requested early check in due to plans made when we arrived which I got for the 3 rooms booked requested room upgrade due to 30th birthday two rooms got upgraded but mine didn’t I needed two double beds. The room was clean, one bed was comfy and the other not so much the pillows need updating they are not comfy at all very lumpy. Paint finish needs looking at and bathroom needs upgrading. Breakfast was nice however they were short staffed so had to wait for fresh food to be made would be nice to make your own tea and coffee had to wait a long time to get a drink. Overall it’s a nice hotel Just a few miner things which would have made it much more relaxing"
5658,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Friendly helpful staff great value hotel It’s a slightly odd location but taxis are easy The tube is about 15 minutes walk away over ground train 2 minutes away We needed some help with Illness during our stay and the staff couldn’t have been more accommodating Super clean room clean room and hotel
5659,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"I’ve just returned from a 3 day break in London, staying at this hotel. I think the staff that checked us in were new as they tried to charge us again for our stay, but I showed proof we had already paid when we booked. Also, our room key wouldn’t work so I had to go back to reception. Luckily we were on the 2nd floor. I asked for water and they said it’s usually only given to people who have Hilton rewards, but the receptionist gave it to me anyway. I think this should be given as standard to be honest. Breakfast on Sunday was a bit chaotic and a few food items were missing. But breakfast on Monday and Tuesday was a lot more organised and pleasant. The rooms are of a good size..we had 2 double beds. The bathroom was small but finished to a high standard. The Crabtree and…"
5660,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"This hotel is on the other side of a significant investment, renovation and upgrade. Appreciated the check-in assistance of Kwai, and the responsiveness of the management team. I'll look forward to another stay soon. Many thanks for hospitality that makes a difference. (and this Diamond member hopes Doubletree globally will give its guests a healthy choice instead of chocolate chip cookies. Times have changed)"
5661,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Over all very nice and clean hotel. The staff were all helpful and welcoming atmosphere. The imperial wharf was closed during our stay so the next underground station was Fulham broadway that takes around 10-15 minutes to walk, it was a bit long walk at the end of the day and we ended up taking a taxi some evenings. Over all very nice hotel."
5662,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"We booked a two-night stay at Doubletree by Hilton at Chelsea. Check-in was fine, we were offered a Doubletree cookie on arrival. We were upgraded to an Executive Room which had a good range of facilities however it was smaller than we expected. The bathroom was ok with a powerful shower and a range of toiletries provided. The breakfast buffet was included as we are Diamond members, it was extensive with a large selection of hot and cold items. The hotel is in a convenient location being adjacent to Imperial Wharf Overground Station and is a short walk to Chelsea Harbour, we would happily stay again."
5663,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Pros: -Location is excellent. Right next to Imperial Wharf stn, a bus stop and lots of Cabs around. -Tesco Express across the street -5 minute walk to the Thames -Front desk staff and Bar staff were excellent. We especially loved the welcome cookies! So delicious! -Rooms were spacious and very clean. Bed was comfortable! -Bathroom was very clean! -Many restaurants and pub are within walking distance of about 5-15 mins. Walk for about 20 and you are by Knightsbridge area! Cons: -The bar was under construction when we got there and was completed the day we left. Would have loved to have nightcaps ! Over-all we loved our stay, the hotel was great, staff were super helpful and friendly! Will definitely stay there again!"
5664,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Myself and my family stayed at the DoubleTree Hilton In Chelsea for one night in December. We booked a room with 2 double beds which was great as a family room usually comes with a sofa bed. We booked the room through bookings.com and paid £271. This included a buffet style breakfast. I thought this was a pretty good price considering the location and type of room. The room itself was of a decent size with 2 double beds, a large wall mounted TV, storage, safe etc. The bathroom was also of a decent size with a over bath shower and all the features you would expect of a hotel bathroom. The room and bathroom were mostly clean apart from a few cleaning product marks in the bathroom, but nothing worth reporting. The location of the hotel is very close to a tube station which is…"
5665,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Nice refit (still ongoing Dec 22) with stylish decor, new funiture and carpeting but the rooms have paper thin walls, with much noise coming from rooms nearby. Coughing, sneezing and electrical plugs into sockets are all very loud and disturbing to any relaxation, particularly from 5am onwards. Plus the usual door bangers! Poor lighting in key areas of the room, entrance area / wardrobe are dark & the bathroom only has lighting around the mirror. No where else! Toilet seat is not robust enough and loose despite being new. Cleaning needs improvement as the clothes drawers had crumbs of food inside. The restaurant is more suited to being a small and intimate evening spot and is overloaded at breakfast. Tables are too close together in some areas. It is one of the refitted areas…"
5666,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Lovely and easy check in with warm cookies. Rooms have been refurbished and very clean and comfortable Location is great. The staff are absolutely fantastic ! The customer service and friendliness was on such a higher level to other hotels I’ve stayed in. I’m particular the blonde lady on reception - thank you ! Would stay here again definitely Lovely experience
5667,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"As a Hilton Honors diamond member, I’ve stayed in many Hilton’s. This is by far the best service I’ve ever received. The staff are amazing and in particular Sabina and Rafid! The best welcome ever. Thank you!"
5668,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"We selected this hotel because of the Hilton brand. Room we were given was right by the lift even though we were told the hotel had less than 50% occupancy - it appears from this and other things that happened during our stay that you get treated differently if you booked via a 3rd party. We booked two rooms using booking.com as Hilton direct could not match the price. Was still £150 paid for in full months in advance. We arrived early afternoon only to find no room service available at all during the 24hrs we stayed there, how can this be in the world wide chain of Hilton Hotels? Spent the day in London and decided to come back to the hotel at 11pm to have a couple of drinks to round the day off. No bar open or anywhere to get a drink in the hotel after 10:30pm on a…"
5669,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"I Stayed at the hilton hotel between the 19 and 21st. Very clean hotel and friendly staff, especially Hannah at breakfast service - very friendly and kept asking me if i needed anything! Will return back if ever in the area."
5670,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Took feedback on board. Listened to what we said and met every request. Excellent new rooms that are clean and modern. Great new large tv choices. Managers and outstanding her in terms of meeting customers needs. Of course the cookie on arrival is fantastic.
5671,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Very disappointing. Staff is friendly and I am honestly very laid back but this hotel needs a serious renovation - The walls are paper thin. Ican hear people talk and flush the toilet and watch tv. One of the 2 elevators doesn’t work so there is a huge line in the morning to leave( I usually take stairs but on the 5th floor and have a heavy bag ). And the room service forgot to replace the coffee capsules I used. The only good thing besides friendly staff is the hotel is next to Chelsea design center where I am working a trade show this week. But I will not come back to this hotel until it is renovated.
5672,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Good example of a Doubletree hotel by Hilton, rooms were a decent standard and all staff were very good. Slightly off the beaten track when depending on tube or trains. Wasn’t impressed by the lack of toiletries which Hilton is doing across all brands, still charging high room rates but removing amenities is a poor strategy, especially when the larger dispensers are empty as both soap and shampoo were during this stay. This is also unhygienic with all guests now touching these dispensers which are too large"
5673,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Very impressed with this hotel, excellent value for the price, wonderful staff, especially Joseph who assisted me with ordering pizza late night when my US credit card was blocked...he truly went above and beyond and is emblematic of the quality service they offer.."
5674,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"As always, the hotel staff team were welcoming and helpful. The hotel has had some refurbishment since I last stayed, and the rooms look really good with great facilities. Everything was kept in excellent order, and the restaurant also looks great after the refurbishment."
5675,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Brilliant hotel. Close to Stamford Bridge and Kings Road so ideal location. Very good service and immaculate rooms which were quiet. Good bar area and staff at this hotel were super helpful. Would definitely return.
5676,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Nice hotel, but needs to focus a bit more on the finer details, like cleanliness of the bar area. The cleaning staff need to be a bit more attentive as we had to remind the cleaning staff to refill the body wash in the shower"
5677,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Outstanding stay. The hotel is a bit off the beaten path but easily accessible by foot or bus from the Broadway Fulham underground station. Richard at the reception was very nice and offered me a great upgrade as a Hilton Honors Gold Member for a fantastic room. Breakfast was quite crowded but if you come at the end of the service its easier to get a table. I discovered you could ask for things like a cappuccino or an omelet and special thanks to Jaeger for exceptional service at breakfast bar!! All is all good quality for the price
5678,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"They stay at the hotel was not so great, however I travel all the time and never experience such outstanding customer service from the gentleman last name Harris! He did a wonderful job Magnificent customer service skills"
5679,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Well, what a find great hotel superb for business newly refurbed hotel and room excellent. highly recommend a stay meets all your needs the staff are absolutely fantastic nothing is too small or too much trouble best hotel i have stayed in for many years on business and socially."
5680,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"I really enjoyed my stay at the double tree Hilton in Chelsea, staff were very warm & welcoming at check in & thru out my stay there, I can’t fault anything lovely lovely staff, my room was cleaned to perfection, the room was nice… the shower was great. Room was very clean…Gd location for getting about Chelsea & Earls Court station & bars & restaurants near by… loved the Beaufort House Bar/restaurant which was quite near in Kings Rd. Highly recommend the doubletree & look forward to going back at some point. Thank you x"
5681,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Good quality food in restaurant. Staff were friendly and experienced both on check in and in the bar. Room cost was high but it is London prices. Coffee in room but no water. If was in this area again would return .
5682,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Great staff, Sabina was excellent check in, really friendly and very professional. Rooms are really nice, smallish (that’s London) great bed, great shower, well stocked bathroom with big fluffy towels. The air conditioning worked brilliantly, which is a plus. Excellent breakfast, great stuff!"
5683,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"The rooms at the back face a courtyard with no view. But they are quiet. Had difficulty with the parking but Cherine sorted it out. She is very good, also managed to organise connecting rooms for us, great attention to detail. Leban was also helpful. Great breakfast even if individually ordered omelettes took a while. The bathroom extractor fan did not work. I mentioned it, hopefully it gets fixed."
5684,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"It was a excellent stay, Great location, station is close by and very central, lots of varieties for breakfast. Friendly staff, Rafid was very helpful. Rooms space was good and overall services. Will come back again."
5685,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Excellent customer service made our stay. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they made my nine year old daughter very welcome. Room was of a high standard and breakfast good value. Highly recommended. Very close to train station which was great.
5686,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Newly renovated hotel in Chelsea at Imperial wharf, This hotel is located about 15-20 drive to the major attractions in London and approximately 45 minute drive from the airport. We arrived from airport many hours prior to check-in time. Front desk staff were great and accommodated us early and with an upgraded room. King room was very nicely appointed, modern and very clean. Room was on the smaller size but was very comfortable for two. The bed was very comfortable as were the 4 king-sized, down-filled pillows. Aside from the on-site amenities, there are several great restaurants within walking distace and there is a Tesco (express super-market) across the street. Overall a very pleasant stay at a reasonable price. A definite recommend."
5687,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Fantastic location, 2 minute walk from nearest train station and only minutes from city centre London. Staff were very accommodating and polite, from check in to breakfast to the bar at night they were excellent. Super choice of food at breakfast, nice bar menu and reasonably priced for the location. I will definitely be returning in the near future."
5688,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"The staff were extremely friendly, and accommodated all our needs. The hotel is clean and modern and breakfast was lovely. Not much to do around the location but overground train right next door to get around London easily."
5689,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Super location, just round the corner from Imperial Wharf on the overground line. Super friendly and efficient check in from Terri on reception. Spacious, clean and tidy room, very quiet. Forgot my plug for my phone charger, but they has USB ports in the room. Great selection at breakfast, we loved the pancake machine!"
5690,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Myself and my 2 children stayed here for 2 nights. It was a great for my childrens birthdays, which I advised the hotel of. They so kindly provided balloons and cakes in the room which the children were very excited about. The staff were really helpful and kind, the room was clean and a good size for the 3 of us. Highly recommend staying here."
5691,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"It was our 1st stayed in double tree Chelsea, we couldn’t fault anything. It was a great stay. Special thanks to Rafid, who was very helpful and professional. Also we had lots of choices at breakfast, throughly enjoyed."
5692,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,Greeted with a smile and a hot cookie what more could you want.. The room was absolutely fantastic. Honestly lost for words. The outside of the hotel was having some cosmetic work done but no problems. Very close to local transport for the bus and overground / underground. Perfection
5693,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"We had such a fantastic overnighter here. The room was spacious and comfortable, walk in shower, free cookies, great breakfast and professional staff. From reception, to the bar, to the breakfast room, all staff had a smile on their face and a happy greeting. We visit London quite often now and this will be our Go to hotel. We are double tree members and tge benefits are great. Thank you for an excellent stay. Massive thanks to the super positive bar and breakfast staff."
5694,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"Check in was so smooth room was good size, all staff respectful and so helpful Breakfast was delicious and plenty of choice never had to wait for a table , Location is great you have a overground train minute away and Fulham Broadway tube Station 10 minutes walk I’ll definitely stay here again Mr Mann Room 416 Thank you Hilton for a nice stay"
5695,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"2 night stay at this fabulous hotel. Really easy to get to. Of course ideal for Chlsea Harbour as we were meeting friends who live near hear. Staff were very accomodating, and the rooms were immaculate. I highly recommend!"
5696,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"If you're looking for a hotel to visit London, this is not the one. To give you an idea : Piccadilly Circus is about 1.5 hours to walk and about 45 minutes by taxi (expensive) and, if you're lucky, about the same by public transport (a mixture of walking, bus and tube... and a pain!) That said, if you need a hotel in this particlar area – which is actually nearer to Fulham than Sloane Square, then you could do much worse. The welcome was genuinely warm and we were made to feel appreciated. Despite checking in the previous day via the Hilton app., no room could be allocated, so we had to check in again at the front desk. The check in staff was charming and efficient and her trainee status was not evident. Our 6th floor room, well away from the renovation noise on the 1st floor…"
5697,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"The staff at this Doubletree are very courteous. They intend to assist in any way they are able. Unfortunately, because of construction on the hotel and the building next-door, I was jarred awake early in the morning after an all night flight. On the positive side, the rail into downtown London is just next-door. There is a Tesco across the street and is Sainsburys about a 15 min walk away. That is it. It is not conveniently located to the cosmopolitan experience that London has to offer. If that is not an issue, enjoy."
5698,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"We had another wonderful stay at Doubletree Chelsea. Checkin was helpful & informative. We stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms & a special mention to the light up wardrobes when you open the door! Yin at breakfast is a delight, he was always smiling & always so incredibly helpful to us so we feel a special mention should be made. Thank you to the team & look forward to seeing Anthony & you all again soon."
5699,DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel London - Chelsea,"I stayed for 3 nights. Day one; NO RUNNING WATER. Had to go to GYM across the street to shave & shower. That evening my room door was wedged wide open and my window was open. On day 3, breakfast was at 8am. I checked out early. Charged for breakfast"
5700,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We went to a birthday celebration in the Westgate suite. We were so impressed with the staff on that night , especially A lady called Yasmin who manged the event with such professionalism. I would totally recommend the venue for a private party . Thank you"
5701,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We were well looked after by the receptionist when we arrived and she even escorted us to our room and gave us useful information along the way re dining, breakfast etc. Room and bed were great as was breakfast. One real disappointment for me - I was driving that day and to and from our party in a nearby village so when we returned at 10.25pm i was looking forward to a quiet drink with my wife in the bar which shuts at 11.00pm. At 10.25pm on a Saturday night it was closed with no staff around at all - gutted really felt let down - a poor finish to what had been a good evening."
5702,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",We wandered in off the street looking for lunch and found it here.Great food in a very nice airy dining room. The food was very tasty we had pie of the day and veg curry and very pleased with it all. Staff really nice and efficient and all at a reasonable price. One of the Coaching Inns group and this is one coaching Inn! Will return deffo.
5703,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We’ve been visiting The Talbot Hotel regularly for over 50 years and have never been disappointed with our stay in this beautiful building which is steeped in history. The accommodation is extremely comfortable, the food and service first class and the staff very friendly and always professional, polite and helpful. We thoroughly recommend you make The Talbot Hotel ' . ' your first choice hotel"
5704,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We stayed at the Talbot this week and it was superb. Excellent and friendly staff, great food, fabulous room and bed. Overall brilliant experience and Oundle is charming, little town, can’t wait to go back.."
5705,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",Great stay with excellent customer service very good meals the room was clean and well equipped. The hotel is right in the centre of Oundle with some good shops and places to see. Parking was free with plenty of spaces although the car park was down a narrow back street which backed onto the rear of the hotel.
5706,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",Great place for a get away! We just had a quick over night stay at the Talbot as it isn’t terribly far from home so we just were treating ourselves after a day out riding the motorcycles on the great roads around the area.
5707,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Lovely weekend visiting local Historic Houses. Staying in this old coaching in was the perfect accompaniment. Staff were all fabulous; very friendly, nothing too much trouble. Room was very comfortable."
5708,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",Just what we expected. Staff are lovely especially the breakfast team - we didn’t dine there in the evening so can’t comment on the food. The room was clean. The only downside I could mention is it’s a little tired and needs a spruce up.
5709,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","A lovely stay in this historic hotel. The buildings ooze history and yet this is married with every modern facility you that you may need. Staff were friendly and efficient, the room was excellent and would highly recommend the cooked breakfast! You won't be disappointed if you stay....."
5710,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","What a great room great space great bathroom great shower. This was an of the cuff quick booking for a couple of days away, we couldn’t have planned this any better, Oundle was a fantastic town/village with plenty to at night."
5711,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Myself & a mate stayed one night in a twin room. Staff made us very welcome. The room was spotlessly clean & the bathroom also, with good quality toiletries. Beds very comfortable & apart from the occasional hum from the plant room, a good night's sleep was had. Breakfast was superb & again the staff were cheerful and attentive. The breakfast room was light & airy with a great garden behind. Great in summer but not so welcoming on a drizzly morning. All in all, a great value stay & wouls thoroughly recommend."
5712,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Overall, I would recommend this hotel. It's old and won't be to everyone's taste but it has an oldy worldy charm if you like that sort of thing. The communal areas of the hotel are quite good, the bar, the restaurant, the coffee house. I would probably pick a bigger room next time, one that may have more amenities, the standard rooms are quite basic and could do with a fresh lick of paint. The windows couldn't close and they do look quite grubby. Our room faced the courtyard and the restaurant so it wasn't as quiet as we would have liked. I can imagine in the summer, with the seating outside, no one would get any sleep. The room was unbearably hot and the bed too firm along with thin hard pillows. For the price, I think it would have been great to have a mini fridge in…"
5713,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Friendly staff, plenty of parking, our room was quiet , our bed was comfortable. Large bathroom with bath. Breakfast during the week from 7am which was handy if you needed to make an early start. Good breakfast cooked to order. Lovely dining room with good food, also a nice bar area with large windows and views of the garden."
5714,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","A very enjoyable couple of nights at the historic Talbot in the centre of Oundle. Efficient and friendly staff from Reception, Restaurant and in all corners of this Hotel. Good Restaurant and pleasant and relaxing bar/coffee shop area."
5715,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We called at oundle on the way home from Stilton and a stay at the Bell Inn. We decided to view the Talbot and have coffee and cake to get an impression of the inn. The hotel looks fab and the afternoon tea and service was good. However we sat as advised in a lovely seating area reserved from 2.15..it was 12.30 at the time. We are professional well educated adults and house trained but the rudest woman I believes was the manager..black dress, officious moved plates and cutlery away from us like we were lepers and remarked that the table was set out for a reservation and she didn't want it messing!. On the basis of this interaction I would be reluctant to return and we have stayed in 2 inns since xmas and travel a lot. The ambience is good but you need customer focussed person…"
5716,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We recently had a family birthday dinner, which was a lovely evening. We received helpful planning, a good meal and attentive service. The bar and restaurant were reasonably busy but we were well looked after."
5717,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Stayed for 2 nights on an excellent package which included dinner on one night. My husband, myself and our small dog were made to feel very welcome. The building itself is very attractive and Oundle is a nice place for a wander. The room had everything we needed, with a really comfy bed, lovely toiletries and fluffy towels. The food was excellent and worthy of a trip just for a meal. We have stayed in another hotel from the Coaching Inn chain and here, like there, we were not disappointed at all. We will definitely be booking others in the future or revisiting The Talbot. Thank you to all the staff who looked after us."
5718,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Wonderful evening at the Talbot on Thursday 9th March. We had the Coachman's buffet, with chips, it was excellent. Plenty of food for all. I can thoroughly recommend it. The staff were fabulous and should be commended."
5719,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Great little hotel, excellently located. Only negatives were the very small size of the room (we couldn’t get passed each other when getting ready) given the price, and that I went to breakfast (admittedly with only 15 minutes to the end) and much of the buffet had gone and wasn’t restocked (no bread etc)."
5720,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We stayed three nights in the Talbot and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were magnificent although at times there was evidence that they were overstretched. Upon our arrival, the receptionist was really helpful and took time to show us to our room and point out other ways of reaching various parts of the hotel.. Our room was spotless, the larger size bed was well made and comfortable. One thing we found lacking was the provision of sufficient electrical bedside sockets for charging the number of phones, watches and tablets that modern-day travellers have. Some of the sockets that were provided were round-pin. Referring to possible evidence of short-staffing were the need to locate a member of staff to serve at the bar at around 5:30 on the day of our arrival, and a…"
5721,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We really enjoyed our stay at The Talbot Hotel in Oundle whist visiting friends in Peterborough. The building was lovely and interesting and the staff very welcoming. Our basic room was spacious and clean, but my only criticism was the hard and flat pillows. They could be replaced to ensure a better night's sleep."
5722,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",Great experience with the staff and venue. Our parents (and parents in law) stayed overnight. From check in to check out they were well looked after. We joined them for 80th birthday meal. Fantastic food. Great service with the staff ensuring everything went smoothly and timings meant there was the right amount of time between courses. Thank you to the staff at the Talbot for making this such an enjoyable ocassion.
5723,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",Visited here today for afternoon tea Upon walking to my table was asked 'can I help you and escorted to my table like I wasn't Manet to be there The staff need to learn some respect Have spent many a time and muck money in this place but will not be treated this way and will not return
5724,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We had a family “get together” lunch here in the restaurant on Monday celebrating the recent arrival of our new great granddaughter. The food was excellent, we had fish & chips, pork belly, pie of the day and a Talbot burger. The Talbot team couldn’t have been more helpful and obliging, they made our visit very special. We’ve just booked another family member in to stay for the Easter weekend so that says it all really!"
5725,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","I love this building. You can feel the history of it. We stayed in the Mary Queen of Scots room. I love the view from the window. You can watch Oundle gradually come to life in the morning. There were lots of special little touches in the room - proper drinking glasses, a retro Roberts radio, complimentary literature, A really good coffee machine. The linen was excellent and the bed huge. There was always hot water. The TV worked properly. A real bonus was an actual bath in the bathroom. The food was excellent. The staff were very, very busy but always polite and very helpful."
5726,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",I have stayed on a weekly basis for the last 12 months and the rooms are of an excellent standard comfortable and very clean. I have sampled the menu many times and have never had a bad meal. Kelly and the team in the evening are exceptional in their customer service. I have really enjoyed my stay a truly friendly hotel
5727,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","This is a great hotel, with comfortable and well equipped rooms in a lovely location. The staff are always friendly, helpful and polite, and are always on hand to help. The eatery has a great selection of food, good wine and drink options, and breakfast is fantastic, i always enjoy staying here, free car pack as well."
5728,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Handy for Oundle school, rooms tired , dirty paint work stained carpets . No mini fridge. Couldn’t see tv from bedroom. Restaurant very regimented told where to sit no option to move even though empty . Poor choice menu and items unavailable. Not four star I am used to. Expensive £170."
5729,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We had a family get together to celebrate my wifes 65th birthday. We hired the Snug as it gave us a beautiful room, full of old charm and private enough to suit my wife's complicated health issues. Dorota and her team looked after us so well from the moment we arrived until the goodbyes some 4 hours later. I couldn't have asked for a better venue and host. Thanks to all at The Talbot for creating a long lasting memory, Richard, Navenby, UK"
5730,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Disappointing, but great location and great coffee shop next door. Food not hot, different size portions, run out of wine selection, deserts & no cheese board (Friday night) Staff friendly and rooms need updating."
5731,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","My husband recently travelled from Geneva to Oundle to attend a funeral. His flight was delayed by two hours so I phoned the hotel to let them know of his late arrival. I was anxious because he had booked and paid for a two course evening meal . He eventually arrived at 8.15. No one was at reception. A guest said he may find a member of staff in the bar. On asking a barman about his meal he was told the restaurant was shut ! He then asked for the key of his room. Eventually, an hour later he was given his key. Whilst waiting he had settled for a drink and crisps in lieu of his evening meal. The next morning, after a substandard cooked breakfast, he paid his bill and asked for a refund for the meal he never got, DESPITE , having let the hotel know of his delay. The day…"
5732,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","I stayed at the Talbot Hotel for 1 weekend night early in March 2023 and had an excellent stay. My room, which faced an interior garden, was very quiet and had 2 single beds that were very comfortable. The hotel staff were very helpful. Almost any one of them could answer any kind of question. When I managed to lock myself out of my room soon after my arrival, I was referred to the bar manager, who immediately accompanied me to my room to let me in. Parking around the back of the hotel was convenient. I highly recommend the Talbot Hotel for whatever reason you choose to visit Oundle, a lovely town."
5733,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",Came to Oundle to take part in a running event and really happy to have stayed in the Talbot. Really nice hotel with great rooms and brilliant staff in a very nicely kept historical building. Would be happy to visit again if in the same area.
5734,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Hotel is in a very good location for me in terms of my business. Breakfast was also of a very good standard and the service at Breakfast was very professional and friendly, as was reception. All round very satisfied."
5735,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Great hotel, very clean, Breakfast options could be a bit more expanded but it’s definitely a great hotel with great people. Beautiful 1600s ambience, artwork & decorations. Great hotel for history buffs"
5736,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle",We had to cancel our original booking owing to Covid but the lovely Knightess Gail rebooked us with a complimentary upgrade. We were able to meet and thank her on arrival.All the other staff were marvellous and the legendary Talbot breakfast was the icing on the cake.
5737,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","An amazing hotel with a fascinating history set in a stunning town. Staff were polite and helpful, room was great and food lovely My only issue was with the bar. We attended for a gig in the hotel. The bar at the venue was only allowed to serve during intervals. The information in the hotel room was that the bar closed to all at 11pm (already unusual that hotel guests could not be served later but accepted this was the case). What we didn’t expect that after the gig ended at 10.30pm around 25 of us went to the bar to find it had been closed and locked up from 10.15pm. Initially we were told it would not reopen but after several people complained the hotel staff very reluctantly reopened so we could all get a drink. After everyone was served however they re closed the bar at…"
5738,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Stayed here for 2 nights in February. Nice hotel, rooms very clean and very quiet. We would have stayed in the hotel for food & drink on the evening but found the bar area slightly lacking & would have benefitted from having the log fire lit on a cold Feb evening."
5739,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Wonderful stay, staff were super and memorable stay. You must stay at this hotel to enjoy the centuries of people staying and enjoying the history. You won’t regret the stay and will have lasting memerries."
5740,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Stayed over the weekend, one of the best coaching inns we have stayed in, very friendly and welcoming staff. The room was very spacious and well decorated. The evening meal was very good and well presented, the breakfast was also very good! Would highly recommend"
5741,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","What a fabulous overnight stay, we were expecting a garden room however, on arrival we were upgraded to a suite which was fabulous. Staff were very pleasant and helpful, our evening meal and breakfast was lovely. A lovely quaint market town well worth a visit boasting shops,eateries, coffee bars and a couple of pubs. Tap & Kitchen 10 minute walk and Dexters in centre both worth a must."
5742,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Lovely and characterful hotel in the centre of town with parking. We had a lovely night there as part of a secret escapes deal that included dinner and breakfast. Food was delicious and the staff were friendly and efficient. Our room was very comfortable with everything that we could want. Great place to stay, would recommend"
5743,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","I think we were lucky - we had a very cheap “deal” but ended up with a super room - “Barnwell Room” which is a decent sized bedroom, dressing room and huge bathroom. You could criticise the decor a bit but there was more to be grateful for. Big comfy chairs - we watched a bit of TV. We both slept very well - although we did bring our own pillows (good tip from other reviewers) . Lovely bathroom products - really lovely. One word of warning, breakfast finishes early at 9.30. We are very lazy and used to 10 or 11 so we missed it! Our fault completely, but be aware. We thought this was a super hotel although note we seemed to get lucky with our room - lots of other rooms are quite small and were probably taken by the business guys who appeared to be in town. Overall though, we…"
5744,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","This is my 5th visit in the last ten months to see my family who locally,l have always found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating ,the rooms are comfortable and very clean and a good breakfast is included in the daily rate. This hotel is situated right in the middle of Oundle and has its own parking"
5745,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Well worth your patience with the tedious stream of pre-arrival eMails demanding answers. The property is characterful, restaurant excellent and service in both there and in the bar outstanding and friendly"
5746,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","We had a overnight stay at the Talbot, the rooms was very nice,warm, comfortable and clean. We had a family dinner booked in the restaurant for 16 of which we pre-booked our meals. Our table was booked for 7.30. The starters came out at about 8.30, tables cleared and then about 45 minuets later the mains came out staggered so much that some meals had been eaten before others had got to the table and that continued for the puddings aswel. The service was really poor they was so short staffed. The bar closed at 11 0 clock of which we was asked if we would make our payments so they could close the tills. The whole evening was spoilt and this should have been a night out for all the family to celebrate a 60th birthday and all it resulted in was the birthday girl spending her entire…"
5747,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Amazing building, beautifully furnished, excellent well equipped bedroom. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast good, nothing too much trouble for our waitress. 1 or 2 disappointing factors with meals such as items missing from plates at dinner. Pastry in dessert and black pudding at breakfast were rock hard."
5748,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Lunch date ❤️ Second visit for lunch in this lovely, historic pub. Sat by the roaring fire, thawed out and had a lovely lunch. Served by very friendly staff. We will return … again 😂 We highly recommend this pub for lunch if you are in the area. A little gem"
5749,"The Talbot Hotel, Oundle","Room rather small. Had dinner in the restaurant, £17.00 for fish and chips , overpriced. Service in the restaurant was slow, considering the amount of staff on duty. Breakfast, very disappointing, presentation very sloppy. The two fried eggs, the whites were not cooked. Staff friendly. Overall not a bad stay but things could be improved."
5750,Kingsmills Hotel,"The spa side rooms were nice but ours must not receive many vacuumings. We found someone’s nail clippings on the carpeting near the patio door and there they remained for our stay. I would have asked staff about it but wanted to see how long it took to be cleaned up. The dinner in the older hotel dining room was a disappointment the one time we ate there. The menu was limited and the food was quite disappointing considering the hype the restaurant is given on their website. Very small salads, my pork loin had the appearance and taste of processed meat, not true pork loin, and lacked any seasonings. For the money, go into town and eat. It is both less expensive and better tasting food. The front desk staff and people working the morning breakfast buffet were very polite and…"
5751,Kingsmills Hotel,"Our stay at Kingsmills Hotel was very nice. The manager, Gregory, took care of every request we made as well as checking on us and our friends during our visit. Also, Lee the concierge was very friendly and helpful in getting us dinner reservations and transportation. The rooms were very nice and the food and bar service were very good. We will definitely stay at Kingmills Hotel whenever we travel to Scotland in the future!"
5752,Kingsmills Hotel,Stayed one night with party of 6. Grandkids included. They had a neat bunk bed set up for the young ones. Our room was spacious and quiet. Service was excellent and the staff was very accommodating would stay again
5753,Kingsmills Hotel,"The Kingsmills is a beautiful classic Scottish hotel. The rooms are very nice, comfortable and luxurious. The bed was very comfortable as was the couch in the room. The bathroom was well equipped with good quality toiletries. The breakfast buffet was fantastic with a great selection of delicious offerings. The brewed coffee was excellent. Dinner meals and a beautiful Afternoon Tea were exceptional. The Leisure Facilty was quite nice but, seriously charging guests ""One Pound"" to rent a towel. This felt a bit beneath a Superior Category Hotel like the Kingsmills. Perhaps consider charging your outside patrons but not your registed guests. I would definitely stay at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness again."
5754,Kingsmills Hotel,"This is a wonderful place to stay in Inverness. It is very well situated, and the hotel is comfortable. We had a first floor room with a view out into the garden. There is parking on site, and it really only takes about 3 to 4 minutes to get to the downtown area. The breakfast at the hotel is terrific, and they even have an entire section just for those who are gluten-free. The toaster is dedicated to only be for gluten-free items. It’s very nice to relax in the bar area in the evenings."
5755,Kingsmills Hotel,"Wealc stayed in the Resort Club. The room had a lovely balcony that overlooked the golf course. The room was very well appointed, with a good shower. Breakfast was good, not excellent, but good. Wifi was good. We ate off the bar menu and had excellent food and service."
5756,Kingsmills Hotel,We had a wonderful time at my daughters Babyshower. The room was beautiful and a perfect size for our group. The sandwiches and cakes were very good and all dietary requirements were met. The staff were very friendly and helpful even though the hotel was very busy. Communication with the hotel in the planning stage was excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
5757,Kingsmills Hotel,"I would like to thank the Kingsmills Hotel for a truly wonderful evening celebrating my 60th Birthday with my family. The presentation of the Adams room, the staff, the menu, the food and the service were first class. Thank you. Regards Tanya"
5758,Kingsmills Hotel,"Myself and family attended the Kingsmills on Saturday for a surprise 80th birthday party. The events staff had arranged the room perfectly and the staff looking after us were first class. Great service (particularly Charlene, I’m sure that was her name), excellent food and a superb venue made for an amazing family gathering. Cannot recommend the staff and management at Kingsmills highly enough and would thoroughly recommend it for a party or function."
5759,Kingsmills Hotel,"An outstanding hotel, fantastic staff and a wonderful atmosphere. The rooms are fabulous, clean and on point for a family. Easily recommend for anyone wanting a top class stay in Inverness. My family loved the food and the high level of service."
5760,Kingsmills Hotel,We used the hotel as a base for our golf trip. Staff were very welcoming and professional and dealt with a glitch in our booking very professionally. Speculation mention to Pam on reception who is great. The food is good with breakfast in particular really great value and service of concierge and bar staff is attentive and delivered with real warmth. Spa and gym needs a refresh but we were told that this is planned
5761,Kingsmills Hotel,"We reached out to Kingsmills Hotel to host Culloden Academy's S6 Senior Dance this year. From our intital email to the night of the event we were so well looked after from the events team. Nothing was an issue for the staff and their expertise shone on the night. We were offered an excellent choice of menus to choose from at very reasonable prices. All pupils and staff raved about the quality of the food, the excellent service and the fantastic entertainment on the night. This was our very first prom held at Kingsmills and we will certainly be returning next year. A fantastic evening we cannot wait to repeat!"
5762,Kingsmills Hotel,"I’ve stayed at this hotel before a few times, although this is the first time I’ve visited with a group of friends We were looking for a quiet, relaxing getaway so decided to order room service for dinner rather than eat in any of the restaurants as it was extremely busy. We had a dinner allowance included in the rate of £43pp. Obviously it’s a struggle to spend this amount on the room service menu so asked if a soft drink could be included in the rate. Was told initially by a male member of the reception team that this would be absolutely fine, only to be told 2 seconds later that a soft drink couldn’t be included AND that a hefty tray charge of £8.50 would also be chargeable and could not be deducted from the £43 allowance!!!! I’m was a little disappointed that even after…"
5763,Kingsmills Hotel,"Our third visit to the Kingsmills Hotel and it never disappoints. Staff, food, accommodation ... perfect!! Staff are friendly, helpful and go above and beyond to assist in any way they can. We loved the breakfast .. plenty of choice and attentive staff."
5764,Kingsmills Hotel,"I can't recommend this hotel highly enough, especially if you are travelling with dogs. We have just spent two nights here in a garden room with our two large breed dogs . I have never been in such a beautiful room that allows dogs . When the hotel states they are dog friendly, they really are, and dogs are allowed into the large lobby area of the hotel, too. Every dog was fussed over. We were even given a great recommendation for a secure dog wood to try for our very nervous Pointer . Thank you to the lovely receptionist ( sorry, I can't remember your name) for the suggestion From the start to the finish of our stay, we were treated with first class service from the mixed range of ages of staff. All were very friendly and professional . The food was lovely . Yes, it is quite…"
5765,Kingsmills Hotel,This hotel has gone above and beyond with their hospitality and attention to detail. Our room was very spacious modern and perfectly clean with fantastic toiletries to use on our stay. Breakfast was outstanding outstanding with brilliant choice and service. The spa facilities were spot on and the treatments were amazing. A big shout out to the fabulous receptionist called Pam who is an absolute delight and went over and above to book the spa treatments in at short notice.
5766,Kingsmills Hotel,We enjoyed a nice room with a small garden setting off our room. The room was large and tastefully decorated. It does have limited toiletries . The other issue was intermittent wifi. Breakfast is buffet style and with a good range. The let down for us was the check in service. We have become accustomed through our visit across Scotland to extremely welcoming and helpful service as soon as we enter a hotel. We didn’t experience this here. It was efficient but the person who checked us in did not show any initiative in offering any information or advice. It is a nice pleasant 15 minute walk into the centre of town and for a walk along the River Ness
5767,Kingsmills Hotel,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Duo Spa Package at the Kings Club Leisure Facility. All staff were very friendly and attentive from start to finish, especially Nora and Chloe. A lovely, relaxing experience. The lunch was really delicious too. We're already booked in again."
5768,Kingsmills Hotel,Would like to say that the staff were amazing especially Pam who couldn’t do more for us as a family The hotel was very clean And the staff took so much pride in there establishment It was a all round good experience and Roubin Was very helpful when trying to sort out a room to suite my family A wel done to all the staff
5769,Kingsmills Hotel,"This was such a welcoming hotel! Staff were happy, friendly and looked very smart! The room was beautiful and the while hotel was clean and beautiful. The breakfast was lovely with a brilliant view outside the conservatory. There was a wide selection of breakfast available."
5770,Kingsmills Hotel,"We can’t recommend this hotel enough from start to finish. We stayed for 2 nights and it started with the welcome which was second to none from the concierge to the girls at the desk. Our room was large with a bed that could fit 4 adults, let alone 2. The shower was huge and made a big man feel small. We drank and ate the first night, the second night we had drinks before we went into town for a meal and after. The young staff, especially the service girl with the dark haired pony tail in the lounge bar, was a breath of fresh air and very professional. You always expect the mature staff to be considerate but I have to say ALL of the young staff were as professional, smiling and willing to listen to “mature” guests. I have to give another special mention to the very young lady…"
5771,Kingsmills Hotel,We stayed in a family room for one night with our two young children. The room was lovely and the kids enjoyed the pool! Our room wasn’t ready when we arrived so we were given complimentary drinks though the wait was less than 10 minutes. The breakfast was excellent and the salmon was delicious (and the serving had lots of it!). Staff were exceptional. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.
5772,Kingsmills Hotel,"I cannot speak highly enough about all the staff at this hotel. They were absolutely brilliant, so helpful, friendly and welcoming and nothing was too much bother. We had such fun there and all due to the wonderful staff."
5773,Kingsmills Hotel,We were so looking forward to our stay and celebrating our 38th Wedding Anniversary but due to a sudden and shocked family critical illness with news your family member has days to live. We called and emailed to advise the situation and cancel our stay. We asked if we could reschedule and even to pay more for a later time in the year and our reponse was No and No refund of any money at all from this hotel . Thanks for your support during this exceptional difficult time!!
5774,Kingsmills Hotel,"Unfortunately I found the hotel poor, ladies downstairs toilet wasn't working, cold water shower could not get any hot water, dog hair all over the carpet, I was supposed to stay for a week but only stayed for two days, due to family emergency at home, when checking out still ended up paying for week."
5775,Kingsmills Hotel,"Great experience, no complaints. Very clean and tidy, modern shower with very hot water even at 4am. Very good dinner menu, recommend the steak locally sourced. Staff excellent, under promise and over deliver."
5776,Kingsmills Hotel,"We had a pleasant surprise on arrival that our room had been upgraded. Len, the Concierge, helped escort us with our bags to our room. There was a comfortable sofa and not one, but 2 televisions, the 2nd wall mounted was in the bunk bed side room. The bathroom was extremely spacious, and the wardrobe included a safe, iron and ironing board."
5777,Kingsmills Hotel,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay in a garden room during March. From arrival to departure we experienced nothing but friendly, helpful, professional, happy staff. The facilities were great, from the pool, sauna and fitness centre to the spa. Easy to book treatments and good value for money. Breakfast, buffet style was fresh and plentiful. Restaurant was always busy and had a good atmosphere. staff were all friendly, Charlene was our favourite, attentive and with a good sense of humour. Menu and quality of food and cooking was excellent. It really felt that this hotel was a good place to work. From the Manager who checked us in to all the bar staff, housekeepers, waiters and reception everyone went out of their way to make our short stay enjoyable. Would highly recommend and…"
5778,Kingsmills Hotel,"What a night! I recently went to the Kingsmills Hotel for a charity fundraiser down in the banqueting suite. I was part of the performance so was involved from the planning stage. The team worked so hard right from the beginning, giving clear communication and we’re always highly organised and professional. The night itself was out of this world. The room looked fantastic! With 280 people attending I wondered what the food would be like- I don’t know how they do it! Exceptional and discrete service by all, and delicious food. We had a scotch egg to start, I still don’t know how they managed to get the yolk so perfect! 👌 we had a room over night in the luxury room which was spotlessly clean, and had such a large bathroom and a big comfy bed! I didn’t manage breakfast but friends…"
5779,Kingsmills Hotel,"Excellent stay in Kings Club could not fault it, staff all fantastic as was breakfast., Only let down is the parking especially when a conference is on, went around for 10mins to eventually find a space"
5780,Kingsmills Hotel,"What a beautiful hotel. The staff went out there way to help. So friendly and made you feel so welcome. We stayed for a week over Christmas and I will honestly say it was an amazing Christmas because of this hotel. The Christmas Dinner was second to none. The cleanliness of the hotel inside and out no matter where you were was spotless. Breakfast was excellent, the spa is to die for, we have booked again for this year."
5781,Kingsmills Hotel,"Lost for words with this.... My Girlfriend had booked a couple of nights stay for my 41st birthday and everyone we spoke to could only say good things about the venue, we were really excited to get away to relax and unwind, but it soon turned into a complete nightmare... From the minute we arrived in the Whiskey bar, around 5pm on the 19th of March, we were met by a man in a wheelchair shouting to the staff about how bad his meal was, then our waitress had to go to the kitchen to find out what the soup of the day was (@5pm in a luxury hotel, i would atleast expect the staff to know what they have been serving for half the day), then they forgot half of our drinks order, so not the best introduction to a 4☆ experience. As we leave the restaurant, I ask the receptionist to…"
5782,Kingsmills Hotel,"We got married in Dec 22, we live in Australia so the wedding was arranged from a far. The staff at the Kingsmills made this very easy. Aileen the events coordinator was professional, efficient and friendly, making this process as stress free as possible. All the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, nothing was to much trouble. The facilities, food/drink and the welcome highly recommended for any event but especially a wedding. Thanks to all involved. We will be back next time we are home"
5783,Kingsmills Hotel,"This hotel was top notch, The rooms are spacious and clean. The staff are all amazing, the restaurant is great, food was delicious. The whisky tasting was to die for, breakfast in the morning was also perfect"
5784,Kingsmills Hotel,"Room clean, most staff very helpful Breakfast items in buffet were missing, bacon, toast and butter. All items missing had to ask three members of staff for replenishment and then wait some time. Noise level at night appalling. Wedding party i assumed. Fighting and swearing by guests left unchecked. This also continued into breakfast time when the persons were in lounge and not even having breakfast. Had to speak to three members of staff again for any action. They also said they were happy and seemed reluctant to ask for the noise to be lowered. I was told that the night Noise should have been reported at the time. Why should I get out of bed and phone reception when staff could hear both at night and breakfast and do nothing. The manager receiving guests at breakfast was very…"
5785,Kingsmills Hotel,"Came for a weekend break to this lovely hotel. wonderful hotel. Highly recommend. The spa was a highlight for us, and I enjoyed the most wonderful “ sublime” facial from Nora the spa manager. Totally chilled!Lovely people, lovely facilities and a wide variety of treatments. We’ll be back!"
5786,Kingsmills Hotel,Not pleased with room experience the slight order smell and the shower gel was empty and bathtub was dirty/ stained with dirt… I have visited there many of times and enjoyed it and always barged about it… this time it was terrible…… never again
5787,Kingsmills Hotel,"Booked in for a nice relaxing break for my birthday. From the time I arrived to the time I departed (12th-14th March 2023). Very smartly dressed reception staff, always smiling, their helpfulness & going above & beyond to make your stay enjoyable. When I booked through the hotel itself, I requested a bath in the ensuite (which glad I did, as only few rooms with a bath with the package I got. Reception, is spacious, clean, comfy sofa's & chairs. Concierge on left hand side of reception, which Gregor also goes the extra mile, he is very knowledgeable, welcoming. Did bring a tear (or 2) with my birthday plate & a glass of wine. Ensuite bedroom was massive, huge bed. Sofa, chairs, coffee table, long mirror, 2 large mirrors on walls. Tea/coffee tray with kettle & shortbread…"
5788,Kingsmills Hotel,"We had a two special birthdays to celebrate and after calling many hotels in the area we decided on the Kingmills hotel. From our first phone call, the events team were very helpful and did all they could to meet our needs and nothing was a problem. They gave us a gorgeous room which was a perfect size for the 19 of us. The table was set lovely and they allowed us to decorate and put up a lovely table for the cakes. The concierge was so helpful, professional and friendly. We had a photographer coming and they cornered off a lovely area for us to get the photos done. Our waitress and the bar staff were fantastic. The meal was a set menu with really lovely choices and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend the hotel for any functions as all the staff from the start to…"
5789,Kingsmills Hotel,"My husband and I have just sent a week at the Kingsclub at Kingsmill Hotel. My husband was receiving daily cancer treatment at the nearby hospital and returning with me to a beautiful luxurious room every day. It was spotlessly clean, peaceful with an amazing view, and really turned out to be the perfect place to recover from treatment. The staff in both buildings were. so professional. They take the time to find out a little about you and your circumstances and are so thoughtful and kind throughout. Special thanks to Pam on reception, who welcomed us as if we were royalty and couldn't have been more caring and helpful. In a sea of uncertainty, the Kingsmill was like a safe harbour in a storm. The team is obviously hand picked and possibly by the guest services manager…"
5790,Kingsmills Hotel,"Another great stay at the Kingsmill now sadly over. This time we were in a Kingsclub room which as expected was very comfortable and spotlessly clean with all the expected extras. The only thing is we were very close to the entrance foyer which meant we heard other noisy guests coming in at midnight one night when they were talking loudly outside our room. As always we made good use of the leisure facilities and on this visit i used the spa for the first time when i had a very relaxing hot stone massage. The lounge area in the main building is always a very relaxing place to sit and i'm pleased to report they still serve smoked salmon & cream cheese sandwiches in there! As always though, its the staff at the Kingsmill who make it what it is. All of them smile and say hello and…"
5791,Kingsmills Hotel,Just back from a two night break with my husband We stayed in the kings club building in a retreat room with balcony overlooking the golf course which was lovely … we ate both nights in the hotel and food was good and staff very attentive All the staff we came across were very friendly and efficient but a special mention to Pam on reception who welcomed us warmly to the hotel and made sure everything was perfect for us.
5792,Kingsmills Hotel,"Just back from a 2 night break at The Kingsmill and it was great. We stayed in a Kingsclub room, it was a great size, with a king sized bed, brilliant rainfall shower and massive bath tub. We had breakfast both mornings of our stay and the food was excellent, good quality and no shortage of anything. A full cooked breakfast day and porridge, toast and pastries the next. We also made use of the hotel's spa facilities on both days. There's a swimming pool, sauna, steamroom, jacuzzi and gym area too. During our weekend stay, we had no issue getting parked at any point as there is plenty of parking spaces. Credit also to all of the staff members we encountered, all were friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel is a 15 minute walk or 5 minute drive to the centre of town. Close…"
5793,Kingsmills Hotel,"What a great hotel with lovely rooms, friendly staff and delicious breakfast. I took my brother for his 40th and he certainly made good use of thr spa facilities and unlimited brekkie! I thought the 4pm check in time was a bit late in my opinion though."
5794,Kingsmills Hotel,"Pet friendly hotel, but no provisions made for the dog although charged £20 per night also a lack of poo bins in the grounds. Staff was very friendly and really helpful, room was a good size and bed was firm but comfortable, would recommend this hotel to friends. Clean hotel lovely grounds and plenty of area to sit with our dog at reception. Only problem was our TV was not working which we did report twice but still not working properly. Food was of good quality but expensive in restaurant."
5795,Kingsmills Hotel,"This was our sixth stay in this hotel, so was a bit disappointed to see that things need to be updated now, and attention to simple detail being missed. We stayed in the Kings club and this is rated as a four star hotel, but simple things like stained towels and no covers on knobs on showers, we shall not be returning!! Hotel reception were informed twice of these points."
5796,Kingsmills Hotel,"My wife and I stayed at The Kingsmill's Hotel two nights ago during our road trip through the Highlands. On arrival the Hotel impressed us with its location, décor etc and friendly check-in team. There seems to be two parts to this hotel, one a more traditional Scottish style hotel building and then a more modern annex across the carpark. After check-in we went to our room which was decorated in a darker traditional style but still pleasant with some character. Unfortunately, there was a technical issue with the heating in our room.....either that or we were too stupid to figure out how to turn it on....but I suspect it was the former as the staff had already left a little portable electrical heater switched on in the room before we arrived. Sadly it just wasn't taking…"
5797,Kingsmills Hotel,"The staff were very pleasant. The breakfast was excellent and the evening meal was good. However my big complaint would be the decor in the room. The furniture was decade's old, in poor repair and quite ugly. We were in room 100 and I believe not all rooms are like this. I would not stay here again."
5798,Kingsmills Hotel,"Our favourite in Inverness, lovely clean rooms and bathrooms, pool, steam room and new sauna, what’s not to like, visit this place several times a year…love, love,!love it, receptionbstaffvarecslways very welcoming"
5799,Kingsmills Hotel,"Beautiful hotel, very helpful friendly staff and an amazing breakfast. Staff went out their way to retrieve my mobile phone, the breakfast was freshly cooked and quality produce, chef even gave us some bakery products to take away. The room was outstanding with a beautiful view."
