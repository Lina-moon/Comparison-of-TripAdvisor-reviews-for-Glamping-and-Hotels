            "10 [<span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>AMAZING! From start to finish what a beautiful place to stay. Clean, fresh and private. Hamper package on arrival and self easy check in. Wish the hot tub could of been a bit hotter, but that is the only point i would say. Booking our next stay next week! 1000% reccomend.</span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>What an amazing place High Oaks is. An absolute gem! Found by complete accident via a Google search, we had looked forward to our trip for many months and it did not disappoint. The lodge was well equipped with all home comforts including a welcome hamper!  The site is quiet and you don’t feel too close to the next lodge. The dog walking field is amazing, perfect. We didn’t want to leave and can’t wait to rebook our next visit. Thank you for making our first holiday in a long while fantastic, Sarah &amp; Andy.</span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>Everything about this place is lovely. There is everything you should need in the lodge.  From dish cloths to dressing gowns and slippers. The welcome hamper is a lovely add on.    Even though it is just outside pickering it not far from lots of beautiful places to visit.  I have been here twice now and will definitely go again.  Louise Browne </span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>We stayed at The Grange for a celebration of three peoples 60th birthdays this year.  We found the accommodation was of a high standard and equipped for all our needs.  Loved the fluffy dressing gowns.  Nice touches of a welcome pack and supplies of tea, coffee sugar to keep us going.  The spa/pool was perfect.  It was just a struggle to get the cover back on.  Would go back again, maybe with family but would also like to try one of the smaller properties.  Excellent location in between Thornton le Dale and Pickering.  Its walkable but can take over 30 minutes.</span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>Fantastic stay. We stayed at High Oaks before and loved it but felt this was an even better experience. The cottage was immaculately clean with everything we needed. It was such a treat to stay somewhere where we could relax as soon as we arrived. Great facilities and area.</span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>Stunning little place to stay we did 3 nights in the wood pecker lodge and didn’t want to leave, thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Such a lovely quiet little get away we will be booking to return next June can’t wait 🥰 the kids loved the hot tub and PS4 most of all. 😂👍</span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>We stayed in wagtail Lodge and it was exceptional.  Beautifully clean and with extras which made a difference. For example the bbq was already ready with charcoal in there, and with the towels there were bathrobes which were handy for in between dips in the hot tub.  It was very well equipped and the garden area was lovely, with plenty garden furniture,  and due to the sunny North Yorkshire weather (this is true) we enjoyed relaxing in the sun and having bbqs each evening.  It was a peaceful place to stay but easy access to nearby towns. Would definitely return and would recommend.  Julie Stables and family.</span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>Fantastic stay - 2 couples with 2 babies under 1 &amp; a dog. Lodge was perfect, had everything we could possibly need &amp; more! Welcome hamper was a lovely touch to start off our weekend. Will be recommending and looking to come back soon!  Claudia </span></span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>We stayed in Elderberry Lodge and it is absolutely stunning. The Lodge has its own private garden with large grassed area and huge decking area with comfortable seating and also an outdoor table and chairs plus a great little BBQ and let's not forget the hot tub . From the moment you walk through the door of the Lodge you know you are somewhere pretty special. The decor and furnishings are immaculate ,comfortable and modern . The Lodge is very well equipped they have thought of everything you get dressing gowns and slippers a lovely hamper with coffee,  biscuits,  crisps , milk and cold water in the fridge even the dogs get treats 😊 . The little things I noticed were how precise and neat the cutlery was laid out in the draw everything has just been done with such attention to</span><span class=\"_\"> detail. The staff are great and the grounds are beautifully kept they obviously work very hard and it shows . If you want a lovely peaceful place to stay then I can not recommend enough. We walked around the grounds and I would happily stay in any of the accommodation but if you have a dog then the cottages and Elderberry Lodge are the ones with their own garden . Lots of things to do in the area so great if you have children and the grounds have a lovely children's play area that they can enjoy without you worrying about them as the grounds are so private and quiet. Thank you High oaks Grange for a fabulous stay </span>…</span>, <span class=\"QewHA H4 _a\"><span>We have just come back for a week at High Oaks Grange, staying in Willow Lodge. I have to say it is one of the nicest lodges we have stayed in. Beautiful setting, very peaceful and a lovely farm shop at the bottom of the driveway. The lodge itself was luxurious and well equipped with everything you may need, even treats for the dog. We would definitely recommend High Oaks Grange and will certainly return if we are in the area again. Many thanks</span></span>]\n"
